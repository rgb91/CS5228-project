1277||A AWASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.
The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent.

The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.
The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households.###1278||The House Natural Resources Committee held a field hearing in Fresno Wednesday seeking solutions to the California water crisis.

The new Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released today (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND).

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer.
And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.
The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said.
Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account.###1563||"We had heard the concerns raised in the letter and had reached out to a number of members of Congress prior to this letter to address those concerns," said Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller.
