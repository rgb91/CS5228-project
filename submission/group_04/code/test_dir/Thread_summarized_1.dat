But McKinsey, a leading management consulting firm, polled about 2,100 exchange-eligible Americans in February, and found only 27 percent of people who had picked a plan were previously uninsured.
With 5 million total enrollments, that would be about 715,500 previously uninsured Americans who had chosen and paid for new insurance.
It's also been hard to get a handle on how many previously uninsured people have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion in the states that chose to offer it.

Twenty-nine bank holding companies held up in the worst-case scenario with a cumulative 7.8 percent Tier 1 common ratio, a basic measure of capital strength, down from 11.5 percent at the end of the third quarter last year, but ending well above the 5.0 percent minimum target.
The banks were measured against a situation when real gross domestic product contracts 4.75 percent, the unemployment rate hits 11.25 percent, equities shed half their value and home prices lose a quarter of their value.

In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said.
"However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance.
If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###1066||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Integrated Secure Identification Systems (iSIS) is the result of R&D from engineers at The Royal Mint that has so far seen £2m of investment into a coin that will have ‘covert’ security embedded into it for the first time.
Launched in May 2013, iSIS is said to give coins three tiers of ‘banknote-strength security’ that can be authenticated through high-speed automated detection.
Expected to be introduced in 2017, the new 12-sided coin will be constructed from two different – but as yet unspecified – coloured metals.
According to Royal Mint, iSIS is expected to reduce costs by replacing expensive clad and homogeneous coins with a more affordable full-plated option rather than a surface coating that is prone to wear over time.###1102||###1103||Why did this happen?

Like movies and music before them, video games are increasingly shifting from physical discs to digital downloads.
But there are still many reasons that gamers would prefer to own a physical copy, and so physical games live on for the time being.
