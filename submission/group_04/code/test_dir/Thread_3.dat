1915||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake. Pending approval, the dodecagonal prism will replace the current cylindrical design, and will feature a number of security measures to prevent counterfeiting. The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

[R]eports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

"He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he added.###1922||Airbnb in funding talks at $US10bn valuation

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###1924||Empty###1925||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1926||Empty###1927||Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with Visa and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

Earlier today in response to Turkey Blocks Access to Twitter for National Security Reasons I commented ...



"No one will see the "power" of the Turkish Republic in idea suppression announcements. They will see the arrogance, cowardice, and desperation of prime minister Erdogan."



Twitter Use Breaks New Record



Tonight I am pleased to report Twitter Use Jumps to New High in Turkey

Turkish users of Twitter, including the country's president, have flouted a block on the social media platform by using text messaging services or disguising the location of their computers to continue posting messages on the site.



In what many Twitter users in Turkey called a "digital coup", Telecom regulators enforced four court orders to restrict access to Twitter on Thursday night, just hours after the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vowed to "eradicate" the microblogging platform in an election speech.



The disruption followed previous government threats to clamp down on the social media and caused widespread outrage inside and outside Turkey. In a first reaction to the ban, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the European commission, tweeted: "The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is."



Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: "The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards."



The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.



On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets – 17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting records for Twitter use in the country. "Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan," posted @Fakir_Bey. "And yours?"



Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Isik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.



Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.



Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter "a menace to society".



Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.



"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism," said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.

Arrogance, Cowardice, Desperation



So much for the extreme arrogance of Prime minister Erdogan who banned Twitter for "national security" reasons.



Erdogan told an election rally in the western city of Bursa "The international community can say this or that – I don’t care. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic."



Erdogan is a complete fool who is now officially "burnt toast". He is gone except by military force, and even that won't last.



Please tweet this post in the appropriate places, especially my comment (slightly modified) to fit tweet length ...

No one will see the "Power of the Republic" in Erdogan's announcement. They will see arrogance, cowardice, and desperation.



By the way, if you get the idea things are blowing up all over Europe, it's because they are.

FILE - In this March 14, 2014, file photo, trader Gregory Rowe, center, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. World s###1931||Empty###1932||Washington/Sydney: French satellite scans provided fresh indications of objects adrift in part of the Indian Ocean that’s being scoured for the missing plane—Malaysia Airlines MH370—backing up Chinese evidence, as more planes and ships joined the hunt.

Eight aircraft searched 59,000sq.km of sea after China on Saturday revealed a satellite photo depicting a floating object 22.5mt (74 feet) long. Radar images from French authorities show potential objects in the vicinity, Malaysia’s transport ministry said on Sunday.

The developments rekindled prospects for breakthrough in the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 after radar and visual scans failed to find objects spotted in earlier images taken from space. Searchers, bolstered by a growing fleet of international vessels, also want to locate a wooden pallet seen from the air to check if it could have come from the jet’s hold.

“The aircraft are operating at extreme ranges,” said Australian Maritime Safety Authority official Mike Barton, “with the closest airfield 2,500km away”. “They’re operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of 1-2 hours in the search area.”

The Chinese photo, taken 18 March, is focused 90 degrees east and almost 45 degrees south, versus almost 91 degrees east and 44 degrees south for similar items on a 16 March satellite image, putting the object 120km southwest of that sighting, according to China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

Coloured straps

The dimensions appear similar to those of the larger of two objects seen previously, said to be 24mt long. The Malaysian plane, a The Boeing Co. 777-200, measures 63mt, with a wingspan of 61mt and a 6.2mt cabin diameter.

“French satellite images were received this morning and have been sent to the Australian centre leading the search in the southern Indian Ocean,” a Malaysian government statement said.

The French foreign affairs ministry said radar echoes had detected floating debris 2,300km from Perth and that extra satellites would be mobilized to pursue the search. No date or coordinates for the discovery were immediately provided.

“Separately, the wooden pallet spotted on Saturday from a civil search aircraft was among a number of small objects spread over 5km and could be of the kind used in planes,” the AMSA’s Barton told reporters on Sunday, adding that there appeared to be evidence of multi-coloured strapping belts around it. “The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry,” Barton said. “They’re usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft.”

Ships converge

A New Zealand P3 Orion surveillance plane dispatched to the scene on Saturday found only clumps of seaweed. “The more aircraft we have, the more ships we have, the more confident we are of recovering whatever material is down there,” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Sunday in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, according to a transcript. “Obviously before we can be too specific about what it might be, we do actually need to recover some of this material.”

As more potential debris is spotted, a growing fleet of vessels is converging on the area, while the number of planes deployed was increased to eight from six on Sunday, including four long-range civil aircraft and a US Navy P8 Poseidon.

HMAS Success from the Royal Australian Navy has joined the search, while the Ocean Shield, equipped with a sub-sea remotely operated vehicle, is on its way to the zone, as is HMS Echo, a specialist ship from Britain’s Royal Navy that’s fitted with underwater listening gear and devices to survey the seabed.

Sea fog

“The US was asked by Malaysia to provide similar search technology,” the US defence department said in a statement. Australia said two merchant vessels assisted in the hunt on Saturday, while China deployed at least seven ships, according to the Xinhua News Agency, a flotilla that reflects the urgency it attaches to finding Flight MH370, whose complement of 239 passengers and crew included more than 150 Chinese nationals.

“Sea fog hampered the search early on Sunday before conditions improved, though there were no sightings of significance before nightfall,” the AMAS said.

“Two Chinese Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft will join the hunt from Perth tomorrow and two Japanese P3 Orions left for the West Australian city today,” the Malaysian govt said.

“Two Indian military planes are also headed to the northern part of the zone. A US Orion plane is operating out of Malaysia and is scanning south of Indonesia in the vicinity of the Cocos Islands,” Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an e-mail. “The plane had previously been searching for debris in the Bay of Bengal.”

FBI role

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also joined the probe as Malaysian authorities seek data from a home computer flight simulator belonging to the jet’s captain.

The FBI has received digital media from Malaysian authorities, including information from the simulator’s hard drive, and technicians are examining the data in Virginia, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the case who asked not to be named because the probe is ongoing.

“Investigators are trying to learn more about what the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, did on the simulator, and part of that effort involves trying to examine files that may have been deleted from the drive,” the official said.

FBI agent Michael Kortan, a spokesman for the bureau, declined to comment. “The simulator hasn’t produced any clear lead yet for investigators,” Malaysia’s acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Saturday.

“Neither have authorities found any link between the aircraft’s cargo, which included lithium batteries, and its disappearance,” Hishammuddin said. “My biggest concern is that if we are not able to identify the debris, having to go back to the two corridors is a huge and massive area,” he said. “This is unprecedented.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said that the jet emitted pulse-like signals to a satellite about seven hours after last making voice contact, shifting the focus of the search to two arcs, one extending north to Kazakhstan and the other into the southern Indian Ocean. “In the northern zone, there have been no indications of the missing airplane on radar in China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,” Hishammuddin said.

Tropical cyclone

“Already facing strong currents and rough seas, the Indian Ocean search could be disrupted by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gillian,” Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, head of Malaysia’s civil aviation authority, told reporters near Kuala Lumpur airport. The storm is about 2,500km northwest of Perth, having passed over Christmas Island, and tracking slowly south.

Steady flight

An analysis of satellite pings shows that the Malaysian Airline System BHD 777 may have flown steadily across the ocean after diverting from its scheduled route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. That assessment gave the clearest idea yet on how investigators pinpointed a search zone.

Engineers at Inmarsat PLC, whose satellite picked up the pings, plotted seven positions for the jet on 8 March, Chris McLaughlin, a company spokesman, said in an interview. “The plane flew steadily away from the satellite over the equator while pinging,” McLaughlin said. The data helped investigators conclude that the most logical path was progressively either north or south, with the bulk of search efforts focused on the south.

“I hope that we’ll find the time soon when we’re able to conclusively say once and for all that we are close to finding where this plane may now be located, and that there can be some kind of closure for families,” Australia’s deputy prime minister Warren Truss told reporters on Sunday. “We will continue as long as there’s hope.” Bloomberg###1933||###1934||Empty###1935||Empty###1936||Why did this happen?

The company, however, did not disclose the reasons for the move.

"This appointment follows the termination of as the company's president and CEO and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors," said in a statement.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, it added.

Bennett was roped in to head the US-based firm in July 2012 when its then President and CEO Enrique Salem was asked to leave the company after a 19 year association with Symantec, including three years as the CEO.

"It was the board's judgement that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO," Symantec had said.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation.

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

He will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its compensation and leadership development committee or nominating and governance committee.

Board member Robert S Miller will replace Brown as the chair of the compensation and leadership development committee.###1940||Representatives from the European Parliament and EU governments were reported to have reached a preliminary deal Thursday on what's meant to be another crucial element of the bloc's banking union to emerge in heeding a lesson form the global financial crisis.

After 16 hours of talks in Brussels, negotiators said there had been a breakthrough, but details were not immediately available with the heads of the political factions in parliament overwhelmingly supporting the deal.

The EU's Market Commissioner, Michel Barnier, said the bank-wind down scheme "might not be a perfect construction" but would help to "put an end to the era of massive bailouts."

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble described the compromise as a mechanism to effectively control rescue funding and to minimize the risk to taxpayers. Schäuble also said that the participation of stakeholders in a bank rescue, known as bail-in, as well as completion of a bank rescue fund within 8 rather than 10 years were the most important issues.

Clear-cut modalities of how to wind down failing banks had been seen as a vital contribution to shielding taxpayers from the financial consequences of lenders' bailouts in future and an important instrument to restore trust in the single-currency system.

Who will foot the bill?

A major bone of contention had been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to pay how much into a joint pot to pay for any winding-down procedures. The common fund was expected to swell to 55 billion euros ($76 billion) within the next eight years.

Negotiators had been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May or else risk delaying the matter until 2015. The final opportunity for parliament to approve any accord is at its three-day session starting April 14.

A common bank wind-down mechanism is widely considered as important as the upcoming banking supervision by the European Central Bank (ECB) from November of this year, following a thorough check of the eurozone lenders' health and core capital.

hg/kms (dpa, AFP)###1941||Empty###1942||Today, The Wall Street Journal reports that Citi Bike is in need of funds, due in part to a “number of costly issues, including damage to equipment during superstorm Sandy, software glitches and a difficult 2013-14 winter that discouraged ridership.”

Unlike most other U.S. bike sharing systems, Citi Bike is entirely privately funded with sponsorships from Citi Bank ($41 million) and Mastercard ($6.5 million), along with financing from Goldman Sachs. This limited funding pool means that any other funding needs fall on riders. Raising user fees to cover costs — which is similar to raising fares for transit systems — increases the user’s burden, is not a sustainable source of revenue and, of course, makes it even more difficult for low- and middle-income riders to access the system.

TSTC took a look at three other programs – Washington D.C.’s Capital Bike Share, Boston’s Hubway and the Twin Cities’ Nice Ride – to see how these programs raise funds for capital and operating expenses and what New York City can learn from how these systems are funded. And while farebox recovery rates for each system tend to be high (according to most recent figures available: Capital Bikeshare generated 97 percent; Hubway, 88 percent; and Nice Ride, 62 percent), funding comes from numerous sources.

Public-Private Partnerships

Capital Bike Share and Hubway, which are both public-private partnerships, receive capital and operating funds from a combination of federal and state grants, local contributions and corporate sponsors (in addition to user fees). Hubway received capital and operating funds for the first three years of operation through federal CMAQ and FTA grants, and a contribution from the Boston Public Health Commission, on top of corporate sponsorships and user fees. Capital Bike Share similarly receives CMAQ funding, as well as state, county and city contributions. Their latest system expansion (20 new stations and 200 bikes in Montgomery County, Maryland) was funded by a federal grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board. Hubway and Capital Bikeshare both receive funding from local universities and hospitals as well.

Non-Profit Organizations

Nice Ride receives operating and capital funding from local and federal grants, private foundations, and for-profit companies. According to the organization’s 2012 Annual Report and 2013 Mid-Season Update, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Bike Walk Twin Cities (funded through the Federal Highway Administration) comprise 71 percent of the organization’s 2010-2013 expansion funds. From 2010 to 2012 (the report lacks complete operating expenses and funding data for 2013), contributions from station sponsors, which include local institutions, businesses, private firms, corporations, co-ops and the City of Minneapolis Public Works/ABS Ramps and MPLS Parking, accounted for 40 percent of the system’s operating costs during this period.

The Case for Public Funding

ITDP’s The Bike-Share Planning Guide makes the case that bike share programs should be thought of as part of a greater public transportation system and should be funded as such:

Government funding for capital costs and operations makes sense in light of the fact that bike-share is part of the larger public transport network, and when all internal and external costs and benefits are considered, it is probable that bike-share will have a lower per person cost than any other public transport option.

Other public transportation systems in New York City receive federal, state and city funding. New York City’s East River Ferries received $9.3 million over three years from the City, despite having a daily ridership a fraction of Citi Bike’s. And, as the charts below make clear, the MTA’s buses, subways and rail also receives a combination of funds to pay for operating and capital costs.

System Fare Revenues Local Funds State Funds Federal Assistance Other Funds LIRR – 45% 5% 50% 0% MNR – 64% 1% 35% 0% NYCT – 15% 1% 35% 48%

With over 5 million trips in the first eight months, a recent survey that shows 91 percent of Citi Bikers would like to see the system expand, and calls from outer boroughs to bring Citi Bike to their neighborhoods, it’s clear that New York City loves its bike share. It’s also clear that if Citi Bike is to meet this demand, the financial burden for expansion cannot fall solely on its riders. Regardless of the source, a broadened funding base is key for Citi Bike to expand into transit-starved neighborhoods while keeping bike share affordable.###1943||MtGox, the major Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, has said in a statement that they have found 200,000 of their missing bitcoins.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said Monday that the settlement for economic loss following certain recalls in 2009 and 2010 does not impact ongoing litigation for personal injury or wrongful death claims related to alleged unintended acceleration.

"It's a relief to know that Toyota is offering substantial benefits to a very large number of Canadian consumers in order to resolve these actions. I think that this is a fair settlement for Toyota owners across the country," said Steven Hamilton, the representative plaintiff for members of the Ontario class.

The settlement — approved by courts in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan — provides class members with a customer support program for a minimum of three years and up to 10 years to cover all parts and labour costs for certain vehicle components.###1952||Empty###1953||_iNVEZZ.com: Monday, March 18th:_ The Center for European Economic Research ZEW today released its Indicators of Economic Sentiment for Germany and the Eurozone, the prints for both of which showed larger-than-expected declines this month.

The German measure fell to a six-month low of 46.6 from February’s 55.7, whereas analysts had been expecting a drop to 52.8. A reading above zero indicates optimism.

“In this month’s survey the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts’ economic expectations for Germany,” observes ZEW president Prof. Dr. Clemens Fuest. “Nevertheless, the indicator’s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

ABN Amro Bank economist Aline Schuiling notes that “despite its decline, the ZEW indicator remains well above its long-term average value and at a level consistent with strong growth of the German economy”.

The measure of expert assessment of the current economic situation in Germany climbed 1.3 points to 51.3 points, ZEW reported.

Investor confidence “has been near record levels, and it could have reached a cyclical high,” notes Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet. “It would suggest that the German economy may find it difficult to re-accelerate from here, especially if foreign demand continues to slow down.”

Separately, ZEW’s Eurozone Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell to its lowest reading since December at 61.5 points, down from 68.5 in February and grossly undershooting expectations for 67.3.

The current economic situation indicator climbed 3.5 points to negative 36.7.

In trading so far today, the EUR/GBP has reached its highest point since 27 December at 0.8388, rising for a third consecutive trading day. At press time, the pair is changing hands at 08382, up 0.15 percent from the day’s opening price.

The price action is close to its descending 200-day simple moving average, currently positioned at 0.8394 and which may provide resistance.

One of the leaders in this budding technology is Bitcoin, a form of electronic money created in 2009. Its currency depends on a network of computers that deal with complicated mathematical problems to form and record the details of each bitcoin transaction, according to an article by Reuters, an international news website.

Bitcoins are created by “mining,” according to the Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin miners use specialized hardware to process transactions and secure the network, which then rewards the network with a certain number of new bitcoins and money collected from a transaction fee.

James Dow, CSUN professor from the department of finance, said it is difficult to use bitcoins because the process is complicated.

“Using bitcoins requires a certain number of computer expertises, while using regular money — anybody on the street can do that,” Dow said.

Bitcoins are kept in a “digital wallet,” a type of virtual bank account permitting people to send or receive bitcoins, purchase goods or save their money, all free from the government’s control and central banks’ intervention, according to a CNN Money article about the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin’s value lies not in physical properties and central authorities, but people’s confidence and their willing to accept them as payment, according to the Bitcoin Foundation.

Several online retailers like Overstock.com and TigerDirect have already started accepting bitcoins, but its adoption is not common, according to the Reuters’ article.

Francesco Giartosio, CEO of GlassUp, smart eyeglass store that deals in bitcoins, said the main purpose of his company accepting bitcoins as an alternative payment is to test customers’ reactions.

“It is an experiment to see if it attracts interest from people who want to spend bitcoins,” Giartosio said.“I would say the experiment has failed because we have sold only one unit.”

On Feb. 25, Mt. Gox, an industry leader in bitcoin exchange, where people can purchase or sell bitcoins under different currencies, shut down its site and closed all transactions, sparking off a host of prospective investors’ anxiety and wavering their confidence in the digital currency, according to an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Mt. Gox users might have lost more than $300 million worth of bitcoins, which was the latest and biggest failure in the virtual currency.

Giartosio said the closure of a bitcoin exchange company was not an isolated incident, and it would happen again in all likelihood.

“Fortunately, our account at Mt. Gox was empty,” Giartosio said. “It would be wise for people to keep little money in bitcoins.”

Dennis Halcoussis, CSUN professor of economics, said the incident at Mt. Gox had a great impact on bitcoin customers and investors.

“Bitcoin has a problem now because people will not feel confident about its future,” Halcoussis said.

Dow said the incident illustrates that the monetary system relies on a number of different institutions to build confidence and support it.

“A new digital currency might not have those institutions to establish, which makes more speculative and risky,” Dow said.

Marin Dajak, co-founder of www.btcgate.com, an online electronics store that accepts bitcoins, said he doesn’t expect a large number of companies to suffer the same fate as Mt. Gox.

“There is a large number of scammers and hackers out there praying on businesses and users, and while this is bad in the end, it will help strengthen the bitcoin economy,” Dajak said. “I believe the incident of Mt. Gox is a good thing, and it will help bring forward a better, more transparent exchange like Bitstamp.”

Dajak added that the main problem with Mt.Gox was poor customer support and lack of transparency and security.

“While Mt.Gox was extremely important in the beginning phases of bitcoins, it simply did not keep up with its potential and grew too big and too fast,” Dajak said.

Claudio Levrini, manager of Bitroad, a bitcoin exchange company selling electronics, said while bitcoin exchange companies take advantages of the digital currency, it is also their duty to make wise decisions an d take security measures.

“Mt. Gox was on the brink of bankruptcy from November last year, and it was known in the community,” Levrini said. “You are responsible to keep your money safe.”

Dajak said the companies that take special precautions regarding security will survive and grow.

Nancy Virts, professor of economics at CSUN, said there are no reasons for merchants to accept bitcoins because it is a very risky investment.

“Money has no intrinsic values, not like gold and coins,” Virts said. “Money is not useful unless people are willing to accept them in payment.”

Virts pointed out that bitcoins are not accepted worldwide partly due to lack of the United States government’s support.

“The advantage of dollar bills is that the US government is willing to accept in payment for taxes, and as a result, businesses are willing to accept in payment not just in the US, but all around the world,” Virts said.

Halcoussis said a currency’s stability comes from the level of people’s confidence rather than the government.

“The dollar is relatively stable because people believe that the U.S. government is stable and the dollar will continue to have value for a long time,” Halcoussis said. “A currency doesn’t have to have a government backing it, but people have to believe it will continue to have value in the future.”

Bitcoin transactions are instant, and its users do not need to have a bank account and disclose their own personal data to third party, Levrini said.

Dajak said there are a variety of advantages of using bitcoins because they are decentralized.

“We are firm believers in bitcoin, and we use it both personally and have decided to use it on our site exclusively to help make it the future of money,” Dajak said. “An added benefit is bringing down processing costs and in turn, offering the lowest possible prices for our customers.”

Dow said the biggest advantages of bitcoins are anonymity and the avoidance of government regulation, which would make it more useful for illegal transactions.

Levrini said the future of bitcoin exchange companies will become more competitive.

“Bitcoin companies are starting to evolve, and some will grow, while others will fall,” Levrini said. “This process will hopefully create a competitive market and push many serious players to participate.”

Levrini said many people are only concerned about bitcoin itself, while the true innovation is the “blockchain” concept, which synchronizes transactions between the digital currency record transactions.

The Bitcoin network depends on the “blockchain,” an electronic ledger that keeps all confirmed transactions of a specific amount of currency from one person to another, according to a blog about bitcoins. Once these transactions spread on the bitcoin network, they will be synchronized and updated on every participant’s computer.

“We accept bitcoin because we believe that this technology will redefine ecommerce and retail payments,” Levrini said. “The blockchain is an innovation that will change many aspect of the financial world forever, and the bitcoin is just the beginning.”

Levrini added that failures are inevitable, but they will be the evolution of new technology.

“Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg, and we will see many different applications coming from this technology,” he said. “In years to come we will see how big the impact of this innovation will be and what road will the progress take.”

Giartosio said the bitcoins will evolve into other forms of digital money in the future.

“Some bigger projects will replace bitcoins if they do not make partnerships with other countries,” he said. “Like Facebook has replaced MySpace, and Android is replacing iOS.”###1957||Empty###1958||Goshen, IN (46526)

Results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks’ financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year’s tests.

“The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago,” said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment – now at 6.7 percent – would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests – even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks’ progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.###1963||Choose the plan that’s right for you.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###1965||Democratic members of the Congress have issued a letter to the makers of a drug used to cure hepatitis C to question its very expensive price.

The letter was sent by Henry Waxman of California, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and Diana DeGette of Colorado. It was addressed to Gilead Sciences, the maker of the drug referred to as Sovaldi.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the congressmen wrote in their letter, as reported by the New York Times.

On the other hand, Gilead Sciences explained that the price for Sovaldi is the fairest price that they could offer for the drug. The company’s executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, Gregg Alton, expressed that they are willing to meet with the members of the Congress to settle the issue.

“We think the price is fair,” he said in an interview with the N.Y Times. “It will save the system money long term.”

It is estimated that three to four million Americans are suffering from hepatitis C. If left untreated, it could lead to more serious infections such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Sovaldi was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2013 and could cure 80 percent of hepatitis C cases in a matter of 12 weeks. This is a higher cure rate using the least amount of time possible. Treatment using Sovaldi was also noted to induce the least cases of side effects.

However, insurers argue that a 12-week treatment with Sovaldi can cost $1000 a pill, and this is very expensive.

“It’s unprecedented that we have a drug that is this expensive that this many patients can benefit from,” Dr. Steve Miller told N.Y Times. Miller is the chief medical officer for Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefits manager. “You have a drug that has the potential to break a lot of the payers.”###1966||Democratic members of the Congress have issued a letter to the makers of a drug used to cure hepatitis C to question its very expensive price.

Reuters

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, +2.09% TM, -0.04% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota’s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn’t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.

Gox says it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins still remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company says in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said about 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.###1976||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

It's another fun day for biotech stocks, as my colleague Brendan Conway has pointed out, thanks to a letter from three Democrats to GileadSciences (GILD), which raises pricing concerns about Sovaldi.

That news has dragged down the entire biotech sectors, with Gilead falling 3.4% to $72.97 at 11:41 a.m. today, Amgen (AMGN) dropping 1.9% to $124.60, Celgene (CELG) declining 2.2% to $146.74, Biogen Idec (BIIB) dropping 4.5% to $331.61 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) falling 5.4% to $164.21.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that three per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: “After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of “We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit.”

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the “exciting project”, adding: “The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

“It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

“We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.”

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: “Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: “The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.”

WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and other banks will find out if the Federal Reserve thinks they can cope with the next financial crisis when it publishes the results of an annual health check on Thursday.

If the Fed finds that any of the 30 banks subject to the so-called stress tests are still at risk, the banks will then have a few days to change any plans they may have made to return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buy-backs.

Most banks are expected to pass the exam, but analysts will closely watch the results. Last year, American Express lowered its capital distribution proposal after the first submission.

And banks may have been more willing to take risks with their initial plans this year, now that they have been building up capital in the years since the crisis.

“These banks are very well capitalized and I know they’re going to want to get more aggressive each incremental year in terms of what they ask for,” said Fred Cannon, global director of research for Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.

The annual testing has become an increasingly important tool for regulators to ensure that banks are not eating too much into their capital cushions, by examining how banks would weather a hypothetical major market shock.

Analysts said the biggest U.S. banks will probably meet the Fed’s requirements, having reduced their leverage, the amount of debt compared to shareholder equity, since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Bigger fireworks could come next week, when the Fed will either approve or reject each firm’s plans to pay dividends to shareholders or buy back shares.

The Fed conducts stress tests each year to measure how banks’ loan books and security portfolios would hold up under extreme economic scenarios not unlike those experienced during the last crisis.

Thirty banks participated in this set of tests, up from 18 last year.

The first chunk of results is meant to show banks’ relative strength if each firm made the same capital moves. The Fed assumed each bank would pay dividends equal to the average of the past four quarters, and buy back no shares.

Last year, only Ally Financial failed to meet the minimum 5 percent capital buffer in the first round of the tests.

In a new hurdle imposed this year, the biggest eight banks had to consider what would happen to their business if their largest trading counterparty were to default.

The Fed will make its own projections for bank balance sheets this year, and banks may release results of their internal stress tests if they disagree. (Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by David Gregorio)###1982||###1983||Privacy Policy (Updated: 5/18/18)

DATE LAST MODIFIED: May 18, 2018###1984||New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has called for tough regulations to tackle practices such as co-location, which he claims give high-frequency traders unfair advantages and distort the market.

Schneiderman - who has been investigating HFT practices as part of an 'insider trading 2.0' campaign - has homed in on services offered by trading venues that benefit HFT firms at the expense of other market participants.



Speaking at a symposium in New York, the attorney general highlighted the practice of allowing traders to locate their computer servers within trading venues; providing extra network bandwidth to high-frequency traders; and attaching ultra-fast connection cables and special high-speed switches to their servers.



All of these practices are designed to give clients millisecond advantages, enabling them to make trades, often risk-free, before the market has time to react.



Co-location arrangements also help HFT firms to continuously monitor all the exchanges for large incoming orders. If a firm can detect a large order from an institutional investor - like a pension fund - it can instantaneously position itself on the other side of the trade, driving up the prices artificially.



This, in turn, forces big investors into adopting complicated and expensive defensive strategies like fleeing to dark pools to conceal orders from "parasitic traders", says Schneiderman.



The attorney general is calling on exchanges and regulators to look into changes that would see orders processed in batches rather than continuously to ensure that price rather than technology-driven speed decides who obtains a trade.



"Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets are becoming too focused on catering to them...It's long past time that we focus on structural reforms to help eliminate the unfair advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders," says Schneiderman.



The attorney general has already had some success in his crusade against HFT. Last July, under pressure from him, Thomson Reuters agreed to suspend its practice of providing traders with consumer survey results a couple of seconds before the information was given to other subscribers.



Since then, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has agreed to end its practice of systematically surveying Wall Street analysts for their sentiments on firms it covers in order to obtain advance information.###1985||

[dropcap]R[/dropcap]epublicans in the Colorado legislature looking to rail against Obamacare this election season will relish a statistical advantage.

They’ve asked the state’s division of insurance to deliver a letter every month reporting the number of health-insurance policies canceled in the state due to the Affordable Care Act. So, new figures will come at a regular clip from now until Election Day.

But the division is quick to note that the statistics the Republican lawmakers are seeking tell only one side of the politically charged story of Obamacare in Colorado. What’s more, officials say, there’s no easy remedy to the problem of imbalance because the division doesn’t collect the kind of statistics that would paint a more complete picture of how the law is working.

The letter the Division sent Monday to the Senate — the first of many to come — detailed that 1,755 policies serving Colorado consumers in the individual-plan market had been canceled over roughly the last 30 days. Those cancelled policies come in addition to the 335,486 plans canceled between October and the end of February.

The numbers sound bad – perfect fodder for stump speeches and political attack ads aimed at Democrats who support Obamacare. But there’s a difference between how the figures sound and what they represent. Division of Insurance Spokesman Vince Plymell says canceled policies don’t translate directly as lost insurance coverage.

“We only have the statistics on the cancellations,” he said. “We’re not a research institute. We don’t measure how people proceed when they find out a policy has been canceled — if they go to new carriers or onto the exchange. We don’t know. We don’t have statistics on how many people are insured or uninsured or whether that number is rising or falling.

“What we do know is that people have more options now than they did before and that they can’t be denied insurance, which is really a good thing.”

The division has been grappling with the charged politics of policy cancellation numbers for months. When the office first started publishing the growing numbers of cancellations in the state, staffers for Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Udall complained that the figures were unbalanced by the fact that insurance companies were offering alternative plans for renewal. Republicans seized on those complaints to suggest Udall was trying to intimidate division employees for political reasons. The flap led to several rounds of news stories and ended when insurance division officials wrote letters and testified that what lawmakers were calling intimidation was more accurately described as the kind of spirited exchange on the content and quality of its work that the division welcomed.

“A fact finding review revealed no evidence of any intimidation and the ‘level of coercion by Senator Udall and/or his staff’ was zero,” wrote Barbara Kelley, director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies in response to a letter of inquiry from Republican state Rep. Amy Stephens. “There was a disagreement among staff about how to characterize the data. However, the situation was neither received, nor acted upon as coercive or intimidating.”

Insurance plans being canceled in Colorado and around the country don’t meet basic product standards introduced by the Affordable Care Act. Just as car manufacturers can no longer sell vehicles without seat belts or with gas tanks apt to explode in a collision, insurance companies now must sell policies that, for example, cover preexisting conditions, offer low-cost preventative care and contain no caps on coverage that leave in the lurch consumers who run up repeat high charges because they have the great misfortune, for example, of getting in a car wreck and then suffering cancer and later multiple sclerosis.

Indeed, the cancellation numbers are being interpreted as bad and good, depending on your view of the system and your politics. Republican lawmakers see the cancellations as a sign of unnecessary disruption and government overreach. Consumer-rights groups see them as damning evidence that many companies for years have been making a great deal of money selling deeply flawed and overpriced insurance plans.

Plymell said the transition this year to the new market being shaped by the Affordable Care Act is bumpy, but that the law already is expanding consumer choice and increasing coverage.

“The fact is, people prefer to do nothing. It’s human nature. They want to stick with what they got, and the law says insurance companies can’t just map people over to a new plan that the insurance companies think is best. So, people have to do something. But now they can really shop around and they can not be denied if they have preexisting conditions. A lot of people will find better plans than the ones that were canceled,” he said.

Ben Davis, a spokesman for the state’s “Obamacare” insurance exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, said it will be very hard to know with certainty how many people who received cancellation letters signed onto new plans directly with their original providers or other insurance companies.

“Anyway, that’s not what we do,” he said. “We’re not tracking those numbers.”

Like Plymell at the insurance division, Davis says that statistics about large populations – such as all of Colorado’s health-insurance consumers — take years to compile.

Davis said that what Connect for Health can and does carefully track is how many people have signed up for coverage on the state’s healthcare exchange.

From October 1, 2013, and March 17, 2014, more than 250,000 Coloradans enrolled through Connect for Health.

The deadline for signing up is in ten days – on March 31.

Tax fines for not signing up for health coverage this year will be substantial and they will grow every year. A fine calculator is available here. If you make $30,000 per year, you will have to pay a $199 fine for not buying health insurance this year, $412 next year and $695 in 2016. If you make $70,000 per year, you will have to pay a $599 fine this year, $1,236 next year and $1,593 in 2016.###1986||Silicon Republic Cookies Policy

The hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #Turkey blockedTwitter became the top trending topics globally on Friday, just hours after the Turkish government imposed the ban.

The number of tweets from Turkey reportedly rose by 138 percent as savvy Internet users, including the country's president Abdullah Gul, found it easy to circumvent the shutdown.

"The whole world is laughing at you #ErdoganBlockedTwitter," users tweeted, as dozens of images mocking the ban - including one showing Twitter birds covering Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's head in droppings - were shared on the platform.

Another popular tweet shared a poster of the prime minister on a Barack Obama campaign poster with the message, "Yes, we ban".

Erdogan on Thursday night promised to "root out" and wipe out" the social media platform after users published claims of corruption against him.

Leaked recordings shared and linked on Twitter include one in which Erdogan allegedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police corruption probe.

Erdogan insists the recordings are fabricated "vile fakes" and part of a plot to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 election.

On Friday, Twitter users were forwarded a statement by twitter.com from Turkey's telecoms regulator, TIB, which cited court orders for the site's apparent closure.

Workarounds

Twitter also posted a message instructing Turkish users on how to continue using the service via SMS text message.

Many of the country's estimated 12 million Twitter users shared instructions on other workarounds for the ban, including the use of a virtual private network, or VPN, that hides the origin of tweets.

The ban was denounced as censorship throughout Turkey, including by President Gul, who tweeted that "the shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable".

"Besides, as I have said many times before it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely," Gul tweeted to his four million-plus followers.

The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gokcek, became the first member of Erdogan's own Justice and Development party to breach the ban. "I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it," he tweeted.

In response to the shutdown, Turkey's main opposition party, Republican People's Party, announced it would file a legal challenge to the court order.

The closure was also criticised globally, with the vice-president of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes, tweeting that the ban was "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

"Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is," Kroes said.###1990||Empty###1991||Empty###1992||MAINTENANCE Sory This Site Not Available

The information stolen included payment card numbers and the three-digit security codes, known as CVV numbers, the company said. The retailer said it does not store customers’ personal identification numbers (PINs).

Customers will be notified if their information was stolen, said Sally Beauty, which is advising shoppers to check their bank statements for suspicious transactions. The company did not provide details on the nature of the breach, including whether it affected only shoppers who came into a store or also those who shopped online.

The confirmation follows a statement by Sally Beauty this month that said it detected a breach Feb. 24 but had no evidence that customers’ data had been stolen. The breach was first reported by security blogger Brian Krebs.

Krebs wrote that Sally Beauty probably had been attacked by the same hackers who stole more than 100 million customers’ data from Target.

Sally Beauty said that it was working with Verizon Enterprise Solutions and the Secret Service to investigate the breach.

“As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation,” the company said in a statement. “As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.”

A spokeswoman for Verizon Enterprise Solutions confirmed that the company was investigating the breach but did not provide details.

The attack makes Sally Beauty the latest retailer in the crosshairs of hackers. In addition to Target, Neiman Marcus and Michaels also suffered data breaches last year. The attacks have sparked debates in Washington on updating the nation’s breach notification laws and its payment systems.

Sally Beauty sells and distributes professional products in more than 2,700 stores across the country. The Texas-based company has $3.6 billion in annual revenue.###1995||There’s a reason that the administrators of Obamacare haven’t revealed how many people who have enrolled were previously uninsured: They don’t know.

Enrollees in the federal exchange and most of the 15 state exchanges are not asked if they had insurance before signing up, CNBC reports.

“All applicants who are seeking subsidies must answer questions about future access to insurance, but they are not asked about prior or current coverage,” the network reports on its website.

CNBC surveyed the state exchanges and 12 of the 15 replied. Of those, only Kentucky and New York ask applicants if they previously had insurance.

Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it should have been obvious that whether those signing up are uninsured would be a common question.

"A lot of people could have anticipated this is a question everyone would be asking," she said. But it’s still understandable that the information isn’t being collected as program administrators single focus is on signing people up before the March 31 enrollment deadline, not conducting research or an evaluation, she told the network.



###1996||Empty###1997||Empty###1998||Did Wal-Mart just put GameStop out of business? That's the question buzzing around Tuesday morning on the heels of news that the superstore chain is re-starting its video game trade-in program, a move that positions the retailer to take a huge bite out of GameStop's core business strategy. As a result of the speculation, shares of GameStop are down about 6% in early morning trading.

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday morning that starting March 26, customers will be able to trade in their old video games in exchange for gift cards that can be used towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, in stores or online. Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide and accepting games used on consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360, the move marks a direct threat to GameStop, whose 6,488 stores do significant business in the pre-owned video game category. In its third fiscal quarter in January, GameStop said it saw pre-owned sales increase 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, or 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also said in January that gross margins for the pre-owned category are expected to range from 46% to 49% for both its fourth quarter and its full fiscal year.

Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S, acknowledged that the company is "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," saying that gaming is important category to Wal-Mart. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,” Mac Naughton said in a statement Tuesday morning.

It's worth noting that this is Wal-Mart's second attempt at entering the pre-owned video game market; in 2009, the superstore chain introduced kiosks that customers could use to trade in their old video games, but the program failed to work and was suspended in 2010. More recently the retailer was quietly accepting trade-ins online, but in partnering with CE Exchange, the company behind Wal-Mart's tablet and smartphone trade-in program, Wal-Mart is clearly hoping this newest attempt at capturing the pre-owned video game market will be more successful.

It remains to be seen if Wal-Mart's new program is appealing to hard-core gamers, who often trade in old games just to buy new ones -- and not things like clothes or sports equipment or other Wal-Mart products. If enough video game customers aren't interested in Walmart or Sam's Club dollars, GameStop could very well emerge from this test unscathed.

Following Wal-Mart's announcement, shares of GameStop initially sank more than 7% in Tuesday's pre-market trading session; the stock is currently down about 6.3%. Year-to-date, the video game retailer has trailed the market, posting a near-20% decline for 2014 thus far. It finished 2013 trading with a 92% return. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, was relatively unmoved in Tuesday's pre-market trading: the stock is currently down just .08%. Year-to-date, the superstore is down 5.4%.###1999||TORONTO – Prime Minister Stephen Harper imposed economic sanctions and travel bans Friday against 14 additional Russian officials.

Harper also issued an economic sanction against Bank Rossiya, a financial institution that serves as the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation following the “so-called” referendum that annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

“Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty,” he said in a statement.

The Russian officials include Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, aide to President of the Russian Federation, Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the security council of the Russian Federation, as well as various military and foreign policy advisors.

Harper left for a trip to Ukraine Friday morning to meet with that country’s prime minister and show support for Ukrainians during the Russian incursion into the Crimean peninsula.

The brief trip to Ukraine comes a few days before Harper is expected to make the case for a tough, united G7 front against the Russians.

Vermont's unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average - the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state's unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers - the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

"The January numbers start the year on a positive note," Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. "Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth."

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February's report is due out in late March.

One of Vermont's economic challenges is the size of the work force. With the exception of January's preliminary numbers, the labor force has dipped in recent years after decades of solid growth.

Moody's Investors Service named the downward trend in job growth as one of Vermont's primary credit challenges in its October 2013 assessment of the state's credit rating. The state's rapidly aging population - a major factor in the overall labor trends - also topped the list of negative credit factors.

The ratings agency's sister company, Moody's Analytics, credits the tourism and food processing industries with helping to keep the state's economy afloat in the short-term.

Seasonally adjusted state data show a 6.8 percent increase in leisure and hospitality jobs since January 2013: the arts, entertainment and recreation sector gained about 600 jobs. Accommodations and food services filled about 800 positions. Food manufacturing is also up.

Durable goods manufacturing led the seasonally adjusted declines in 2013, shedding 6.5 percent, or 1,400 jobs. Construction is also down, by about 2.1 percent, or 300 jobs, since last January.###2001||Empty###2002||Empty###2003||This will appear next to all of your comments

Pending approval, the dodecagonal prism will replace the current cylindrical design, and will feature a number of security measures to prevent counterfeiting. The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Thanks, Trevor!###2007||Empty###2008||Empty###2009||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) have taken a beating since the start of the year.

The stock is down 4% for three months, nearly 5% for the year to date and 7% since the beginning of December. Shares are currently at $74.75.

Even less attractive have been the images presented to TheStreet's readers by Rocco Pendola.

Walmart may not be able to exchange its image at the moment, but on Tuesday it announced you can now come in and exchange your used video games. This is a $2 billion industry that is currently dominated by, among others, GameStop (GME).



WATCH: Jim Cramer Prefers Take-Two, EA to Walmart and GameStop

Beginning March 26, Walmart customers may bring in used video games from popular consoles like Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox 360 and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation3. Customers will receive a store credit, which can be used at Walmart and Sam's Club stores.

Unlike similar trade-in programs, Walmart won't offer cash for the exchange at more than 3,100 stores, but customers can use the credit towards online Walmart purchases such as mobile devices. Walmart also plans to send those games traded in off for refurbishing and sold "like new."

If this sounds like a pawn shop, it's because pawn shops operate under a similar models. Blockbuster also tried this trade-in tactic and it failed. Both Amazon (AMZN) and Target (TGT) have begun playing this game.

But given Walmart's dominance across the U.S., there is a strong market for what the company might be able to produce, which will help revenue.

There may be an element of "so what" here. But before you knock this idea, consider that Wal-Mart posted $11.9 billion in revenue for all of 2013. The pre-owned gaming market is said to be a $2 billion industry, which represents 16% of Wal-Mart's annual revenue.

###2010||The Royal Mint is taking on the counterfeiters by replacing the humble £1 coin – but businesses say there is a flipside

In today's budget, the UK Chancellor, George Osborne, will announce the replacement of the £1 coin from 2017 amid concerns about the current design's vulnerability to counterfeiting.

The new coin will be based on the threepenny bit that disappeared from circulation after decimalisation in the 1970s, with designers claiming it will be "the most secure in the world".

Why is it being changed?

The rounded £1 coin has been in use since 1983, with £1.5bn in circulation in March 2013, but ministers say the old technology used to make the coins makes it too easy for counterfeiters to copy. The new design will be in the same gold and silver colours as the euro and is particularly hard to copy. "With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," said Osborne.

How big a problem are fake coins?

The Royal Mint estimates that around 3% of the £1 coins are fake – which could mean more than £45m worth of counterfeit coins are in circulation. Individuals and companies are not allowed to pass on coins they know to be counterfeit, so ending up with fakes can be costly.

Will the new coin fit parking and vending machines?

Not as it stands, according to the Royal Mint. Andrew Mills, the head of circulation for the Mint, told the BBC it was "a likelihood" that the coin would not fit in machines designed for the existing £1. The new coin will not be accepted by many automated vending and ticket machines and may not fit in supermarket trolley or locker slots.

The change could prove expensive for firms and councils needing to alter parking meters, vending machines and shopping trolleys. When new, thicker 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 2012, town halls complained that the switch could cost them £5.5m.

Won't it be a similar size?

Yes. But the need to change machines may arise from the "metal composition" of the new coin, according to Jo Audley of the British Parking Association. "The current security elements built into machines are designed to measure the metal composition of the coin," she says. "So if they're considered conterfeit or the machine fails to read the composition correctly, they are rejected. At present, 4% of £1 coins used in parking meters are counterfeit. We need to to ascertain what metals are being used and how this recallibrates into the machine, and we don't know yet."

The cost of a change, if needed, will depend on what parts in the current machines need altering, and how this is rolled out across different parking schemes, but the association says all machines, of which there are around 100,000, could need changing. "A lot of companies are using cashless systems through mobile apps and credit card payments," said Audley.

If the machines are upgraded from a standard coin-operated machine to offering a cashless payments, this will push up the cost of upgrading, she added.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

What about businesses?

The cost is expected to mainly fall on firms operating around 400,000 machines – selling anything from train tickets to snacks – while payphones, fruit machines and supermarket trolleys will also have to be changed.

A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium welcomed the news but said: "It is important for industry that any potential change is effectively planned and managed in order to minimise hardware costs for business. The BRC will engage with both the government and the Royal Mint to support a smooth transition period."

John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "Small firms who deal with low-priced items are more likely to be affected by fake currency but we do have concerns about the extra costs of introducing a new pound coin. For example, small firms may have to pay out to replace machinery. But, there's no doubt counterfeit coins and notes can seriously damage small businesses. Not only are they worthless but a business could be prosecuted if it passes them on."

How much will the change cost?

The Royal Mint has not said how much it will cost to make the new coins, but it says £2m has so far been invested in developing the new security techniques used on the machines. Mills said 90% of the changes were likely to be straightforward, and cost around £10 to £12 per machine, and that cost of changing all the machines in the country is likely to between £15 and £20m.

However the British Parking Association says just changing parking machines could cost £50m. And, of course, there's also the cost to consumers of replacing all those trolley token keyrings.###2011||Empty###2012||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Bank of America has decreased its numbers of Symantec (SYMC), it said Friday.

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

----------------------

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates SYMANTEC CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.

SYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).

The gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.

SYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.8%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.

The move could cut costs for consumers, as prices climb ever higher for new titles. But the retail giant's entry into the business poses a serious competitive threat to leading used games vendor GameStop ( GME ), along with many mom-and-pop game shops around the U.S. Big video-game publishers are also likely grumble about more lost dollars to the second-hand market.





Walmart said early Tuesday that it will begin dealing in used video games on March 26, initially focusing on titles for the PlayStation, Xbox and Wii systems. The company says the used video-game market is worth $2 billion. It could be even more lucrative if people would sell more the 880 million old video games they have sitting around the house.

For those customers who don't normally get into a GameStop, Walmart is offering an option for those games collecting dust at home. The company says it will pay more for used games -- in the form of store credit -- and sell them for less money than competitors. Used games will sell for an average of $35.





Investors will likely be looking closely at whether GameStop, the biggest video-game seller in the country, can survive the move. The company's stock rose 2 percent Monday to close at $39.75. Investors will likely be looking closely at whether GameStop, the biggest video-game seller in the country, can survive the move. The company's stock rose 2 percent Monday to close at $39.75.





The company is already threatened by a broad industry move to online and disk-less gaming, though it does offer exclusive digital content with major game releases. You don't need to visit GameStop to play "Candy Crush Saga," for example.





Meanwhile, used games are where GameStop rakes in the cash, with a margin of nearly 50 percent, reports analysts at Trefis . GameStop is trying to diversify by also selling used tablets and smartphones.





Overall, used video-game sales make up a fraction of the industry. Last month, about 56 percent of all U.S. video game spending went to new game products. Another 35 percent went to online and mobile downloads, The NPD Group reports . Only about 9 percent went to used game sales and rentals.





How will Walmart change those numbers? And how many price-conscious customers will now leave the retailer's video-game aisles with a used disk rather than a new one? Certainly, Walmart has the power to significantly drive sales of pre-owned games, sales that to this point have been a mostly niche business.

Walmart ( WMT ) is set to start buying and selling used video games, a move that promises to send shock waves across the gaming industry.###2020||Vladimir Putin turned up more than an hour late for a speech to Russia’s business elite on Thursday. This was not an insult, however, since he is habitually late. The Russian president once made his (now deposed) Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yanukovich cool his heels for four hours while he hung out with a biker gang. In the circumstances, making some of the richest people in Russia sit around for a mere 80 minutes was practically a mark of esteem.

Putin spoke for just five minutes and did not find time to mention Ukraine, Crimea, the weakening rouble or the plunging Russian markets. Instead, he focused on a different project—“de-offshore-ization.” It is an ugly word and it sounds, if anything, even uglier in Russian, especially when Putin says it: de-offshorizatsiya. But it is one he likes, and he has been pushing it since 2008.

Story Continued Below

“Russian companies must be registered on our, on their own territory, on the territory of our country and they must have a transparent property structure. I am convinced you are also interested in this,” Putin told his crowd.

What sounds like a rather dry proposal for some changes to Russian financial regulation gained dramatic urgency just minutes later, when the White House issued sanctions against Kremlin insiders. U.S. individuals and companies were suddenly barred from doing business with some of Putin’s best friends.

The impact was immediate. Visa and Mastercard stopped servicing several Russian banks, thus blocking their clients’ ability to use ATMs. When the markets opened the next day in Moscow, shares in companies linked to people on the list plunged. Novatek, a gas company partly owned by the sanctioned Gennady Timchenko, lost 12 percent as investors piled out.

In announcing the sanctions, President Barack Obama spoke of the “costs” they would impose on Putin’s inner circle, and a senior administration official later called them “very powerful” and strongly denied they are “a mere wrist slap.”

The costs to Russia are undoubtedly severe but, as Russian businessmen scramble to get their money out of America’s reach, Putin may be secretly pleased.

Since Russia opened up in the 1990s, Russian businessmen have become adept at using the offshore banking sectors of the world to hide their wealth. In this, they are no different than Western businesses, who also park their cash places where their governments can’t get at it, but they do it on a totally different scale.

According to the most recent figures from the Russian Central Bank (for the third quarter of last year), the biggest investor in the country was Cyprus ($4.5 billion), followed by the British Virgin Islands ($2.7 billion), Luxembourg ($1.6 billion) and the isle of Jersey—all of which are generally considered to be tax havens. China, Russia’s most powerful neighbour, invested $193 million during the quarter, less than Bermuda. Germany invested $428 million, little more than half the total from the Bahamas.

This is not Bahamian money, earned by hard-working hoteliers and invested in Russia in the hope of good returns. It is Russian money, part of the vast outflow that has left the country in the last two decades, and come to rest in bank accounts around the world. Last year, $63 billion left Russia. Thanks to the post-Crimea political turbulence, financial analysts predict that 2014’s total will be double that.

This not only impoverishes Russia, it also complicates Putin’s task of bringing everything in the country within his reach—hence, his desire to de-offshore-ize it.

“The oligarchs become much more beholden to him if their money is effectively under his control. They go from being independently wealthy to ‘dependently wealthy,’” Bill Browder, who was a huge portfolio investor in Russia in Putin’s early years, but who was barred from entering the country in 2006, told me. “Going forward Putin wants them to depend on him to maintain their wealth and not have it taken away.”

Since coming to power, Putin has made it his goal to restore the Kremlin’s power: by crushing Chechnya, by cancelling elections, by controlling the media and by squashing over-mighty oligarchs who felt they could challenge him.

That’s a market value higher than some established hotel and lodging companies including Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide.

TPG Capital Management is expected to lead the funding. TPG also has an investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another dominant player in the sector known as the “sharing economy”.

Airbnb has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-up companies in the five years since it was founded by graduates from Harvard and Rhode Island School of Design.

But its business model has attracted attention from authorities.

The company is involved in a legal fight with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has subpoenaed Airbnb for information to try to determine if any of its customers are violating New York state laws.

New York state does not allow renters to sublet their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present.

And the San Francisco city attorney's office has also queried the type of short-term rentals offered by Airbnb following claims that Airbnb rentals take away supply from the rented housing and drive up rents.###2022||Empty###2023||They are, like all of the leads in the quest to find a vanished Malaysia Airlines jetliner, uncertain sightings. An object photographed by a French satellite, and reported to searchers Sunday. And something that looked like a wooden pallet, surrounded by a cluster of other objects — including some that may be tie-down straps, spotted by a single search aircraft spotted.

As the search for the missing flight 370 passes two weeks, searchers have narrowed down the area where they believe the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board could have disappeared. Now, as numerous nations train their eyes on a broad rectangle in the south Indian Ocean, they are beginning to uncover traces of something that could — but is not yet with any certainty — related to the jet.

Still, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott spoke of the "increasing hope" that searchers will find something more tangible.

If it is a pallet, for example, that could prove a key finding, since wooden pallets are used in air shipping. It could also mean nothing, since pallets are also commonly used in marine shipping.

"So it's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain," said Mike Barton, Rescue Coordination Centre chief with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, speaking on Sunday afternoon.

Still, a second aircraft sent to double-check the possible pallet found nothing Saturday, as skilled searchers confront a vast and remote search area that is stretching the world's best aviation technology to its extreme limits. The difficulty in verifying sightings — U.S. and Chinese satellites have also both located objects of interest that have not been found back by aircraft or ships — only underscores the magnitude of the job at hand. Twenty-six nations are struggling to find a missing aircraft that may have crashed into waters 2,500 kilometres south-west of Australia, among the most remote places on earth, with currents that could move floating debris as much as 150 kilometres every five days.

Flight 370 disappeared in the early morning hours of last Saturday, after deviating from its intended flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Investigators believe it was deliberately diverted, and may have continued on for seven hours flying deep into the south Indian Ocean.

On Sunday, eight aircraft — four civilian, four military — took off to search a 59,000 square kilometre area, the size of Lake Huron. The civilian planes include two Bombardier Global Express, a Gulfstream 5 and an Airbus 319, which have been put into service for their ultra long range. Most of the flying time is spent winging to and from the spot search authorities believe the aircraft is most likely to be found.

The planes are "operating at the limits of their endurance, and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area," said Mr. Barton. "That's only allowing us to get in a singular search a day, which again is spreading the search out several days."

Chinese residents make up nearly two-thirds of the people aboard the plane. Their families have grown increasingly hostile toward search officials, particularly those from Malaysia who families have seen as obfuscating and creating unnecessary delays in locating relatives. On Saturday, a Beijing tense meeting between families and Malaysian officials ended early after emotions boiled over. The two sides met again Sunday, and the families set aside a time to pray.

"I am going to go crazy soon. I am very emotionally unstable," said a woman whose daughter was on board the plane, and who is now taking care of her grandchildren.

China has taken a significant role in the search, and has sent two Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft to Australia. Those planes are expected to begin flying to the search area Monday. China is also sending a cohort of warships and its icebreaker, the Xuelong; the first of those ships should begin to arrive in the area Tuesday.

More aircraft are being deployed in other areas farther north in the Indian Ocean, although significant attention is now being placed on the so-called "southern corridor," where the objects were spotted by satellites.

Weather has hampered efforts in that area, which is mid-way between Australia and Antarctica. On Sunday, searchers arrived to find sea fog and low cloud, although by afternoon that had begun to clear out. A Norwegian ship that had helped the search, the car carrier Hoegh St. Petersburg, left Saturday "in anticipation of bad weather coming through. She was worried about cargo damage, and had done three days worth of work," said John Young, general manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

The southern search area lies squarely inside the "Roaring 40s," a band of south latitude so-called by mariners because it produces fierce weather at the best of times, including winds that frequently approach gale force.

The vastness of the ocean is another complicating factor. Sun glint can obscure objects, and aircraft move so fast that "you only have to be off by a few 100 metres" to miss something, Mr. Barton said.

Still, searchers believe they are narrowing in, in part thanks to the hints provided by satellite images. "Today's search is about a visual search, a complete change of emphasis from earlier searching using radar," Mr. Barton said Sunday.

"We're into a more defined area based on the satellite imagery."###2024||Empty###2025||NEW YORK (TheStreet) --Kellogg Company (K) , the iconic cereal and snack food purveyor from Battle Creek, Mich., is winning accolades for its corporate ethics and social integrity. Shareholders and consumers are applauding and taking notice in more ways than one.

Kellogg's is a pure-play food company with a 100-year plus legacy of maintaining integrity in the way it operates its business, serves its customers, and creates value for investors. I've been following the company for the past two years and the more I've learned about it the more I like it.

For shareholders and ethical investors looking for a publicly traded company that puts its conscience in synch with its corporate objectives, Kellogg's is one of the best. In fact, once again it's been recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, an independent research center promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance. In fact, Kellogg has been recognized six times.

One example: When Kellogg was hit by a shareholder proposal filed by the Green Century Equity Fund, the company decided to commit to only purchase deforestation-free palm oil by Dec. 31, 2015. Kellogg's uses palm oil in its snack food products and came under scrutiny over its joint venture with Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil trader with a high-profile track record of controversial environmental practices.

Lucia von Reusner, Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management, confirmed via email that "By raising the bar, Kellogg's palm oil commitment should encourage other companies to step up and support the development of transparent and responsible palm oil supply chains."

An investor who aims to be socially responsible finds this kind of ethical corporate effort encouraging. Like me, you can follow Kellogg's and monitor its sustainable and environmentally sensitive practices.

The other side of my enthusiasm for Kellogg's is it's business model and products. Not only is it the world's leading cereal company, it's also the second largest producer of cookies, crackers and savory snacks and a leading North American frozen foods company.

With 2013 sales of $14.8 billion and more than 1,600 food products it's little wonder that besides General Mills (GIS), Kellogg's is one of the most popular food stocks among investors. Average daily volume is about 2 million shares and its current market cap, according to Yahoo! Finance is $22.38 billion.###2026||Canberra: Search for a missing Malaysian airliner yielded no result even more than a fortnight after it disappeared but Australian acting Prime Minister Warren Truss Sunday said the hunt will continue as long as there is hope. Search continued in the southern Indian Ocean after sightings of debris believed to be from the plane.

In its latest update Sunday night after the conclusion of the day`s search operation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said there were no sightings of significance.

Search for missing Malaysia Airlines jet: As it happened on Sunday

"The search area experienced early sea fog particularly in the western areas, however, conditions improved during the day," it said.

A total of eight aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy`s HMAS Success supported Sunday`s search effort in a cumulative 59,000 sq km search area across two search areas within the Australian Search and Rescue Region southwest of Perth.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished mysteriously about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur March 8.

The Boeing 777-200ER was initially presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast in the South China Sea. The plane was scheduled to land in Beijing at 6.30 a.m. the same day. The 227 passengers on board included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians.

Contact with the plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1.40 a.m. when it was flying over the air traffic control area of Ho Chi Minh City.

The western boundary of the multinational current search area is around 2,500 km southwest of Perth.

Four civil ultra-long range jets chartered by AMSA and four military aircraft from Australia and the US were involved in Sunday`s search together with the HMAS Success.

Twenty State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers from Western Australia were tasked as air observers Sunday on board the civil aircraft.

"Each civil aircraft had five SES air observers on board, as well as an AeroRescue Aviation Mission Coordinator. Aerorescue is AMSA`s contracted provider of dedicated search and rescue services from locations across Australia," the AMSA said in its statement.

"The search will resume tomorrow. Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft and Japanese P-3C aircraft will join the search Monday."

Earlier Sunday, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss reiterated that the search would continue in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysian airliner as long as there was hope, Xinhua reported.

"We`re hopeful obviously for breakthroughs but these kinds of searches can take a very long time especially when they`re in remote locations as is the case in this instance," Truss said in a press conference at the AMSA here.

"We hope that soon there`ll be more information available that might help provide some kind of closure or at least an understanding of what`s happened, especially to the families of those who were on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370," said Truss.

"The search will continue and will continue as long as there`s hope, and I hope that we`ll find a time soon when we`re able to conclusively say once and for all that we are close to finding where this plane may now be located," he added.

John Young, AMSA general manager of emergency response, said searchers were Sunday hoping to find again the objects spotted by airborne observers the day before so they could be recovered and to find the objects identified in American and Chinese satellite photos.

"Today is really a visual search again and visual searches take some time. They can be difficult," Young said at the press conference.

Two Chinese Ilyushin 76 aircraft had been preparing for the operation on Sunday and would take part Monday, while Chinese warships were expected to arrive in the area Tuesday, said Young.

"China clearly has an intense interest in this search operation. I believe they had 154 people on board the aircraft," he said.

Mike Barton, chief of the AMSA Rescue Coordination Centre, said four civil and four military aircraft took part in Sunday`s search.

AMSA personnel were coordinating information gained from self-locating datum buoys with expert opinions from home and abroad to identify search areas, he told the press conference.

"We put all of that information together and any new intelligence that comes to us about satellites to formulate an area and we`ll redo it again tonight based on what observations might have occurred in today`s flying and look to go out searching again and then we`ll do it again and again until we have some sort of closure or positive sightings in the area," said Barton.

Observers Saturday identified a wooden pallet, some strapping belts of different colours and "other nondescript items", he said.

The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the airline industry, he said.

"The challenge of this search hinges around its remoteness from anywhere," said Barton.

The aircraft are operating at extreme ranges from Perth, which is the closest air field, or RAAF Base Pearce, which is up the road, and so at 2,500 km away they`re operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area, and then back again," he said.

"That`s only allowing us to get in a singular search a day which is again spreading the search out over several days."###2027||This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

China Unicom, one of China's three telecom giants, has joined the 4G parade. The company made it official with an announcement on Tuesday.China Unicom will operate its 4G network services in 25 cities. The company plans to increase that to 300 by the end of this year. There is something different to China Unicom’s operating strategy since it was the last player to join the competition after China Mobile and China Telecom."China Unicom’s 4G network development has a steady strategy. We are not getting rid of the 3G network to build the 4G network. In 2014, the 3G network is still considered our main concern, while the 4G network is a supplement to hotspot areas," said Xiong Yu, General Manager, Marketing Dept., China Unicom.China Unicom’s 3G network has been upgraded in most areas to 42M. That’s already equivalent to the speed of many overseas 4G networks. China Unicom will charge for 4G and 3G service together.Moreover, China Unicom on Tuesday released about 60 terminal devices, 25 of them for the 4G network. It’s estimated that China Unicom’s terminal device sales will reach 188 million units, About 100 million of the units will support both 3G and 4G networks.

(Source: Xinhua)###2029||The Turkish prime minister has moved to silence anti-government protesters responsible for multiple demonstrations in recent weeks by blocking access to Twitter. Did he perhaps get the idea from former British Conservative MP Louise Mensch?

The decision by Islamist PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led to a fierce backlash by freedom of speech campaigners. But as Tory MP Douglas Carswell reminds us, there were similar demands from UK politicians not so long ago.

Turkish govt daft to block twitter. But do not forget that there were some folk here saying likewise after Ldn riots. — Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell) March 21, 2014

Back in 2011, when London was hit by rioting, Mensch said David Cameron should respond by closing down social media networks.

The then MP for Corby and East Northampstonshire tweeted: "Common sense. If riot info and fear is spreading by Facebook and Twitter, shut them off for an hour or two, then restore. World won't implode."

"If short, necessary and only used in an emergency, so what. We'd all survive if Twitter shut down for a short while during major riots."

The irony of using Twitter to call for Twitter to be shut down appeared to be lost on Mensch - who later went on to found her own version of Twitter called Menshn.

At the time, Cameron indicated he was prepared to look at banning people believed to be involved in organising riots from Twitter and Facebook. But he never acted on that threat.

In Turkey, Erdogan threatened to close access to Twitter in a speech on Thursday. At midnight (local time), access to the popular communication tool stopped, with PC users, confronted with a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority citing court orders, forced to use a virtual private network (VPN) to gain access to their accounts. No access was available for mobile users.

Mensch's call was for a temporary Twitter shutdown - a line echoed by Turkish president Abdullah Gul, who says he hopes his country's ban on the micro-blogging site is temporary.

The move by Erdogen comes ahead of local elections on March 30, followed by parliamentary elections, the build up to which has been dogged by allegations of fraud and corruption.###2030||Antivirus software manufacturer Symantec has terminated its Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett, the Financial Times reported.

The firing, which was effective immediately, came in the wake of a number of senior managers leaving the firm now facing lessening revenues even as the cyber security market continues to thrive. Board member Michael Brown will be replacing him for the meantime, the report said.

A source told FT that Symantec was worried about product strategy after the entire senior leadership in product development quit the firm, with some joining rival firms. Bennett took the helm in 2012 and in the course of his leadership, senior leaders and some important board members have departed the firm or have been removed. Symantec's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, President in Charge of Product and the President in Charge of Engineering and the Senior Vice-President of Worldwide Sales are not anymore with the company, FT reported.

The source told FT, "It is hard when an organisation goes through that much turnover, it loses institutional knowledge and hurts momentum. When you see that amount of turnover it might be an underlying problem with the leadership."

Symantec said it the removal of Bennett was not caused by any event or misbehavior and that it was just a part of the process the company was going through. Symantec shares had dropped 11% this year while that of its younger competitors have gone up significantly. For example, FireEye went up 54% while Palo Alto Networks went up 37%. After news of Bennett's termination was announced, after-market trading of shares of Symantec were halted, the report said.

Brown assured that Symantec has now put together a leadership team that would hasten their growth. FT quoted him as saying, "The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market."###2031||Empty###2032||A coalition of retail groups are in dismay over a decision by a federal appeals court that upheld the US Federal Reserve's cap on the amount of fees banks could charge on businesses for handling debit card transactions. The current cap is an average of $0.24 per transaction. The Houston Chronicle said that retail merchants had deemed the cap too high.

The ruling, which was issued by the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on Friday, reversed a lower court decision which was in favor of the retail groups. The retail groups reportedly sued the Fed for setting the cap, which is actually a US Congress mandate stemming from a financial regulatory overhaul in 2010. Before the overhaul, the transaction was initially set at an average of $0.44 per debit card swipe. The Chronicle noted that the Fed proposed a $0.12 transaction fee. When the transaction fee doubled when it was passed and implemented, the retail groups claimed that the federal agency had buckled under the pressure from bank lobbyists. The plaintiffs have argued that the Fed factored banks' expenses into the cap that the law had not allowed, which was a clear deviation to the intention of the 2010 overhaul.

The Chronicle said banks had been lobbying to increase the original proposed cap of the Fed and explained that the federal agency overlooked the cost of handling the debit card transactions, maintenance and fraud prevention. In late 2011, there were attempts on banks to recoup the said costs by charging their debit card customers monthly fees. Public uproar over the monthly fees led for the said banks to drop the charges, The Chronicle said.

In a statement, plaintiff the National Retail Federation said following the Appeals decision that it will be reviewing the court ruling and will mull over its decision on whether to appeal it. Senior vice president and general counsel Mallory Duncan said on behalf of the group, "NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress. The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks."###2033||Premier Inc. : Premier, Inc. named a World’s Most Ethical Company® for seventh year

The troubled exchange, which has filed for bankruptcy after a series of large thefts, had lost up to 850,000 bitcoins. This find brings the total down to 650,000.

“MtGox had certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins,” said MtGox chief executive Mark Karpeles in the bankruptcy filing, where the find was revealed.

However, “on March 7, 2014, MtGox confirmed that an old-format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 bitcoins,” he said.

The total number of bitcoins stolen equates to around 7% of all the bitcoins in existence.

NOW READ:###2035||Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, extending to medical pot the same restrictions in place for recreational pot.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don’t illegally access marijuana.

“Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids,” Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the legislature.

“Everyone came together on this,” said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

Dr. George Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency room physician at Children’s Hospital Colorado, joined the bill signing and said there’s anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said there’s not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

“We’ve only been experiencing this for a couple of years,” Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.###2036||Empty###2037||Hong Kong based sourcing specialist William E Connor & Associates has been named as one of world's most ethical companies for the third year in a row.

The accolade from US business ethics think-tank the Ethisphere Institute makes Connor is one of only a few Asia based companies to receive the award - and the only sourcing company in the world to be included on the list.

The award recognises organisations that continue to raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior, with the evaluation process covering everything from codes of ethics, litigation and business practices to the firm's impact on local communities, along with feedback from customers and employees.

Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance programme (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

"We have certainly been experiencing increased interest from clients based on their desire to be ethically compliant, which makes me very proud of what we have achieved as a business," explains Connor's chairman and CEO, William E (Chip) Connor.

Connor's success is based on a business model that enables brands, retailers and importers to source apparel and homewares from a global supply base of over 6,000 audited factories.

However, the company does not hold an equity interest in any factory, nor receive any financial benefit from factories. Instead, Connor puts together a portfolio of options providing details of different factories, prices, technical evaluations, spec packs, quality assurance and a vendor scorecard so that customers can make their own decisions. The sourcing firm's earnings are generated only from client commissions, based on the value of products delivered.

Connor also prides itself on high volume, long-term relationships with customers such as US retailer Dillards, with which it has been working for 42 years, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer (also recognised by Ethisphere), which has been a client for 17 years.

Other apparel firms included on the 2014 list of the world's most ethical companies are Gap Inc, Levi Strauss & Co and Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M).###2038||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox says it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins still remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company says in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said about 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.###2039||Empty###2040||Anti-virus software maker Corp. ( ) reached a new 52-week low today after the company said it has fired president and CEO Steve Bennett from his role, after less than two years on the job, and has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim chief, effectively immediately.

Bennett's axing follows earnings disappointments, share losses and a series of executive departures last autumn. Bennett also resigned from the board of directors.

The company said it would immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive recruitment firm.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to , including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement late Thursday announcing the news.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for 's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

Schulman said the company's priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage the company's assets and team to drive the next stage of 's growth.

He highlighted that the termination was not "precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Interim CEO Brown joined the company's board following its merger with Veritas Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive of Quantum Corp during a time when that company doubled in revenues to $6 billion.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market," said Brown in the release.

"By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage 's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

also reiterated its guidance for the fourth quarter, previously announced in January. It said it expects revenue of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, compared to $1.748 billion in the year-ago period, on adjusted earnings per share between 40 and 42 cents, down from 44 cents.

Shares of the company were lately down 12.75% to C$18.25, sinking to as low as $17.95 earlier in the session.###2041||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

I barely like having people I know in my place when I'm there, forget about trusting strangers when I'm not around. I read stories like this and it freaks me out to think just what someone might do to my place, and to my stuff.

I seem to be in the minority here, though, because the service has become incredibly popular over the last few years. It took Airbnb four years to serve its first four million guests, and then another five million in just a few months.

And now it looks to be raising a gigantic new funding round, at an astounding valuation.

The the online home-rental company is in "advanced talks" to raise a new round worth between $400 million and $500 million, according to a report out from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Private-equity firm TPG is said to be leading the round.

If true, the new round would bring the company's value to more than $10 billion. It would also more than double Airbnb's previous fundings put together.

Airbnb has raised $326 million altogether at a $2.5 billion valuation, including a $117 million Series B round from Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global and General Catalyst and, most recently, a $200 million Series C round from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst Partners, Crunchfund, Ashton Kutcher, and Founders Fund in 2012.

This latest round would bring Airbnb’s total funding to between $726 million and $826 million, and place it among the world's most valuable startups.

How much money Airbnb makes has not been divulged, but private company analyst Privco has estimated Airbnb’s 2012 revenue to be $189 million. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter forecasted at the beginning of last year that it won’t be long before Airbnb is pulling in $1 billion in revenue per year.

Since its founding in 2008, Airbnb has served more than 11 million total guests. In now operates in over 34,000 cities in 192 countries and has over 600,000 listings around the world.

Recently, the company has been looking to expand beyond ts current room rental service and into more hospitality services. In January it announced that it was piloting a cleaning service in certain zip codes of San Francisco and New York City, where hosts can arrange a cleaning of their listing prior to a guest’s check-in.

The cleanings are arranged by Handybook and Homejoy, and the cost of the cleaning service is taken from the renter's payout for the reservation.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 18 (Reuters) - Drought-plagued California will ease some protection for fish in the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, officials said Tuesday, a move expected to make more water available for farming and ease political tensions in an election year.

The move marks a retreat from restrictions imposed earlier in the year which had widely been expected to be tightened further, rather than eased, and was welcomed in the agricultural community.

"California's agriculture is critical to the world's food supply," said assemblywoman Kristin Olsen, who represents part of the San Joaquin Valley, who had lobbied hard against the restrictions. "An inability to produce that food would clearly be devastating to health and human safety not only in California but around the globe."

Citing recent rains, regulators said Tuesday there was enough water in the state's reservoirs now to partially ease restrictions.

"We were quite concerned at that time about the issue of public health and safety," Tom Howard, executive director of the state Water Resources Control Board, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. "This really had the markings of a historic drought."

The move comes after weeks of intensive lobbying from growers, lawmakers from agricultural regions and the state's two U.S. Senators, who said the restrictions, along with the possible curtailment of water rights for some agricultural and municipal customers, would harm the state's economy.

The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of a drought that may still turn out to be one of the worst in its history despite storms that brought rain and snow last week, leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water and possibly forcing farmers to leave fallow a half-million acres (202,000 hectares) of land.

Recent storms dropped nearly a foot (30 cm) of rain in some areas, boosting reservoir levels and the snowpack that the state relies on for drinking water in the spring, but still leaving supplies way below normal for this time of year.

Earlier this month, concern that the state was about to restrict water supplies to farmers even further swept through the agricultural community, spurring intensive pushback and a series of tense meetings with water regulators in the administration of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

"We are very concerned that if the current proposal as reported to us is enacted, it will have significant near- and long-term effects on the California economy and, more importantly, will not achieve the desired water supply security intended," U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jim Costa and John Garamendi, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to the water board.

CUTBACKS STILL POSSIBLE

Under the new rules announced Tuesday, which Howard said may be modified again next month, the two massive public water projects responsible for pumping in the delta will be able to deliver it to farmers and others, once the state determines that there is enough flowing to meet the health and sanitation needs of residents.

Scott Shapiro, an attorney specializing in water issues for the Sacramento firm Downey Brand, said expanding the allowable uses of tight water supplies was not just important for farmers.

"It's not just for agriculture, because there are other needs that may be contracted for that go beyond health and safety," Shapiro said. "It could include other municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.

In addition to allowing more of the water pumped from the delta to be used for purposes other than meeting health and safety needs, the state planned to reduce by about a third the amount of water that the projects were required to leave in the delta as a way of protecting fish, Howard said during the press briefing.

But he cautioned that the state could still implement severe cutbacks to the water rights of many users if dry conditions continue.

Environmental groups, long critical of what they say is over-use of the state's limited water resources for farming in dry areas, did not immediately respond to the rules change.###2045||Renewed search efforts for the Malaysian Airlines jetliner that disappeared March 8 are focusing on the South Indian Ocean, where Chinese satellite spotted a mysterious object possibly floating in the water. The object is about 74 feet long and 43 feet wide, and has been speculated might be part of the missing Boeing 777’s wings. Other debris finds, however, including one spotted by a Chinese satellite, have turned up nothing in the two-week search.

For a eurosceptic government to turn the pound coin into something that looks like a euro is, frankly, a little bit bizarre.

News of this new pound coin is far more important to ordinary people than the austerity-limited tweaks to the tax system contained in today’s Budget.

‘After 30 years’ loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin,’ declares George Osborne.

The chancellor may have succumbed to Treasury madness. It’s just a coin, not a civil servant. We must pay close attention to make sure all the old £1 coins are not given pensions.

The old circular British pound is now to be replaced by something that looks like the brainchild of a mad scientist cross-breeding a 50p and a euro. It’s a jagged two-tone affair which will be virtually impossible to roll away when you drop it on the floor in the pub. Where’s the fun in that?

Such an important decision isn’t being taken lightly. It’s actually a deliberate ploy by the Conservatives to try and appeal to Ukip-voting traditionalists. Or, as Osborne says in the press release issued by the Royal Mint:

I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit.

Personally I have no idea what the threepenny bit looks like. Nor, in all likelihood, does anyone who’s reading this on a smartphone.

But we’re not the target audience for this particular bit of politicking, are we? The Tories are desperate to win over the wrinkly vote and, as this demonstrates, are prepared to try anything to make more youthfully-challenged voters feel good.

So let’s hope, for Osborne’s sake, that the coin doesn’t get mixed up with the euro.

Tories fought to prevent Britain from having a coin like this… (Picture:: McXas/McXas)

The fuss surrounding this new design calls into question the unveiling of the London 2012 logo. That was panned for being stupid. But we all got used to it and in the end we realised how clever and cool it was.

Something tells me the designers of this new pound won’t be quite as forward-looking as those who worked on the Olympics, however.

The ‘tails’ of the coin is also up for grabs. The design for the reverse is obviously going to be critical and will be the subject of a consultation.

Perhaps if enough people asked for it we could get a cup of tea on the back of the coin? Or Big Ben? Or, dare I say it, a Star Wars light-sabre fight?

JAKARTA, March 19 — Emerging-market stocks fell for the first time in three days as Chinese developers extended declines and investors weighed prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus cuts. The yuan weakened beyond 6.20 per dollar for the first time since April.

China Vanke Co. sank 3.7 per cent in Shenzhen and Poly Real Estate Group Co. fell to a one-week low in Shanghai after the collapse of a private developer spurred concern the industry may face defaults. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. dropped to a three-month low in Mumbai after the Mint newspaper said earnings would be weak. Russia’s Micex Index retreated 0.5 per cent. The yuan lost 0.13 per cent versus the dollar.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated 0.2 per cent to 950.64 as of 2.10pm in Hong Kong. Investors are bracing for more losses for real-estate companies as lenders pull back from the industry and local governments rein in home values in the world’s second-largest economy.

The Fed is expected to cut its bond-buying programme at its two-day meeting that ends today, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The situation of Chinese developers is a concern for investors,” Laurentia Amica Darmawan, a money manager at First State Investments, said in Jakarta. “The tightening cycle globally and in China will reduce speculative activities in the industry and may cause some shocks in the short term.”

The developing-nation gauge has lost 5.1 per cent this year and trades at 10 times 12-month projected earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI World Index has advanced 0.3 per cent in 2014 and is valued at 14.7 times.

Chinese developers

China Vanke headed for its steepest drop since February 24. Poly Real Estate slid 2.5 per cent, extending its two-day loss to 5.4 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 per cent, snapping a two-day advance.

Stock traders have doubled bearish bets against some of the biggest Chinese developers amid growing concern that a weaker real-estate market will curb property sales just as borrowing costs surge.

The collapse of Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co. emerged less than two weeks after the first onshore bond default by a Chinese company. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. missed coupon payment on March 7.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong was little changed. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. jumped 8.6 per cent in Hong Kong after full-year net income surged 31 per cent.

Uni-President China Holdings Ltd. tumbled 8.1 per cent in Hong Kong, the biggest drop in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, after profit trailed estimates.

Yuan weakens

The yuan touched 6.2009 earlier, the lowest level since April 9. The spot rate has lost 1 per cent in four days. The People’s Bank of China cut the reference rate 0.02 per cent to 6.1351 against the greenback today, the weakest since December 3.

The Federal Open Market Committee will further scale back its bond-buying programme at the meeting, reducing purchases by US$10 billion (RM32.8 billion) for the third time, according to 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg March 14-17.

The Micex fell for the first time in three days. Russia cemented its claim to Crimea as President Vladimir Putin showed no sign of backing down in the standoff over Ukraine’s breakaway Black Sea region, prompting Western leaders to vow further sanctions this week. Putin signed an accord yesterday setting in motion Crimea’s accession to Russia.

Six out of 10 industry groups in the emerging-market gauge fell today, led by technology stocks. Tata Consultancy, India’s biggest software exporter, dropped 4.2 per cent, poised for the lowest close since December 16.

A third set of images, this one from a French satellite, show potential objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean that could be linked to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, which has been missing since March 8, when it disappeared from radar screens.

The images, clarified by the French ministry as satellite-generated radar echoes, or radar signals that give information about an object's location, do not seem to have been publicly released, though they were immediately sent to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is now coordinating the plane search near Perth, according to the Malaysian Ministry of Transport.

re news site. [Facts about Malaysia Flight 370]

Satellite images from both China and Australia have revealed floating objects that may be Flight 370 debris in the same area over the past week.

The Malaysian Ministry of Transport didn't provide any other details about the French image or images or the object's location, the New York Times reported.

Even so, the image or images may solidify the idea that the plane fell into the ocean off Western Australia, after radically departing from its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, according to the Times.

The new image will also be compared with the past images of possible debris. The March 16 Australian satellite images of possible debris, which were released on March 20, showed two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysian aircraft, according to the AMSA. The objects (marked by arrows in the satellite images) measure up to 79 feet (24 meters) long and 16 feet (5 m) long, respectively, according to a Reuters report. (Searches in the area have yet to turn up the floating objects.)

The more recent Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released Saturday (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The image showed a large object — about 72 feet (22 m) by 43 feet (13 m) — some 75 miles (120 km) southwest of the location of the possible debris sighted by the Australian satellite, according to SASTIND officials. (The AMSA plotted the object and though its location fell within Saturday's search area it was not sighted, the AMSA reported.)

The new French satellite photo is the latest clue in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 jet; the search effort has focused on two vast swaths of ocean, one stretching north from Malaysia toward Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and another stretching south across the Indian Ocean.

Today's search involved eight aircraft, including a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon, along with the Royal Navy's HMAS Success, covering an area of nearly 23,000 square miles (59,000 square km) across two search regions within the Australia Search and Rescue Region in the southern Indian Ocean southwest of Perth.

The search will continue Monday, with the Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft and Japanese P-3C aircraft expected to join the effort, according to the AMSA.

No? That’s pretty much the latest in the saga of embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

After having announced the alleged theft of 744,408 bitcoins—about $350 million at the time—in late February, and filed for bankruptcy in Japan, the exchange has apparently stumbled upon a forgotten stash of 199,999.99 BTC. That’s around $116 million in old-school money.

The news was announced in a filing posted on the company's site dated 20 March. The report explained Mt. Gox had happened upon the trove of bitcoins in an old wallet it thought was empty. “MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain old format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins. Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched,” the filing reads.

Mt. Gox confirmed the unexpected contents of the old wallet on March 7 and reported it to the Court, then moved it to offline wallets for security reasons . They wouldn't want to lose it again, now, would they?

While coming across an unsuspected fortune of forgotten cryptocurrency is the stuff of dreams for Bitcoiners—it’s certainly been known to happen among those who took a punt on Bitcoin early on—this discovery isn’t all cause for celebration.

On the one hand, it does make the chances of some kind of refund for those who lost money when the exchange went down look a bit more likely; there’s more in the pot. But while 200,000 BTC is a lot of money, it’s only a fraction of what was lost. As the filing states, “Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.”

And what’s perhaps most worrying about the whole scenario is the fact that Mt Gox managed to “lose” 200,000 bitcoins in the first place. It’s one thing for an individual miner to absent-mindedly chuck their personal Bitcoin wallet in a landfill, but it’s another for a company trusted to deal with other people’s money to just “forget” about a $100 million cache.

As Motherboard’s Alex Pasternack has previously written, despite all of the faith in Bitcoin’s math, trust in humans (first and foremost those running the exchanges and other Bitcoin businesses) is still essential to using the cryptocurrency. Surprises—even good ones—don’t exactly fill people with confidence when it comes to dealing with their finances.

This latest episode will only raise more questions about quite how poor record-keeping at Mt. Gox was, and will do little to raise the company’s reputation. One look at the Reddit Bitcoin community’s reactions makes it clear people aren’t exactly jumping for joy at Mt. Gox’s sudden windfall.

The details of the whole debacle are still mired in mystery right now as court proceedings continue, and this latest twist comes with a disclaimer on the initial reported loss: "Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation."

The only really good surprise for those who lost money through Mt. Gox's collapse right now would be if they got all of their bitcoins back. Unfortunately, it's still looking like that really would be a surprise.###2056||Empty###2057||Empty###2058||Empty###2059||Empty###2060||NEW YORK | Walmart Stores Inc. is hoping to shake off the winter sales doldrums with its biggest spring sales push ever.

The world's largest retailer is discounting more than 60 outdoor essentials from lawn mowers to mulch by 30 percent to 50 percent in a push that aims to take business from competitors like Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos.

The sale starts Friday and will run through March 29. Items include a seven piece-Mainstays patio furniture set for $298, $15 stacking sling chairs, $88 Kingsford charcoal grills and $144 lawnmowers from brands like Murray and Snapper.

Shoppers also can find five bags of Miracle-Gro garden soil for $10 and bags of mulch for $1.97 each. The event will be advertised in a 12-page Sunday circular.

Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said the sale was planned last summer as executives received forecasts that the winter was going to be especially harsh. But the company made changes since then because the winter was even more severe than expected.

Walmart is counting on an extra boost in sales from items like garden soil as shoppers prepare to restore their gardens and outdoor living spaces hurt by a series of winter storms.

Walmart and other retailers have seen their sales chilled by storms that caused them to close hundreds of stores and kept shoppers at home. The discounter said in February that during the height of winter storms, it had more than 200 stores closed.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Michelle Gloeckler, Walmart's senior vice president of home, described the sales event as offering Black Friday-like prices.

"I love the fact that we had a rough winter because people are going to be so ready," she said. She noted that Walmart dramatically increased the quantities of items such as mulch and other outdoor products, in anticipation of increased customer demand. She declined to offer figures.

Walmart's lawn and garden offerings, including plants, also are tailored to the climates of each region. For example, customers in southern markets such as Dallas and Atlanta will find warmer-season plants including petunias and marigolds. Shoppers in northern markets like Chicago and New York will find cold-tolerant varieties such as pansies and snapdragons.###2061||Newly analyzed satellite images of objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean have intensified the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in waters more than 1,500 miles southwest of Australia.

Malaysia's acting transport minister said Saturday that ships are heading to the location. One of the objects appears to be about 70 feet long and 40 feet wide, the BBC, Associated Press and Reuters reported.

"Chinese ships have been dispatched to the area," minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters.

It was a Chinese satellite that took the images. According to China's Xinhua News, the image showing the large object was taken on Tuesday (March 18), which means whatever was seen in the water may have sunk below the surface since then or drifted considerably.

The Indian Ocean is more than 3 miles deep in that area.

Flight 370 and the 239 people on board disappeared from radar screens on March 8 about one hour into its scheduled six-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Most of the plane's communications systems were either disabled or switched off around the time it disappeared. But investigators have followed some clues, including radar data, and believe the jet turned west, crossed the Malay Peninsula and then may have headed south over the Indian Ocean.

Earlier satellite images, taken about a week ago, also showed possible debris in the Indian Ocean about 1,500 miles southwest of Perth, Australia.

Those earlier images were the first possible sign of the missing Boeing 777. They led this week to a refocusing of the search. Aircraft and ships from Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and other nations have been crisscrossing the area. The effort is being led by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

So far, nothing has been spotted.

The newer images taken by the Chinese satellite show objects in the water about 75 miles southwest from where the earlier images spotted something, China's Xinhua News says.

Officials have cautioned that the objects seen in the satellite images may not be related to the missing jet. They might be, for instance, cargo containers that have fallen off ships.###2062||Empty###2063||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

The new laws are minor adjustments to the sweeping pot regulations adopted last year.

The first measure requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

The second measure allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already must have state-level background checks, so the change is not expected to add any additional work for the CBI.

Gov. John Hickenlooper planned to sign the new laws Monday at the Capitol.###2065||Pandora subs to rise as CTO steps down

By Andy Malt | Published on Wednesday 19 March 2014

US streaming platform Pandora has announced that it will increase the price of its ad-free premium service, blaming those pesky royalties it has to pay to music companies for the hike. From May, new Pandora One customers will pay $4.99 per month, though existing subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 for the time being.

A post on the Pandora blog sates: “We’ve been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month. Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015”.

As previously reported, in addition to the royalties Pandora pays the labels via SoundExchange, it has also been quibbling the monies it hands over to the music publishers via their collecting societies.

Last week Pandora won a court ruling in a dispute with one of those societies, ASCAP, which said it should pay 1.85% of annual revenue (Pandora wanted 1.7%) for the publishing rights, rather than the 3% the collecting society was asking for. Though the big music publishers are continuing to lobby for changes in US collective licensing rules, which would allow them to withdraw their digital rights from ASCAP and its counterpart BMI and negotiate direct with services like Pandora.

Elsewhere, Pandora’s Chief Technology Officer and EVP Of Product Tom Conrad is to step down in June, taking on a part time advisory role from July.

Announcing his departure, Graham said in a letter to Pandora staff: “Through all these years perhaps the most gratifying thing has been how the whole company has evolved. From the scrappy group that wrote those first lines of code to the dynamic and talented assemblage we have today, through it all we’ve benefitted from a group of men and woman that are without question the most talented, intelligent, thoughtful and hardworking team I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with”.

Former VP Of Engineering Chris Martin will replace Graham as Chief Technology Officer, while the company is also seeking to hire a Chief Product Officer externally. It has also bee announced that VP Of Technical Operations Steve Ginsberg is being promoted this week, moving into the role of Chief Information Officer.

Maryland’s health exchange this week announced a plan to let consumers who begin the process but fail to sign up by the end of March have extra time to complete their enrollment. Nevada’s exchange said Thursday it will consider a similar 60-day grace period.

And in Washington state, exchange spokeswoman Bethany Frey said customers prevented from enrolling by March 31 because of a system error will have their applications reviewed “on a case-by-case basis.”

The state efforts have not been blessed by the Obama administration, which flatly rejected the additional time.

“The deadline is March 31,” a Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman said.

But Matthew Lawrence, a fellow at Harvard Law School, said it’s no surprise the administration is talking tough now — though it ultimately might find a plausible legal basis to help people bypass the March 31 deadline.

“I expect the administration to wait before announcing any retroactive ‘fix’ for those who tried and failed for fear that an announcement before the deadline could give people a license to procrastinate,” he said.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is confident it’ll have enough sign-ups by the end of the month, including enough young, healthy people, to make the economics of Obamacare work.

Healthier adults are needed to create a balanced risk pool and keep premiums in check when insurers take stock of the first round of enrollment and set prices for the coming year.

“We’re confident that come April 1, you will see a demographic mix that is equal to the objective, which is to ensure that actuarially the marketplaces function effectively,” Mr. Carney said.

Once final enrollment numbers are known, the next question will be what insurers do with premiums headed into 2015.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently told Congress she thinks premiums will rise in the coming year, but at a slower rate than usual because of the law.

Some industry professionals disagreed with Mrs. Sebelius assessment in news reports, saying premiums could spike multifold in some areas because of the troubled rollout.

Dan Mendelson, CEO of the Avalere health care consultancy in Washington, said a spike in premiums on the Obamacare marketplace is feasible, although likely a “not massive” one, and that the exchanges should remain competitive.

He said the March 31 deadline is in place in part to give companies a chance to take stock of where things are.

“You have to allow plans to reset, think about premiums and have a structured process,” he said.

Any tangible spike this year would damage Democratic candidates who supported the law and are up for re-election in November, as Republicans have made it clear they will wield Obamacare’s troubles as a truncheon during the mid-term contests.

The law’s stumbles are even causing intraparty problems in Maryland, where Democratic candidates to succeed Gov. Martin O’Malley are sparring over the state’s glitchy exchange website and the governor is trying to stem any bleeding over the coming days.

On Tuesday, it announced a stopgap measure to help — through telephone guidance — anyone who tried to sign up by March 31, but couldn’t complete their application by that date.

Kentucky’s exchange will allow people to apply for coverage by March 31 and pick a plan by April 15, exchange spokeswoman Gwenda Bond said.

The French businessman, formerly managing director of Hermès, started in the role two years ago to the month, during which time the label has lost two-thirds of its market value.

Godfrey Davis, the brand's non-executive chairman and previous CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found. The company is still searching for a creative director, following the departure of Emma Hill in September 2013.

Prior to Guillon's appointment, Mulberry was recognised as one of London's most high-profile brands, resonating with fashion followers, celebrities and professional women. Its bags had widespread appeal, particularly the Alexa satchel - which caused its profits to soar - and its catwalk shows were known for their starry front rows, including Kate Moss, Michelle Williams and Lana Del Rey. Upon joining Mulberry in March 2012, Guillon raised the label's prices and streamlined its famously large-scale parties in a bid to make it a serious luxury contender. Over the past two years, the brand has lost some of its playful, quintessentially British, youthful appeal, with its direction becoming increasingly unclear.

Last season, the brand cancelled its London Fashion Week show and instead staged a presentation in which Cara Delevingne unveiled a collection of self-designed bags - a move that, although it distracted the press, did not negate the company's need to find a new creative director. Names rumoured to be filling the post have included Hannah MacGibbon, Erdem Moralioglu, Roland Mouret, Mary Katrantzou and Sophie Hulme.###2068||By P.J. Gladnick

Ooooh! Let’s throw a Brosurance keg party!!!

The March Obamacare numbers are surging! Yes, in just the first two weeks of March, the number of “enrollees” has surged 800,000 from 4.2 million to 5 million. How do I know this? Because the Department of Health and Human Services told me so and the most “transparent” administration in history would never fib, would they? If you think that your humble correspondent is incredibly naive for blindly swallowing the HHS Obamacare numbers, I am just reflecting the attitude of a report at NBC News written by senior health writer Maggie Fox acting as if she were a stenographer for the HHS PR department:

“Five million people have now signed up for health insurance on the state and federal online exchanges, the Obama administration said Monday — a number that suggests a big-last minute surge to get coverage.

“The new figures suggest a final push by the White House to get people to enroll is working. The deadline to get signed up for 2014 is March 31, just two weeks away. As of March 1, the Health and Human Services Department said 4.2 million people had signed up.”

I am so excited that I can hardly contain myself! But after that moment of excitement, nagging questions start to gnaw at me. Like questions about how many of those supposed enrollees have actually paid for their Obamacare? Ms Fox conveniently refrains from exploring that piece of data but many of her readers in the comments section express the healthy skepticism that Fox completely avoids:

“HHS actually tells you it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to know how many people have actually paid, this despite word from the Insurance Industry that they have been reporting these numbers to HHS all along.

“Less than 2% of Americans get Obama Care. But how many people had their insurance cancel them because of the changes?

“Now 1 million people have signed up in the last 2 weeks???????????? Since we are getting these #’s, how about the number of people who have active , paid for coverage now?????”

We landed a man on the moon 35 years ago. We invented wireless communication. We basically are living much like the cartoon Jetsons. Yet we can’t count how many people have paid for the policy? This defies common sense.

Vermont's unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average - the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state's unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers - the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

"The January numbers start the year on a positive note," Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. "Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth."

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February's report is due out in late March.###2070||Similar Content You May Enjoy

Application may not work as expected.###2075||Florida's unemployment rate dropped slightly in January, although the actual number of jobs actually shrank, according to new data released Monday.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida's unemployment rate dropped slightly in January, although the actual number of jobs actually shrank, according to new data released Monday.



The mixed results did not stop Gov. Rick Scott from touting the latest numbers as he focused on the steady recovery of the state's economy.



"It is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," Scott said in a statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow."



Scott has made the rebound in the state's economy a centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. He has noted in campaign speeches that the unemployment rate increased under former Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist, who is now a Democrat and challenging Scott, has said Florida suffered because of the economic downturn that affected most of the nation and world.



The state's unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, which was lower than it was at the end of the year. The rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.



There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.



Despite the overall rate dropping slightly by 0.2 percent, the overall number of jobs in the state dropped by 2,600. The number of jobs is calculated using a separate survey.



Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, noted the decline to jobs to blast Scott for "desperately attempting to take credit for a recovery that's more anemic than what the economy was already predicted to do on its own."



Florida overall has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida trailed Texas and California.



Scott has said the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies, including his push to cut back on regulation and lower taxes.



But economists who work for the Florida Legislature have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or delayed their job search. A state economic overview released in February concluded that if the number of people in the labor force had held steady since December 2011, the real unemployment rate would be 7.9 percent.



Monroe County in the southern end of the state had the state's lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, followed by Walton County in the Panhandle at 4.2 percent. Hendry County, in the southern interior, had the highest unemployment rate at 9.8 percent, followed by Flagler County in northeast Florida at 9.3 percent.###2076||THE new 12-sided £1 coin will be the hardest to fake in the world, but is likely to cost the economy up to £20m in vending machine and trolley modifications.

The Treasury has said the new coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about the current £1 coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting.

"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," said a Treasury spokesman.

The new coin is based on the design of the old three-penny piece, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

Chancellor George Osborne tweeted an image of the coin ahead of today's Budget.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The Royal Mint, which believes three per cent of existing £1 coins are fake, said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and ultimately reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

However, the Royal Mint's director of circulation, Andrew Mills, has said it is "a likelihood" that every vending machine will have to change to fit the coin.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mills said the cost to the economy over the next three years for changes to vending machines and trolleys will be around £15m to £20m.

He added that it was important to look at the benefits of the coin and said that the Royal Mint will be consulting with the Automatic Vending Association and other industries to ensure the changeover runs as "smoothly as possible".

The current pound coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing out of the pound note, which was withdrawn five years later.

The new coin will be bi-metallic and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be authenticated at all points. While the Queen's head will be on one side of the coin, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.###2077||Empty###2078||Bruno Guillon quit as chief executive of Mulberry today, less than two months after the British luxury fashion company issued a profit warning that had piled the pressure on the Frenchman and his new strategy of hiking prices.

Bruno Guillon quit as chief executive of Mulberry today, less than two months after the British luxury fashion company issued a profit warning that had piled the pressure on the Frenchman and his new strategy of hiking prices.

In a very brief statement, the maker of Bayswater and Alexa handbags said Guillon had advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect. He had been CEO for just over two years.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Under Guillon, Mulberry had hiked prices to take its brand more upmarket from a traditional position of "affordable luxury", and embarked on a drive to increase the company's profile overseas, targeting affluent Asian shoppers with new stores in key tourist spots.

But the group was forced to downgrade its profit forecasts at the end of January for the third time in around 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting in its main British market over Christmas hit sales.

The announcement sent its shares plunging over 25pc at the time and they have still not recovered.

"(Guillon) has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales," Davis said. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.



The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.



SEE INTERACTIVE FEATURE HERE



Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.



One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia's southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.



"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.



Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia's capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."



News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.



"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.



But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."



Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don't have � the location of MH370."



Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."



Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).



Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.



"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.



The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.



Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."



Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.



The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.



The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.



Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.



But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.



Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.



Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.



Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association told The Associated Press.



"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.



The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.



Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.



Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.



The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.###2081||Empty###2082||"I'm trying to follow and figure out who the winners are in this tariff war," said North Dakota farmer Greg Gebeke. "I know who one of the losers are and that's us. And that's painful."###2083||A deepening economic standoff between Russia and the west over the future of Ukraine has rippled through trading floors and boardrooms with exporters scrambling to protect revenues and global financial firms halting services.

US President Barack Obama's threat to target major sections of the Russian economy should President Vladimir Putin follow-up his annexation of Crimea with further incursions in Ukraine has caused alarm across Europe.

Denmark's foreign ministry held a special briefing for about 130 companies, including drugs firm Novo Nordisk and brewer Carlsberg, after being inundated with inquiries about the business implications of the crisis.

In an email to Reuters, Carlsberg's chief executive said he was monitoring the situation closely and would act if sanctions had a direct impact on his drinks group's business. The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia.

"Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems," said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. "Our focus is on our employees and our breweries."

Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price.

With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the west's sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked.

"We're sending the machines specially made for Russia to Russia and we are leaving the machines that we can sell in other countries here due to the risk."

Profine, a plastic window frame manufacturer with annual revenues of €700m, has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won't be able to do that forever.

"If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners," said Peter Mrosik, the German firm's managing partner.

President Obama unveiled sanctions against members of President Putin's inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally.

In response, Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Mr Obama's list.

SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating US sanctions on countries such as Iran.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals.

Germany's main trade body warned that full-blown economic sanctions would be a "real catastrophe".

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany's "wise men" council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia's importance as an energy exporter.

"What has been announced so far is really nothing. It is purely cosmetic," said a French banker based in Moscow.

"The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in US dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars," said the banker, who declined to be named.

"Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically."

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home.

But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

"It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It's very difficult to predict," said another western banker in Moscow.

"I haven't heard of any western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out."

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis has soared to over $100bn.

With that figure expected to climb, western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

Since the US and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to President Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia's state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

"We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won't annul or destroy everything we've built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented," he said on a business trip to Chile this week.###2084||Empty###2085||For the 24 hours to 23:00 GMT, GBP fell 0.26% against the USD and closed at 1.6596, after Ukraine remained firm on its view that the Crimea peninsula would continue to be part of its country, suggesting more friction with Russia.

On the macro front, the Ministry of Finance reported that Japan’s merchandise (total) trade deficit narrowed to ¥800.3 billion in February, from a revised deficit of ¥2791.7 billion recorded in the previous month. Markets had expected Japan’s merchandise (total) trade deficit to narrow to ¥600.9 billion in February.

Additionally, the Cabinet Office of Japan reported that final leading economic index in Japan rose to a level of 113.1 in January, higher than the flash estimate of 112.2, while the final coincident index rose to a level of 115.2 in January, compared to a revised level of 112.2 recorded in the previous month.

The pair is expected to find support at 101.13, and a fall through could take it to the next support level of 100.90. The pair is expected to find its first resistance at 101.74, and a rise through could take it to the next resistance level of 102.11.

The currency pair is showing convergence with its 20 Hr moving average and is trading below its 50 Hr moving average.

The letter was sent by Henry Waxman of California, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and Diana DeGette of Colorado. It was addressed to Gilead Sciences, the maker of the drug referred to as Sovaldi.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the congressmen wrote in their letter, as reported by the New York Times.

On the other hand, Gilead Sciences explained that the price for Sovaldi is the fairest price that they could offer for the drug. The company’s executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, Gregg Alton, expressed that they are willing to meet with the members of the Congress to settle the issue.

“We think the price is fair,” he said in an interview with the N.Y Times. “It will save the system money long term.”

It is estimated that three to four million Americans are suffering from hepatitis C. If left untreated, it could lead to more serious infections such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Sovaldi was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2013 and could cure 80 percent of hepatitis C cases in a matter of 12 weeks. This is a higher cure rate using the least amount of time possible. Treatment using Sovaldi was also noted to induce the least cases of side effects.

However, insurers argue that a 12-week treatment with Sovaldi can cost $1000 a pill, and this is very expensive.

“It’s unprecedented that we have a drug that is this expensive that this many patients can benefit from,” Dr. Steve Miller told N.Y Times. Miller is the chief medical officer for Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefits manager. “You have a drug that has the potential to break a lot of the payers.”###2087||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired chief executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 per cent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," the company said.

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.###2088||City Index

US interest rates could increase soon after the Federal Reserve hinted it is considering a change to monetary policy in the coming months.

Chair of the Fed Janet Yellen stated that interest rates could start to go up in the US as early as next year. Ms Yellen, who was the preferred candidate of president Barack Obama, took over the role from Ben Bernanke towards the end of 2013.

At a press conference, Ms Yellen said: "This is the kind of term it's hard to define. Probably means something on the order of six months, or that type of thing."

Ms Yellen made her comments to reporters shortly after it was announced that the Fed said it is going to scale back bond purchases by a further $10 billion (£6 billion) per month. This means it is now three times in a row that the central bank has tightened its stimulus efforts.

Date of rate change

Bond purchases are now expected to end later this year, which would imply rate increases will start to take place at around April 2015.

Overnight interest rates in the US were lowered by the Fed to zero per cent in December 2008, a move which was a response to the global financial crash, which damaged the US economy.

Mr Obama has overseen a recovery in the country's financial situation in the last few years, but Ms Yellen will now be looking to increase the pace of growth, while making sure it remains at a responsible and sustainable level.

In a statement released to announce its latest policy decision earlier in the month, the Fed said: "This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labour market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."

While the US looks set to increase interest rates sooner rather than later, the base rate in the UK remains at a record low of 0.5 per cent, as it has for the last five years. However, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is reported to be mulling over a rate rise in the near future.

March 20, 2014

Category: General News Posted:02:37AMAuthor: gebraset

Over the last five years, Pandora One has been able to keep its cost steady, charging subscribers of the service $3.99 per month. As content costs have gone upwards however, with Pandora claiming that the royalty rates it pays performers via SoundExchange have increased 53 percent in the last five years, Pandora has announced that its subscription model is undergoing some changes. The main focal point of these changes is that Pandora One will go up in price, costing listeners $4.99 per month, or $1 more per month. The change is not set to take effect until May of this year, and customers can even lock in the current price on a new loyalty program if they subscribe before the change is implemented.

It is worth noting that the annual subscription option for Pandora One is ending, forcing subscribers of the service to pay monthly. The advertisement laden version of Pandora will still be available for free for listeners who chose to not subscribe to Pandora One.###2090||Why did this happen?

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2092||Empty###2093||Empty###2094||Washington/Sydney: French satellite scans provided fresh indications of objects adrift in part of the Indian Ocean that’s being scoured for the missing plane—Malaysia Airlines MH370—backing up Chinese evidence, as more planes and ships joined the hunt.

Eight aircraft searched 59,000sq.km of sea after China on Saturday revealed a satellite photo depicting a floating object 22.5mt (74 feet) long. Radar images from French authorities show potential objects in the vicinity, Malaysia’s transport ministry said on Sunday.

The developments rekindled prospects for breakthrough in the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 after radar and visual scans failed to find objects spotted in earlier images taken from space. Searchers, bolstered by a growing fleet of international vessels, also want to locate a wooden pallet seen from the air to check if it could have come from the jet’s hold.

“The aircraft are operating at extreme ranges,” said Australian Maritime Safety Authority official Mike Barton, “with the closest airfield 2,500km away”. “They’re operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of 1-2 hours in the search area.”

The Chinese photo, taken 18 March, is focused 90 degrees east and almost 45 degrees south, versus almost 91 degrees east and 44 degrees south for similar items on a 16 March satellite image, putting the object 120km southwest of that sighting, according to China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

Coloured straps

The dimensions appear similar to those of the larger of two objects seen previously, said to be 24mt long. The Malaysian plane, a The Boeing Co. 777-200, measures 63mt, with a wingspan of 61mt and a 6.2mt cabin diameter.

“French satellite images were received this morning and have been sent to the Australian centre leading the search in the southern Indian Ocean,” a Malaysian government statement said.

The French foreign affairs ministry said radar echoes had detected floating debris 2,300km from Perth and that extra satellites would be mobilized to pursue the search. No date or coordinates for the discovery were immediately provided.

“Separately, the wooden pallet spotted on Saturday from a civil search aircraft was among a number of small objects spread over 5km and could be of the kind used in planes,” the AMSA’s Barton told reporters on Sunday, adding that there appeared to be evidence of multi-coloured strapping belts around it. “The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry,” Barton said. “They’re usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft.”

Ships converge

A New Zealand P3 Orion surveillance plane dispatched to the scene on Saturday found only clumps of seaweed. “The more aircraft we have, the more ships we have, the more confident we are of recovering whatever material is down there,” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Sunday in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, according to a transcript. “Obviously before we can be too specific about what it might be, we do actually need to recover some of this material.”

As more potential debris is spotted, a growing fleet of vessels is converging on the area, while the number of planes deployed was increased to eight from six on Sunday, including four long-range civil aircraft and a US Navy P8 Poseidon.

HMAS Success from the Royal Australian Navy has joined the search, while the Ocean Shield, equipped with a sub-sea remotely operated vehicle, is on its way to the zone, as is HMS Echo, a specialist ship from Britain’s Royal Navy that’s fitted with underwater listening gear and devices to survey the seabed.

Sea fog

“The US was asked by Malaysia to provide similar search technology,” the US defence department said in a statement. Australia said two merchant vessels assisted in the hunt on Saturday, while China deployed at least seven ships, according to the Xinhua News Agency, a flotilla that reflects the urgency it attaches to finding Flight MH370, whose complement of 239 passengers and crew included more than 150 Chinese nationals.

“Sea fog hampered the search early on Sunday before conditions improved, though there were no sightings of significance before nightfall,” the AMAS said.

“Two Chinese Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft will join the hunt from Perth tomorrow and two Japanese P3 Orions left for the West Australian city today,” the Malaysian govt said.

“Two Indian military planes are also headed to the northern part of the zone. A US Orion plane is operating out of Malaysia and is scanning south of Indonesia in the vicinity of the Cocos Islands,” Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an e-mail. “The plane had previously been searching for debris in the Bay of Bengal.”

FBI role

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also joined the probe as Malaysian authorities seek data from a home computer flight simulator belonging to the jet’s captain.

The FBI has received digital media from Malaysian authorities, including information from the simulator’s hard drive, and technicians are examining the data in Virginia, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the case who asked not to be named because the probe is ongoing.

“Investigators are trying to learn more about what the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, did on the simulator, and part of that effort involves trying to examine files that may have been deleted from the drive,” the official said.

FBI agent Michael Kortan, a spokesman for the bureau, declined to comment. “The simulator hasn’t produced any clear lead yet for investigators,” Malaysia’s acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Saturday.

“Neither have authorities found any link between the aircraft’s cargo, which included lithium batteries, and its disappearance,” Hishammuddin said. “My biggest concern is that if we are not able to identify the debris, having to go back to the two corridors is a huge and massive area,” he said. “This is unprecedented.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said that the jet emitted pulse-like signals to a satellite about seven hours after last making voice contact, shifting the focus of the search to two arcs, one extending north to Kazakhstan and the other into the southern Indian Ocean. “In the northern zone, there have been no indications of the missing airplane on radar in China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,” Hishammuddin said.

Tropical cyclone

“Already facing strong currents and rough seas, the Indian Ocean search could be disrupted by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gillian,” Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, head of Malaysia’s civil aviation authority, told reporters near Kuala Lumpur airport. The storm is about 2,500km northwest of Perth, having passed over Christmas Island, and tracking slowly south.

Steady flight

An analysis of satellite pings shows that the Malaysian Airline System BHD 777 may have flown steadily across the ocean after diverting from its scheduled route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. That assessment gave the clearest idea yet on how investigators pinpointed a search zone.

Engineers at Inmarsat PLC, whose satellite picked up the pings, plotted seven positions for the jet on 8 March, Chris McLaughlin, a company spokesman, said in an interview. “The plane flew steadily away from the satellite over the equator while pinging,” McLaughlin said. The data helped investigators conclude that the most logical path was progressively either north or south, with the bulk of search efforts focused on the south.

“I hope that we’ll find the time soon when we’re able to conclusively say once and for all that we are close to finding where this plane may now be located, and that there can be some kind of closure for families,” Australia’s deputy prime minister Warren Truss told reporters on Sunday. “We will continue as long as there’s hope.” Bloomberg###2095||Latest Stories

The online room-rental service Airbnb is reportedly close to securing a new round of funding that would value the company at $10bn – making it worth more than several leading hotel chains.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the San Francisco-based company is in advanced talks to raise between $400m and $500m with private-equity firm TPG. At $10bn, Airbnb would be one of the world’s most valuable startups and worth more than than Hyatt Hotels ($8.3bn) or Wyndham Worldwide ($9.4bn).



Founded in 2008, Airbnb allows individuals to rent out rooms, apartments and homes for short stays. The company is arguably the world’s largest hotel company, having helped set up more than 10m stays in 550,000 rooms in 34,000 cities. It added nearly 250,000 properties to its service in 2013.

Airbnb’s popularity has attracted the ire of hotel chains who claim the service allows renters to dodge lodging taxes and that the company should be regulated in the same way that they are.

New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb last October demanding information on its 15,000 hosts in the state. New York state law prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if the host is not present. The challenge came after Airbnb had pledged to work with the state to collect occupancy taxes and root out bad actors. The company is contesting the order, arguing it is unreasonably broad.

Airbnb’s valuation has quadrupled since it last raised money in 2012 at a price that valued it at $2.5bn from investors including PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Ashton Kutcher is another of the company’s early backers.

The company is part of the so-called “sharing economy” that has shaken up the taxi industry as well as the hotel industry with services like Uber and Lyft that allow people to use their own cars to freelance as part-time taxi drivers. Uber is valued at $3.8bn, following an investment last year by Google Ventures, TPG and others.###2097||Please enable Javascript to watch this video

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Wal-Mart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards that they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

Those comments are already questionable. Obamacare caused the average individual health plan premium to increase by 39% between 2013 and 2014 and the average family plan to increase by 56%, according to data provided last month by eHealthInsurance.com.

These increases surpass the average of the previous eight years combined, a consequence of the law’s actuarial requirements, taxes and fees, as well as the mandated essential benefits.

For their part, insurers are disputing Sebelius’ claim, The Hill reports. They’re expecting premiums to rise sharply in some areas of the country, perhaps double or triple, which is partially blamed on the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare exchange:

Health industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration.

[…]

“It’s pretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out … is going to lead to higher costs,” said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity. The insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange. The hikes are expected to vary substantially by region, state and carrier. Areas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.

[…]

“My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant,” said Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and current senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Hoagland said Sebelius was seeking to “soften up the American public” to the likelihood that premiums will rise, despite promises to the contrary.

Insurers are also pointing out that the age demographics are unbalanced, which will also contribute to the rise in insurance premiums, though that’s something that will be determine on a state-by-state bases, since they determine factor expected costs through the lens of individual state exchanges, not one big risk pool.

There are a couple things to consider after reading this report. First, the ripple effects in the insurance market. Assuming that premium increases do double or triple in some areas of the country, that would likely depress enrollment numbers for the 2015 open enrollment period. Insurers would, once again, readjust with higher premiums. At that point, we’re looking at a death spiral.

Though some have argued that bailout provisions would prevent a death spiral scenario in the transitional period, the fact that insurers are openly warning about very significant premium increases should speak volumes.

Remember, the individual mandate has been effectively gutted for two years. Anyone who doesn’t want to buy insurance could claim a loosely defined “hardship exemption” to avoid any tax penalties.

The other point is the electoral ramifications. Insurers will begin submitting their rates for 2015 in the next two or three months, which state insurance commissioners will have to approve. Though the next open enrollment period has been delayed until after the mid-term election, there will be countless stories about expected premium increases.

Those premium increases will receive a lot of attention in states where there are competitive House and Senate races, and that only serves to bolster Republicans’ chances of taking the upper chamber.###2099||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Security software developer Symantec Corp. gave the boot to Chief Executive Steve Bennett as the company’s turnaround appears to be taking longer than expected.

In a statement earlier on Thursday, Symantec did not offer much of an explanation.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec,” board chairman Daniel Schulman said. “We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.” He added that the decision “was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

Symantec Outgoing Symantec CEO Steve Bennett.

Two and a half weeks ago, Bennett, who was appointed CEO in July 2012, told a Morgan Stanley Technology Conference that he planned to tell the board at an upcoming retreat that the company’s turnaround targets were still “very doable.” Perhaps the board thinks Symantec SYMC, +2.67% should be hitting its targets sooner.

“We’re going to have a tough year on margin expansion next year and revenue growth just [because of] the economics of the model, but we’re very excited about 2016 and 2017,” Bennett said earlier this month. He will be replaced on an interim basis by board member Michael Brown.

The developer of such products as Norton Antivirus software has been hit hard by the PC market’s steady decline. It has also struggled with a shift in the software industry to software as a service, or to a subscription model, versus the one-time licensing cost. Symantec will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results May 7.

Bennett had told the Morgan Stanley conference that the only way the company could meet the current profit margin target was through more cost cuts. “We took out about $200 million this year. I’m not going to do that again next year.”

Sounds like there might have been some disagreement about strategy or his approach to the turnaround. But will another CEO be able to move any faster without making more big cuts as well?

Investors were not pleased with the news, driving Symantec’s shares down over 6%.

Gox found 200,000 forgotten bitcoins, a week after the online currency exchange filed for bankruptcy claiming that all its bitcoins had been stolen, the company said in a statement Thursday.

Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that the bitcoins were found in an old electronic wallet that the company had previously believed was empty and was last used in June 2011. Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, stating that it had lost all of its 850,000 bitcoins, said that it moved the newly-found bitcoins into offline wallets due to “security reasons.” The discovery of the bitcoins was made known to the courts, lawyers and other authorities, the company said.

“Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC (balance of bitcoins), the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC,” Mt. Gox said in the statement.

When the company filed for bankruptcy, it had said that, due to a technical issue, its customers were able to make fraudulent withdrawals on the exchange. While Mt. Gox claimed it had fallen victim to a technical problem due to which one of the largest exchanges of the digital currency had to declare bankruptcy, others had speculated about the possibility of fraud on the exchange’s part.

On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago, supervising a lawsuit against Mt. Gox, revised a previous order and allowed some of the exchange's bitcoin movements to be tracked.

"Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it "found" these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins," Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters.

Jonathan Waller, an investor who develops bitcoin-related projects said, according to Financial Times: “It’s good they’ve found some of the Bitcoins but I think it was a badly run system which lost control of their Bitcoins."

Earlier in March, the Japanese government had struggled to explain how the world’s largest bitcoin exchange lost about nearly a billion units of the digital currency. A London-based firm, Selachii LLP, also filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, raising further doubts about the exchange's claims of a hack.

Last week, Karpeles’ Reddit account and his personal blog were breached and the hackers claimed that they found some discrepancies in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins that Mt. Gox claimed was stolen.

The hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox’s accounts while the exchange reported that 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its clients and 100,000 bitcoins of its own had been lost in the hack.###2102||Airbnb, the online home-rental company, is in talks with private equity firms to raise at least $400m (£242m) – a level of funding that would value the business at roughly $10bn.

That’s a market value higher than some established hotel and lodging companies including Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide.

TPG Capital Management is expected to lead the funding. TPG also has an investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another dominant player in the sector known as the “sharing economy”.

Airbnb has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-up companies in the five years since it was founded by graduates from Harvard and Rhode Island School of Design.

But its business model has attracted attention from authorities.

The company is involved in a legal fight with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has subpoenaed Airbnb for information to try to determine if any of its customers are violating New York state laws.

New York state does not allow renters to sublet their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present.

And the San Francisco city attorney's office has also queried the type of short-term rentals offered by Airbnb following claims that Airbnb rentals take away supply from the rented housing and drive up rents.###2103||Money (AFP)

All but one of the 30 largest banks are now strong enough to weather another severe economic crash, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

In the newest of the series of health examinations mandated after the 2008 financial crisis, only Zions Bancorp could not measure up to a basic capital standard in a theoretical drastic meltdown of the economy.

Twenty-nine bank holding companies held up in the worst-case scenario with a cumulative 7.8 percent Tier 1 common ratio, a basic measure of capital strength, down from 11.5 percent at the end of the third quarter last year, but ending well above the 5.0 percent minimum target.

That represented a steady strengthening of the sector since the tests began three years ago,

Salt Lake City, Utah-based Zions Bancorp was the only one which fell below the threshold, finishing the year-long period of the theoretical meltdown with just a 3.5 percent tier 1 common ratio — the level of shareholder equity and reserves.

The banks were measured against a situation when real gross domestic product contracts 4.75 percent, the unemployment rate hits 11.25 percent, equities shed half their value and home prices lose a quarter of their value.

Bank Rossiya, and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk, were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, played down his association with the bank, but ordered the central bank to support the lender.

“And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand, it is a medium-sized bank,” he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council. “I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday.”

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

Little has been known about Bank Rossiya, which has risen to become the country's 15th largest bank by assets last year from 54th in just six years.

Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder in the St Petersburg-based bank is a close Putin ally. The friendship between the two dates back to the early 1990s, when Putin served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

Kovalchuk was also one of the three founding members of the Ozero (Lake) luxury dachas complex outside St Petersburg who were targeted by the U.S. sanctions

“Kovalchuk … Timchenko … I think I need to stay away from them,” Putin joked on Friday.

The bank's operations are concentrated around St Petersburg and Moscow, serving chiefly clients in oil, gas and energy. The bank also controls large insurance firms Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

“Our companies will continue using the services of the bank,” a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

The bank paid 106.5 roubles ($2.94) per ordinary share in dividends on 2012 earnings for a total payout of 267.1 million roubles ($7.37 million), suggesting that Kovalchuk got $1 million in dividends for his stake.

According to a 2008 article by the business daily Vedomosti, nearly 4 percent of the bank belonged to a distant cousin of Putin, Mikhail Shelomov.

One of the bank's clients, the state electricity holding firm InterRAO is run by Kovalchuk's son Boris Kovalchuk.

“We have small rouble deposits and an insignificant loan burden, in both roubles and foreign currency, but settlements for the latter are made in roubles,” Anton Nazarov, a representative of InteRAO told Reuters, without disclosing the amounts.

Three of the bank's clients, the utility holdings FSK , Moscow United Electric Grid Co. (MOESK) and the grid company Rosseti, told Reuters they hold only rouble accounts at the bank.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following Washington's sanctions. Western Union the world's largest money transfer company, has also suspended its services for the bank.

“The bank has a strong liquidity cushion and the imposed sanctions will not affect the company's operations,” Bank Rossiya said in a statement late on Friday.

“Currently, there is no area (of the bank's operation) that would require assistance from the Central Bank.”

The Russian central bank said that it stood ready to support the sanctions-hit bank. “If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors,” it said in a statement.###2105||Empty###2106||###2107||Licking the wounds after a visit from the biotechology bears…

Several big biotech names tumbled Friday, some more than 8%, leaving a sea of red for investors. But is the sell-off long term or just a dreary day on Wall Street?

GILD Your browser does not support iframes.

Many thought the selloff was due to Democratic lawmakers coming down on Gilead Sciences Inc. /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD over the pricing of its promising new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which is $84,000 for a 12-week treatment. Shares ended the day off more than 4% to $72.07.

But there also have been mounting worries over froth forming in the biotech sector and a possible correction on the horizon. It probably won’t be known just how meaningful Friday’s selloff was until next week, or beyond. There is one cause for concern, though, as four major biotech exchange-traded funds all lost more than 4% with many hitting historic lows.

One frequently watched gauge among ETFs, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB , dropped nearly 5% when it was all over. It was noted that the fund neared its 100-day moving average by RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.

Yee noted that “sentiment is rolling over in biotech a bit” in a note on one big name in the sector, Celgene Corp. /quotes/zigman/69584/delayed /quotes/nls/celg CELG , which lost nearly 4% to $144.40 at the close. He also noted that even though Celgene won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday for Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug, that stock crashed its 200-day moving average.

“However, we’ll state it again that the fundamentals [on Celgene] haven’t changed,” he said. Yee contends the launch of Otezla should be uneventful.

ISI Group’s Mark Schoenebaum noted data shows the drug isn’t as powerful as competing treatments but has fewer side effects and is cheaper — perhaps a strong suit considering Gilead’s pricing issues. He says although a full-year of Otezla is priced at $22,500, it still is a discount to virtually all other drugs used for the same treatment. And consensus shows it should bring in more than $1 billion in revenue by 2017.

Ten states are key to attracting Obamacare enrollees, story says###2108||Bentonville – Walmart is getting in on a business that impacts more than 110 million gamers across the country.

Starting Wednesday (March 26), customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value towards purchases of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online, according to a news release Tuesday.

The games will be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase at a lower price, according to the news release.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,” Naughton said.

Here is how it works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online.

Later this year, customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and online. They will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned.”###2109||Empty###2110||It just keeps getting worse for GameStop (NYSE:GME). Not only is it facing growing competition from its own suppliers, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE), but soon it will have to take on the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).

While Wal-Mart has been selling video games (both hardware and software) for years, the discount chain is about to challenge GameStop in an entirely new way: Later this month, Wal-Mart will begin dealing in used video games. While I wouldn't expect Wal-Mart's new initiative to obliterate GameStop's business overnight, it's only increasing the pressure on a retailer that's becoming less relevant by the day.

The looming threat of digital distribution

GameStop is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the S&P 500, with a short float near 30%. While different investors may be working from different theses, the larger case against GameStop primarily centers around the promise of digital distribution.

It's no secret that the video game industry is going digital. Like movies and music before them, video games are increasingly shifting from physical discs to digital downloads. Owners of Microsoft's and Sony's latest consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, can, if they so desire, deal exclusively in digital -- downloading all of their games directly from the companies' respective digital storefronts, something that couldn't be done with prior machines.

But there are still many reasons that gamers would prefer to own a physical copy, and so physical games live on for the time being. Some gamers lack the robust broadband connections required for large game downloads, while others may prefer to have a physical copy that they could sell or lend to a friend. These obstacles cannot be overlooked, but should be overcome in time.

For their part, both Microsoft and Sony are working hard to encourage gamers to embrace digital distribution. Microsoft has begun to offer aggressive discounts on digital versions of its games, a strategy that allowed Valve to dominate the PC gaming space. Sony has similar "flash" sales, but has taken it a step further.

This summer, Sony's "PlayStation Now" service will roll out to owners of its PlayStation 4 video game console, allowing them to stream digital versions of games directly over the Internet. It remains to be seen if the service will be successful, but if it catches on, it will pose an obvious threat, particularly if Sony can expand PlayStation Now to include newer titles.

While most sell-side analysts continue to downplay the threat posed by digital distribution, some of them have begun to come around. Last month, Longbow Research downgraded GameStop to underperform, citing the risks posed by digital distribution.

Wal-Mart comes after GameStop's core market

With its suppliers in open rebellion, GameStop's problems are about to intensify. Whatever market remains for used video games in the coming years, GameStop will have to share it with Wal-Mart. GameStop has a number of advantages over Wal-Mart -- a smaller, more focused operation; more knowledgeable employees; and its PowerUp Rewards program -- but Wal-Mart has advantages of its own.

Namely, Wal-Mart plans to offer traders general store credit -- meaning that a pile of old video games could be traded for a cart of groceries, a tank of gas, a new TV, or any of the tens of thousands of items Wal-Mart stocks. In contrast, video games traded in to GameStop can only become more games, video game-related hardware, or used mobile devices. (Admittedly, GameStop will pay cash, but far less than what it pays in credit.)

Given that used video game products account for about one-quarter of GameStop's revenue and almost half of its profit, Wal-Mart's entrance into the space cannot be discounted. Either GameStop will lose market share or it will be forced to work harder to retain its market, sacrificing margins in the process.###2111||Empty###2112||Norfolk, VA (23510)

“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” said TIGTA Inspector General J. Russell George in a statement. He noted that TIGTA has received reports of over 20,000 contacts and has become aware of thousands of victims who have collectively paid over $1 million as a result of the scam, in which individuals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials.

“The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming,” said George. “At all times, and particularly during the tax filing season, we want to make sure that innocent taxpayers are alert to this scam so they are not harmed by these criminals. Do not become a victim.”

George urged taxpayers to heed warnings about the sophisticated phone scam targeting taxpayers, noting that the scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every state in the country. Callers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.

The truth, TIGTA pointed out, is the IRS usually first contacts people by mail—not by phone—about unpaid taxes. The IRS also won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer, and the agency won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone.

“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” said George.

The callers who commit this fraud typically use common names and fake IRS badge numbers, TIGTA noted. The scammers also frequently know the last four digits of the victim's Social Security Number make the caller ID information appear as if the IRS is calling, making the scam even more convincing. In addition, they tend to send bogus IRS e-mails to support their scam, and call a second time claiming to be the policy or department of motor vehicles, and the caller ID again supports their claim.

TIGTA said that if you receive a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS asking for a payment, here’s what to do. If you owe federal taxes, or think you may owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions. If you don't owe taxes, call and report the incident to TIGTA at 800-366-4484. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov. Add "IRS Telephone Scam" to the comments in your complaint.

TIGTA and the IRS are encouraging taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name. The IRS said it will never request personal or financial information by email, texting or any social media. Taxpayers who received scam e-mails should forward them to phishing@irs.gov, but they should not open any attachments or click on any links in those emails.

Taxpayers also should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes winner) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS.

But analysts were buoyed by the numbers because they reflected positive economic movement.



“We know there were employers hiring only for the holiday season and that those workers have been laid off,” said Margie Genter, who oversees eight Goodwill Job Connection offices in Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee and DeSoto counties. “But we also know there are more jobs available, so that people who had given up their job search are coming back into the job market.”



Statistics released Monday by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity show that more people, encouraged by what they consider an improving labor market, have re-entered the job pool at a time when payroll positions also are on the rise.



At the end of January, the labor force in the three-county area was 385,813, up 3,754 workers from a month earlier.



At the same time, payrolls got a little bigger. The number of employed workers rose by 2,040, to 362,286.



Statewide, the department reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, down two-tenths of a point from a revised December rate of 6.3 percent and nearly 2 percentage points better than the 8 percent of a year earlier.



Florida, overall, has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That was third best in the nation, trailing just Texas and California, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.



In issuing figures for January, the state also revised its numbers for 2013, replacing rougher survey numbers with more accurate job counts.



That yearly process, called bench-marking, showed Florida payrolls at 7.68 million at year end, up 35,600 from an earlier estimate.



Economists were generally encouraged by the report.



“Two-thousand thirteen looked better than it did originally, as far as job creation,” said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida.



The year-end numbers “confirm our story line, which has been a positive outlook, a fairly strong rebound in Florida and in the Sarasota area as well,” said Mekael Teshome, an economist at PNC Financial Services who tracks Florida’s economy.



He said housing and consumer spending, which have led Florida’s recovery, should continue to do well.



“But we are now seeing more balanced growth, across industries both small and large,” Teshome said.



Demand for workers has continued to grow even as the statewide and regional unemployment rate has hovered around 6 percent for months.



“There has definitely been an upshift, a swing, where we are seeing more employers, even those we worked with in years past, come forward and start to hire,” said Jennifer Kochilaris, regional vice president for job placement firm Adecco USA. “That shows us the trend is continuing on the right path here in Sarasota.”



Manufacturing has been a bright spot for the region’s economy, as well.



“In this area, production is booming," said Nancee Sussman, who runs the Sarasota office of Swanson Staffing. “We are seeing them starting second and third shifts, which is good.”



Construction, too, has come back significantly.



Home builders are finding workers “are not available in this area in the quantities that we need,” said Alan Anderson, executive vice president of the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association. “Electricians, dry-wallers, HVAC, plumbers. There are some framing concerns as well.”



Local builders are having a tough time competing now with other markets nationally for skilled trades, especially because so many of those workers left the region during the housing crash, Anderson said.



Florida added 32,700 construction jobs in the 12 months ended in January, more than any other state, according to data released Monday by the Associated General Contractors of America.



But 37 other states grew their construction payrolls in the year’s first month as well, the association said.



“Especially considering the fact that many parts of the country experienced very harsh weather in January, these construction jobs figures are particularly robust,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist.



In Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties, more than 23,500 residents were looking for work in January, statistics show.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent, as compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County’s rate rose by a 0.5 percentage point to 6.2 percent, from 5.7 percent.



Manatee experienced the smallest increase and had the region’s lowest jobless rate in January: 5.9 percent, as compared with 5.8 percent in December.

EARLIER: The unemployment rate in Southwest Florida climbed nearly a half-percentage point during January to 6.1 percent, likely the result of job cuts following the holiday season and more workers looking for jobs.



Unemployed workers who are not actively looking for a job are not counted in the unemployment rate. That has been responsible for part of the significant decline in the jobless rate during the recovery from the Great Recession: discouraged workers who have given up.



But evidence that more workers might be looking was found in the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity's total work force count for the region released on Monday.



There were 385,813 people counted, up nearly 1 percent, or 3,754, from the same tally in December.



The state counted 23,527 workers looking for work in January for the 6.1 percent unemployment figure. The jobless rate was 5.7 percent during December.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County rate rose 0.5 percentage points to 6.2 percent from 5.7 percent.



Manatee saw the smallest increase and had the region's lowest jobless rate during January: 5.9 percent compared with 5.8 percent in December.###2118||The fight against used video games just got a bit harder for publishers, as Walmart announced today plans to offer store credit for used game trade-ins.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, Walmart customers will be able to trade in their video games and for credit that can be used to purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will be sent off to be refurbished and made available for purchase in "like-new condition at a great low price." Walmart will distinguish between new and used games by labeling traded-in copies "Certified Pre-Owned."

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.

Given the profit associated with the used games business, it's no surprise Walmart is looking to get a piece of the pie. In its fiscal year that ended February 2, 2013, used-game products accounted for $2.4 billion in global sales for GameStop, more than 27 percent of the retailer's total sales. The big draw with used games are, of course, higher profit margins because the retailer gets to keep 100 percent of the trade-in sale. GameStop's used business represented over 44 percent of the retailers gross profit in the fiscal year.

News of Walmart planning to enter the used-games business led to GameStop shares dropping five percent.###2119||Empty###2120||Empty###2121||Empty###2122||Oh no! Page not found

However, another competitor has jumped into the video game trade-in market.

Walmart has announced their own trade-in program akin to those seen at stores like Gamestop, Best Buy, and Target. Walmart’s program will be more similar to the latter two as you can only receive Walmart gift cards, but can do the trades online. The online trader is already up and running so that you can check some of the prices of the games in your collection if you are interested.

The program is set to start on March 26 in stores, but it might not be a good idea to go in right away as the employees may have no idea what you are talking about. I know I experienced this at Target a year after they started a trade-in program, so be prepared. Walmart also revealed that they will be beginning to sell used games this summer after the trade-in program has been in effect for a little while.###2124||The Turkish prime minister has moved to silence anti-government protesters responsible for multiple demonstrations in recent weeks by blocking access to Twitter. Did he perhaps get the idea from former British Conservative MP Louise Mensch?

The decision by Islamist PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led to a fierce backlash by freedom of speech campaigners. But as Tory MP Douglas Carswell reminds us, there were similar demands from UK politicians not so long ago.

Turkish govt daft to block twitter. But do not forget that there were some folk here saying likewise after Ldn riots. — Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell) March 21, 2014

Back in 2011, when London was hit by rioting, Mensch said David Cameron should respond by closing down social media networks.

The then MP for Corby and East Northampstonshire tweeted: "Common sense. If riot info and fear is spreading by Facebook and Twitter, shut them off for an hour or two, then restore. World won't implode."

"If short, necessary and only used in an emergency, so what. We'd all survive if Twitter shut down for a short while during major riots."

The irony of using Twitter to call for Twitter to be shut down appeared to be lost on Mensch - who later went on to found her own version of Twitter called Menshn.

At the time, Cameron indicated he was prepared to look at banning people believed to be involved in organising riots from Twitter and Facebook. But he never acted on that threat.

In Turkey, Erdogan threatened to close access to Twitter in a speech on Thursday. At midnight (local time), access to the popular communication tool stopped, with PC users, confronted with a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority citing court orders, forced to use a virtual private network (VPN) to gain access to their accounts. No access was available for mobile users.

Mensch's call was for a temporary Twitter shutdown - a line echoed by Turkish president Abdullah Gul, who says he hopes his country's ban on the micro-blogging site is temporary.

The move by Erdogen comes ahead of local elections on March 30, followed by parliamentary elections, the build up to which has been dogged by allegations of fraud and corruption.###2125||The fight against used video games just got a bit harder for publishers, as Walmart announced today plans to offer store credit for used game trade-ins.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, Walmart customers will be able to trade in their video games and for credit that can be used to purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will be sent off to be refurbished and made available for purchase in "like-new condition at a great low price." Walmart will distinguish between new and used games by labeling traded-in copies "Certified Pre-Owned."

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.

With Airbnb just days from closing a large new funding round that will value the company at $10 billion, its founders are about to become billionaires.

Cofounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia will all maintain personal stakes of just over 15% of the company after the dilution of this raise, according to knowledgeable sources, which will net Airbnb between $400 and $500 million. At about a $10 billion valuation, that makes each cofounder’s personal stake in the San Francisco-based company worth just over $1.5 billion, vaulting them into the ranks of the world's youngest billionaires.

The new round, which will close in the next one to two weeks, is being led by Fort Worth, Tex.-based private equity firm TPG Capital, with a number of other investors, not all of whom are expected to sign on at once, but in tranches over time, sources tell Forbes. Airbnb declined to comment on both the round and the cofounders' personal stakes.

Don’t expect Chesky, 32, Gebbia, 32, and Blecharczyk, 30, to go buy their own Necker Island anytime soon—those riches are still largely tied to Airbnb’s future in stock, and the founders prefer to live simply. Chesky and Gebbia, who first came up with the idea for Airbnb in 2008 as Rhode Island School of Design grads transplanted to San Francisco, still live in the same apartment in the South of Market neighborhood where they started the company. Blecharczyk, who joined early that year as cofounder and CTO of what was then called Airbedandbreakfast.com, still bikes to work, according to an Airbnb insider. And much like Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick has been known to drive cabs around town, Chesky will still list his apartment on Airbnb once in a while to personally test out the local listings.

“People providing these services in many ways are entrepreneurs or micro-entrepreneurs,” Chesky said in a Forbes cover story last year. “They’re more independent, more liberated, a little more economically empowered.”

Airbnb’s become a leader of the share economy, with over 600,000 listings across 160 countries used by millions of annual guests, and 11 million in its five-year history. The company says New Year's Eve 2013 it had a record 250,000 guests in one night; a guest checks somewhere in the world each 2 seconds. While Airbnb does not disclose revenue, it takes 3% from a host’s booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.

The trio’s first funding came in 2009, when they got into famed tech incubator Y Combinator and eventually impressed founder Paul Graham as well as Sequoia Capital, who put up $600,000 in seed funds after the program. The company’s raised money from a range of Silicon Valley elite investors since Sequoia, which was joined in a Series A round by Greylock, SV Angel, and angels including Ashton Kutcher. In 2011, it raised $112 million at a valuation north of $1 billion led by Andreessen Horowitz and joined by DST and General Catalyst Partners as well as Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos. The next year, it raised $200 million in a Series C round led by Founders Fund along with its existing investments in a deal that values the company around $2.5 billion.

Now the company’s sitting on a $10 billion valuation from private equity sources. No word yet whether existing investors have re-upped in the round, but an insider tells Forbes that it's unlikely that the founder or early investors will use this new raise to cash out and gain liquidity from their positions.

By turning to private equity sources for its latest cash and lofty valuation, Airbnb’s signaling that it’s taken another critical step in the life cycle of a private tech company. For TPG, it means a foot in what could prove an extremely popular eventual public offering, possibly later in 2014, while private equity funds often come with generous valuations and dilution concerns for founders looking for guidance as they begin to consider preparing for Wall Street investors.

Airbnb’s cofounders join Dropbox cofounder Drew Houston and WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton as recent tech entrepreneurs to join the billionaire ranks. When the round closes, Blecharczyk will become among the world's youngest, a group which includes Facebookers Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz and 24-year-old Hong Kong citizen Perenna Kei.

The board will now conduct a search for a permanent CEO.

Under Steve Bennett, Symantec announced a new strategy called, "Symantec 4.0," intended to streamline the organization, cut costs, and push organic innovation. A good plan, but my guess is that things weren't moving forward as fast as the board wanted, so it decided to make a change. As an outsider, it did seem like Symantec circled the wagons, focused on internal operations, and kept its eyes off the market. Thus, the company now looking for its fourth CEO in the past five years.

So what should the next CEO of Symantec do? I'm pretty sure that Symantec's board won't be calling me to set up an interview, but if I took over as the next CEO of Symantec, I'd push the company to:

1. Become the leading provider of managed and professional security services. Managed security services are growing twice as fast as product sales while the information security skills shortage gets worse each day. This makes this a no-brainer for Symantec - it already has great services and assets here but needs a few course corrections. First, the company has to become easier to do business with and improve the overall customer experience. Second, the company needs to extend its services more aggressively and supplement managed services with more professional services feet-on-the-street. Finally, Symantec managed services is one of the best-kept secrets in the industry. Symantec needs to put some marketing dough behind this effort to gain visibility and brand recognition.

2. Get active in M&A again. I get the desire for organic growth, but I really don't understand why Symantec did a 180 on acquiring companies. Yes, there were questionable moves, like buying PGP and GuardianEdge at the same time, but Symantec also had some winners such as MessageLabs, Mi5, Verisign, and Vontu. Now that the VC bourgeoisie on Sand Hill Rd. is investing heavily in security startups, Symantec should start cherry picking firms, especially those focused on advanced malware (Bit9, Bromium, Cylance, Invincea) big data security analytics (Click Security, Lancope, LogRhythm, etc.), and cloud security (CloudPassage, HyTrust, SkyHigh Networks, etc.). Symantec could also double down on Identity and Access Management by grabbing Courion.

3. Streamline, streamline, streamline. Symantec has been a company with too many products, too many contract types, too many sales teams, etc. In spite of all of this variety and volume, the company's financial success always rides on the back of less than ten products such as backup, endpoint security software, SSL certificates, and email security. Steve Bennett recognized this issue and deserves credit for starting the winnowing process but the next CEO has to put his or her foot on the gas and make the tough decisions. Should Symantec divest Altiris (I would say yes)? Should it back out of the MDM market (ditto)? Should it create separate LOBs for storage and security (tough one but yes again)? Symantec needs to follow a GE-type product matrix strategy by investing in successful and promising product areas and get out of all others.

4. Build a cybersecurity architecture and ecosystem. IBM, McAfee, and Trend Micro are pushing hard to create an integrated cybersecurity architecture for emerging enterprise security requirements. Symantec gets this strategy but is a bit late to the party. To overcome this deficit, Symantec should embrace open standards, invest in enterprise software expertise and services, and become a partner nexus for leading network security vendors like Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet, Juniper, and Palo Alto Networks. To expedite this process, Symantec should become a vocal champion of open source security projects as well as standards from groups like the FIDO Alliance, Mitre, NIST, and TCG.

5. Make Symantec products and services easier to sell and consume. Once again, Steve Bennett was on the right track so the new CEO should follow his lead. Customers don't have the time to negotiate complex contracts or work with a multitude of sales people. Symantec needs to simplify its sales, go-to-market, and contractual processes, and hire top-tier sales people that can work with CIOs and CISOs rather than network administrators. This strategy should also extend to the channel to enable partner success.

6. Establish Symantec as a center-of-excellence for talented employees. While Symantec recruited a number of new executives under Steve Bennett's tenure, it also experienced a serious brain drain of frustrated engineers and managers. For example, Symantec followed a cookie-cutter (and multi-million dollar) plan from Bain, fired a number of senior engineering talent and replaced them with junior people working overseas. This move may have been financially sound but it alienated the engineering community and gave Symantec a bad reputation amongst leading security software engineers. Symantec must emulate Google and establish itself as a center-of-excellence by hiring, supporting, and resourcing the best and brightest who are passionate about making a difference in cybersecurity and data management R&D.

Okay, I may not be qualified to run a multi-billion dollar company, but I've been working with Symantec for over a decade and believe these recommendations could push the company in the right direction. Symantec is a good company with some strong products and dedicated people. Yes, there are hard decisions and difficult times ahead, but I do believe that under the right stewardship, the company could turn around quickly and prosper.###2128||###2129||US says Rossiya is 'personal bank' for more than a dozen Russian government officials and powerful business leaders

Bank Rossiya, the Russian bank best known for its close ties to top Kremlin figures, is to be "frozen out of the dollar", according to US officials, as part of the new wave of sanctions from Washington.

Shortly after Barack Obama signed off the measures on Thursday it emerged that rating agency Standard & Poors had warned on the outlook for the Russian economy amid escalating tensions over Ukraine.

"Heightened geopolitical risk and the prospect of US and EU economic sanctions following Russia's incorporation of Crimea could reduce the flow of potential investment, trigger rising capital outflows, and further weaken Russia's already deteriorating economic performance," S&P analysts said.

The remarks were made in anticipation of EU and US sanctions, but before the announcement of actions from the US Treasury Department, targeting 20 more Russian citizens and the nation's 17th largest bank with US asset freezes.

"This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy. However, Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community," Obama said.

US officials said the St Petersburg lender was "the personal bank" for more than a dozen Russian government officials and powerful business leaders deemed to be members of Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

Those identified as allegedly doing the Russian president's bidding included the bank's billionaire chairman and largest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk. They claim he acts as "personal banker for Putin", noting he has been referred to as one of the Russian president's "cashiers".

Kovalchuk reputedly forged close ties to Vladimir Putin throughout the 1990s, when Russia's president served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg. The two men still have luxury dachas near each another on Komsomolskoye lake, outside the city.

Kovalchuk is part of a dacha cooperative with other members of this upmarket lakeside community, with several other members also major shareholders in Bank Rossiya.

The bank boss, now estimated by Forbes to have a personal fortune of $1.4bn according to Forbes, helped transform the bank from a Communist party-backed enterprise into a fast-growing and, above all, well-connected bank.

As well as leading the boardroom, Kovalchuk is the largest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, owning close to 30%. Outside banking, he also has interests in a number of federal television channels and a mobile network, Tele2.

The bank has assets of about $10bn and, after its 2010 takeover of Gazenergoprombank, almost doubled in size, breaking into the top 20 of Russian lenders.

Its operations are concentrated in the north-west of Russia and around Moscow, where it is active in a wide range of saving and loan operations, with clients in oil, gas and energy. Bank Rossiya controls large insurance groups Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank has been well known for its substantial dealings with Russian gas group Gazprom. Banking analysts at Fitch Ratings have noted in the past that Bank Rossiya relied heavily on a tiny handful of customers for about 60% of its funding, some of whom also act as customers and shareholders of the bank.

According to US Treasury officials Bank Rossiya "is the personal bank for senior officials in the Russian Federation" and Kovalchuk "is also the personal banker for senior officials ... including Putin".

In their report, S&P analysts said: "In our view, there is a material risk that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could extend beyond Crimea and that violence between pro- and anti-Russian protesters could spread to other cities in Eastern Ukraine." The analysts suggested sanctions imposed by EU countries may be tempered as political leaders looked to their economic, trade and energy interests.

Initial market reactions to the Ukraine crisis have suggested investors were quick to discount fears that the dispute would have a major impact on global trade, but the fresh analysis from S&P and a second round of sanctions from Washington may prompt some to revise that view.

One US official in Washington told Reuters: "Sanctions build over time. They are very powerful. And people may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not."###2130||Empty###2131||When you think of drought, your mind might go to empty reservoirs and parched hillsides. Not necessarily declining school attendance.

But in parts of California, a lack of rain has dried up jobs — farm jobs in particular — and many families have opted to move elsewhere, often pulling their kids from school.

At some schools, this has meant less state money since school funding is based on classroom attendance.

California schools Superintendent Tom Torlakson announced Wednesday that he would exercise his power under the governor’s drought emergency declaration to stabilize funding at schools that are losing money because of lost jobs. The announcement was made in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley.

“Some impacts of the drought seem obvious as we see water levels drop while fire risks and food prices climb,” he said in a prepared statement. “But one of the less obvious impacts is happening every day in our classrooms, where empty desks reflect children whose families could no longer find work on the farms and ranches of the Central Valley.”

Ag jobs disappear when there’s less water to irrigate and fields that are normally farmed go unplanted.

In Fresno County, the state’s most agriculturally productive county, attendance at many rural schools has dropped because families of farm laborers have moved on, according to the county Office of Education.

A spokesperson said attendance records don’t specify which children have left because of the drought, and which ones moved on for other reasons, but that the trend is clear. Over the next few months, state education leaders are expected to work with local school districts to quantify the numbers of students lost to the dry weather so that the schools can be reimbursed.###2132||Empty###2133||The Royal Mint is taking on the counterfeiters by replacing the humble £1 coin – but businesses say there is a flipside

In today's budget, the UK Chancellor, George Osborne, will announce the replacement of the £1 coin from 2017 amid concerns about the current design's vulnerability to counterfeiting.

The new coin will be based on the threepenny bit that disappeared from circulation after decimalisation in the 1970s, with designers claiming it will be "the most secure in the world".

Why is it being changed?

The rounded £1 coin has been in use since 1983, with £1.5bn in circulation in March 2013, but ministers say the old technology used to make the coins makes it too easy for counterfeiters to copy. The new design will be in the same gold and silver colours as the euro and is particularly hard to copy. "With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," said Osborne.

How big a problem are fake coins?

The Royal Mint estimates that around 3% of the £1 coins are fake – which could mean more than £45m worth of counterfeit coins are in circulation. Individuals and companies are not allowed to pass on coins they know to be counterfeit, so ending up with fakes can be costly.

Will the new coin fit parking and vending machines?

Not as it stands, according to the Royal Mint. Andrew Mills, the head of circulation for the Mint, told the BBC it was "a likelihood" that the coin would not fit in machines designed for the existing £1. The new coin will not be accepted by many automated vending and ticket machines and may not fit in supermarket trolley or locker slots.

The change could prove expensive for firms and councils needing to alter parking meters, vending machines and shopping trolleys. When new, thicker 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 2012, town halls complained that the switch could cost them £5.5m.

Won't it be a similar size?

Yes. But the need to change machines may arise from the "metal composition" of the new coin, according to Jo Audley of the British Parking Association. "The current security elements built into machines are designed to measure the metal composition of the coin," she says. "So if they're considered conterfeit or the machine fails to read the composition correctly, they are rejected. At present, 4% of £1 coins used in parking meters are counterfeit. We need to to ascertain what metals are being used and how this recallibrates into the machine, and we don't know yet."

The cost of a change, if needed, will depend on what parts in the current machines need altering, and how this is rolled out across different parking schemes, but the association says all machines, of which there are around 100,000, could need changing. "A lot of companies are using cashless systems through mobile apps and credit card payments," said Audley.

If the machines are upgraded from a standard coin-operated machine to offering a cashless payments, this will push up the cost of upgrading, she added.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

What about businesses?

The cost is expected to mainly fall on firms operating around 400,000 machines – selling anything from train tickets to snacks – while payphones, fruit machines and supermarket trolleys will also have to be changed.

A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium welcomed the news but said: "It is important for industry that any potential change is effectively planned and managed in order to minimise hardware costs for business. The BRC will engage with both the government and the Royal Mint to support a smooth transition period."

John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "Small firms who deal with low-priced items are more likely to be affected by fake currency but we do have concerns about the extra costs of introducing a new pound coin. For example, small firms may have to pay out to replace machinery. But, there's no doubt counterfeit coins and notes can seriously damage small businesses. Not only are they worthless but a business could be prosecuted if it passes them on."

How much will the change cost?

The Royal Mint has not said how much it will cost to make the new coins, but it says £2m has so far been invested in developing the new security techniques used on the machines. Mills said 90% of the changes were likely to be straightforward, and cost around £10 to £12 per machine, and that cost of changing all the machines in the country is likely to between £15 and £20m.

However the British Parking Association says just changing parking machines could cost £50m. And, of course, there's also the cost to consumers of replacing all those trolley token keyrings.###2134||Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tried to downplay the expected rise in health insurance premiums last week, telling a House committee that premiums would ”go up at a smaller pace than what we’ve seen since 2010.”

Those comments are already questionable. Obamacare caused the average individual health plan premium to increase by 39% between 2013 and 2014 and the average family plan to increase by 56%, according to data provided last month by eHealthInsurance.com.

These increases surpass the average of the previous eight years combined, a consequence of the law’s actuarial requirements, taxes and fees, as well as the mandated essential benefits.

For their part, insurers are disputing Sebelius’ claim, The Hill reports. They’re expecting premiums to rise sharply in some areas of the country, perhaps double or triple, which is partially blamed on the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare exchange:

Health industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration.

[…]

“It’s pretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out … is going to lead to higher costs,” said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity. The insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange. The hikes are expected to vary substantially by region, state and carrier. Areas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.

[…]

“My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant,” said Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and current senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Hoagland said Sebelius was seeking to “soften up the American public” to the likelihood that premiums will rise, despite promises to the contrary.

Insurers are also pointing out that the age demographics are unbalanced, which will also contribute to the rise in insurance premiums, though that’s something that will be determine on a state-by-state bases, since they determine factor expected costs through the lens of individual state exchanges, not one big risk pool.

There are a couple things to consider after reading this report. First, the ripple effects in the insurance market. Assuming that premium increases do double or triple in some areas of the country, that would likely depress enrollment numbers for the 2015 open enrollment period. Insurers would, once again, readjust with higher premiums. At that point, we’re looking at a death spiral.

Though some have argued that bailout provisions would prevent a death spiral scenario in the transitional period, the fact that insurers are openly warning about very significant premium increases should speak volumes.

Remember, the individual mandate has been effectively gutted for two years. Anyone who doesn’t want to buy insurance could claim a loosely defined “hardship exemption” to avoid any tax penalties.

The other point is the electoral ramifications. Insurers will begin submitting their rates for 2015 in the next two or three months, which state insurance commissioners will have to approve. Though the next open enrollment period has been delayed until after the mid-term election, there will be countless stories about expected premium increases.

Those premium increases will receive a lot of attention in states where there are competitive House and Senate races, and that only serves to bolster Republicans’ chances of taking the upper chamber.###2135||Empty###2136||Mt. Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange, says it has found 200,000 of the 850,000 bitcoins that had gone missing and precipitated its bankruptcy in February.

In a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website, CEO Mark Karpeles said the company scanned “certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins.”

But lo and behold, the company found the equivalent of $115 million!

Bitcoins are a virtual currency that only exist as lines of code, stored on anything from cloud servers to thumb drives. These so-called wallets can be hacked, or users can simply misplace them or forget their passwords.

Mt. Gox, which started as a site for trading Magic: The Gathering playing cards, was later transformed into a bitcoin exchange and was at one time the largest such online service. In late February, however, the company announced it had lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins over several months, most likely due to theft from hackers. Of the 850,000 lost bitcoins, only 100,000 were the company’s own holdings. The vast majority was virtual currency belonging to users.

Some 650,000 bitcoins remain missing. That’s the equivalent of almost $400 million, depending on what the volatile exchange rate may be. One bitcoin currently trades for $575.

A lot of people are just pleased that these companies are being weeded out

Although the thefts at Mt. Gox and several other exchanges in recent months have reinforced a negative impression of Bitcoin, people within the crypto-currency community still overwhelmingly believe in the security of digital cash.

“Any news about bitcoin companies being hacked and people’s funds being stolen is obviously terrible, but a lot of people are just pleased that these companies – the ones with out adequate security or decent management – are being weeded out,” Emily Spaven, Managing Editor at digital currency news and information site CoinDesk, told me in an email earlier this month.

“The collapse of the bad actors enables other companies to learn from their mistakes and build systems that are stronger and more secure.”

Karpeles, in particular, had gained a reputation as a feckless manager who was lax about security as head of Mt. Gox. As Wired reports, important bug fixes would sometimes languish for weeks before they were implemented. For much of the last year Karpeles was also obsessed with building a “Bitcoin Cafe” in the lobby of the company’s Tokyo office building — an expensive and time-consuming project that never launched.

Esther Tung, a Vancouver-based bitcoin consultant, recently attended a digital currency conference in Austin, Texas, and found the mood was overwhelmingly positive about the future. This despite all the bad press, which included the circus surrounding the identity of bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.

“Most people think it’s a really good thing that Mt. Gox has gone away and declared bankruptcy and shut down. They weren’t good for the market,” she said.

Tung, co-founder of Saftonhouse Consulting Group, says the huge losses at Mt. Gox have only two possible explanations: “They were either incompetent or it was an inside job.”

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged his support on Friday for Bank Rossiya, a lender hit by U.S. sanctions which mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.

The bank and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is also one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

"Our companies will continue using the services of the bank," a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following the sanctions.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, instructed the Russian central bank to aid Bank Rossiya, if needed.

"And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand it is a medium-sized bank," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday."

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

The Russian central bank said the measures imposed by the United States would have no significant impact on the financial stability of Bank Rossiya.

"If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors," it said in a statement.

St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, the country's 15th largest in terms of assets, is chaired by Kovalchuk, a close adviser to the president. The friendship between the two men dates back to the early 1990s.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

Indiana added 4,600 net new workers, using seasonally adjusted data. Other states with the most manufacturing hiring in January were Missouri (up 2,500), Ohio (up 2,400), Minnesota (up 2,000), and New York (up 1,900).

Michigan added the most manufacturing workers over the past 13 months (up 18,100), assisted by strength in the recovering auto sector. Other states with the most net manufacturing job growth since the end of 2012 included Indiana (up 14,500), Ohio (up 10,000), Florida (up 10,000), and Wisconsin.

North Dakota continues to have the lowest unemployment rate in the country (2.6 percent), followed by Nebraska (3.5 percent), South Dakota (3.6 percent), and Utah (3.9 percent). North Dakota’s low unemployment rate is the result of the explosive growth in shale exploration in that state in recent years. Meanwhile, Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate in January at 9.2 percent, with Illinois and Nevada close behind at 8.7 percent each.

February sate employment numbers will be released on March 28.

Search continued in the southern Indian Ocean after sightings of debris believed to be from the plane.

In its latest update Sunday night after the conclusion of the day`s search operation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said there were no sightings of significance.

Search for missing Malaysia Airlines jet: As it happened on Sunday

"The search area experienced early sea fog particularly in the western areas, however, conditions improved during the day," it said.

A total of eight aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy`s HMAS Success supported Sunday`s search effort in a cumulative 59,000 sq km search area across two search areas within the Australian Search and Rescue Region southwest of Perth.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished mysteriously about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur March 8.

The Boeing 777-200ER was initially presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast in the South China Sea. The plane was scheduled to land in Beijing at 6.30 a.m. the same day. The 227 passengers on board included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians.

Contact with the plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1.40 a.m. when it was flying over the air traffic control area of Ho Chi Minh City.

The western boundary of the multinational current search area is around 2,500 km southwest of Perth.

Four civil ultra-long range jets chartered by AMSA and four military aircraft from Australia and the US were involved in Sunday`s search together with the HMAS Success.

Twenty State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers from Western Australia were tasked as air observers Sunday on board the civil aircraft.

"Each civil aircraft had five SES air observers on board, as well as an AeroRescue Aviation Mission Coordinator. Aerorescue is AMSA`s contracted provider of dedicated search and rescue services from locations across Australia," the AMSA said in its statement.

"The search will resume tomorrow. Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft and Japanese P-3C aircraft will join the search Monday."

Earlier Sunday, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss reiterated that the search would continue in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysian airliner as long as there was hope, Xinhua reported.

"We`re hopeful obviously for breakthroughs but these kinds of searches can take a very long time especially when they`re in remote locations as is the case in this instance," Truss said in a press conference at the AMSA here.

"We hope that soon there`ll be more information available that might help provide some kind of closure or at least an understanding of what`s happened, especially to the families of those who were on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370," said Truss.

"The search will continue and will continue as long as there`s hope, and I hope that we`ll find a time soon when we`re able to conclusively say once and for all that we are close to finding where this plane may now be located," he added.

John Young, AMSA general manager of emergency response, said searchers were Sunday hoping to find again the objects spotted by airborne observers the day before so they could be recovered and to find the objects identified in American and Chinese satellite photos.

"Today is really a visual search again and visual searches take some time. They can be difficult," Young said at the press conference.

Two Chinese Ilyushin 76 aircraft had been preparing for the operation on Sunday and would take part Monday, while Chinese warships were expected to arrive in the area Tuesday, said Young.

"China clearly has an intense interest in this search operation. I believe they had 154 people on board the aircraft," he said.

Mike Barton, chief of the AMSA Rescue Coordination Centre, said four civil and four military aircraft took part in Sunday`s search.

AMSA personnel were coordinating information gained from self-locating datum buoys with expert opinions from home and abroad to identify search areas, he told the press conference.

"We put all of that information together and any new intelligence that comes to us about satellites to formulate an area and we`ll redo it again tonight based on what observations might have occurred in today`s flying and look to go out searching again and then we`ll do it again and again until we have some sort of closure or positive sightings in the area," said Barton.

Observers Saturday identified a wooden pallet, some strapping belts of different colours and "other nondescript items", he said.

The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the airline industry, he said.

"The challenge of this search hinges around its remoteness from anywhere," said Barton.

The aircraft are operating at extreme ranges from Perth, which is the closest air field, or RAAF Base Pearce, which is up the road, and so at 2,500 km away they`re operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area, and then back again," he said.

"That`s only allowing us to get in a singular search a day which is again spreading the search out over several days."###2144||Tuesday, 06 November 2018 - 15:17

Wal-Mart announced yesterday that it will begin accepting video game trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

Wal-Mart says it wants to “shake up” the secondhand market and steal some of the increasingly dwindling market-share from competitors like GameStop.

So why trade games in at Wally-World as opposed to GameStop or Best Buy? Wal-Mart executive Mac Naughton says that traded-in games will get in-store credit that can be used on anything in the store. Including, but not limited to, bags of chips, fly threads and boogie boards, as an example.

Mr. Naughton went on to explain that the other big difference between Wal-Mart and other trade-in opportunities is that the store will “pay more than anybody else” for old games. While prices vary he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.

Here's how the program works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

[via GameSpot]###2146||Russians have a new reason to hoist a glass these days: According to a popular Russian post on Twitter, the toast du jour is “To US sanctions!”

It’s not clear whether the imbibing is due to joy or despair, but the latest round of punitive measures against Russia announced by President Barack Obama on Thursday packs a wallop.

The new sanctions add 20 individuals and one bank to the 11 already on a US blacklist. The people face travel bans and asset freezes. The bank will be unable to do business with any US firms or individuals.

The measures target President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, with the threat of more to come. Obama indicated he’s prepared to target key sectors of the Russian economy in retaliation for Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which Putin signed into law Friday.

“Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community,” the US president said.

The new sanctions certainly increase the tension between Moscow and Washington; it’s not yet clear whether they will do anything to move Russia out of Crimea or curb the Kremlin’s expansionist ambitions.

But the market is already reacting: Standard & Poor’s and Fitch credit rating agencies promptly downgraded the outlook for Russian sovereign debt from stable to negative, and Russian stock indexes plummeted in early trading on Friday.

Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported on Friday that Visa and MasterCard have stopped processing transactions for cardholders at certain Russian banks, including Bank Rossiya, the institution named in the US sanctions list.

Watch GlobalPost On Location video: Awaiting Russia’s next move at Ukraine’s eastern border

Moscow responded swiftly, imposing corresponding sanctions on nine US officials, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker of the House John Boehner.

The Russian measure was greeted with humor by some.

“I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off,” McCain said in a statement Thursday. “My Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.”

But Moscow isn’t laughing. Russia’s Foreign Ministry released a strongly worded statement saying that it was prepared to retaliate tit for tat.

“We have warned on numerous occasions that sanctions are a double-edged sword, and would come back like a boomerang to hit the United States,” read a statement released on the Foreign Ministry’s website. “Using this kind of language to speak with us is inappropriate and counterproductive, as those in Washington have had ample opportunity to observe.”

The United States does not do a great deal of trade with Russia — just $11 billion in exports and $27 billion in imports in 2013, which leaves Russia outside America’s top 20 list of trading partners.

Still, the portfolio of US companies with business interest there includes many of the world’s biggest corporations, which are watching the punitive actions closely. Some of them are lobbying for Washington to take a circumspect approach and avoid whacking too hard against what they consider the economic drivers that are modernizing Russia, the Financial Times reported. Until Thursday's sanctions, however, critics had been prodding the Obama administration, saying the US approach wasn't tough enough.

Europe’s economy, meanwhile, is more closely entwined with Russia’s.

Countries such as Germany and Italy are highly dependent on Russian gas, getting more 30 percent of their supply from Moscow. London banks hold vast amounts of Russian assets — up to $400 billion, according to some estimates. France has a more than $1 billion deal to sell warships to the Russian fleet.

That might explain why the EU is proceeding cautiously. At a summit meeting on Thursday, EU leaders said they would add 12 individuals to their original list of 21 Russians to be sanctioned, but as yet have released no names.

Moscow has some arrows in its quiver that are not specifically economic. It’s been cooperating with the US and allies on issues such as negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program and the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons stocks.

On Wednesday a top Russian diplomat threatened that Russia could change its stance on Iran if the standoff over Crimea continued.

Moscow and Washington are colleagues in the six-nation coalition in Vienna, known as P5+1, that’s trying to rein in Iran’s nuclear ambitions. If it so chooses, Russia could easily put roadblocks in the way. It could, for example, engage in an oil-for-goods barter deal with Tehran, undercutting the effects of US sanctions that many credit with getting Tehran to the negotiating table.

More from GlobalPost: As the Kremlin celebrates, Russia's liberals wallow

Speaking to the Interfax news agency, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was prepared to up the ante.

"We wouldn't like to take advantage of these negotiations [between the P5+1 group and Iran] as an element of gambling with a higher ante considering attitudes in some European capitals, Brussels and Washington," he said. "But if we are forced to do so, we will take retaliatory measures as well.”

Russian dissident Alexei Navalny is pressing the Obama administration to get tougher with Moscow. A candidate for Moscow mayor last fall, he garnered more than a quarter of the vote, but he’s currently under house arrest and his blog has been blocked in Russia.

On Wednesday The New York Times published an op-ed piece by Navalny advising the Obama administration on “how to punish Putin.”

Navalny recommends Washington widen its scope to target “the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation’s wealth.”

He goes on to name nine individuals. Five of those ended up on the Treasury Department’s sanctions list the next day.

The four who didn’t make the list include the heads of Russia’s oil and gas industries, and two oligarchs — businessmen who made quick fortunes in the massive grabathon that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.

While Obama has not ruled out measures against Russia’s energy sector, it would be a significant step to blacklist Igor Sechin, CEO of state oil company Rosneft, and Aleksei Miller, who runs the state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom, as Navalny suggests. The ripple effects could be severe, something that Obama acknowledged in his speech Thursday morning.

If the US was forced to target key sectors of the Russian economy, he said, “these sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy.”

As for the oligarchs: Roman Abramovich is the owner of the UK’s Chelsea Football Club, while Alisher Usmanov is the second largest shareholder in Arsenal, another popular soccer team. Trying to mess with British football hooligans might give even the leader of the free world pause.

March 18 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

“We know that WMT “invests in price” ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,” Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87. (Reporting by Supriya Kurane and Abhirup Roy in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Savio D’Souza)###2149||Please enable Javascript to watch this video

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Wal-Mart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards that they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.

Retail goliath Walmart is going to start allowing customers to trade-in their used video games for re-sale, taking a big bite out of a major plank of GameStop's business.

GameStop is the largest chain of video game retailers in America, and while they sell both new consoles and the latest games, buying back and then selling pre-owned games has been a vital part of their revenue. Specifically, "used products represented nearly a quarter of its $2.1 billion in sales and more than 44% of gross profit in the quarter ended Nov. 2," The Wall Street Journal reported. That might be a bit surprising for anyone who might believe that $500 consoles like the PS4 and new games that cost at $60 (not counting add-ons) drove profits for video game stores.

For Walmart cashing in on $520 million (25% of GameStop's sales) might seem like chump change. But that they have bigger reach and more customers than GameStop, which mean they could make more money.

Of course, it's not just the re-sales of old games where Walmart will clean up. Customers will receive payment in gift cards up to $35 ... that they can use at Walmart. The new trade-in program begins next week.

For their part, GameStop doesn't seem worried. (Or at least isn't pretending to be.) "We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," GameStop's Chief Executive Paul Raines said.

Walmart is planning to make a splash in the used-games business, the company announced on Tuesday.

Starting March 26, consumers can walk into more than 3,100 Walmart stores across the US and trade in games from the latest consoles, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Wii U. Customers will receive eGift cards for the value of their trade-in which can be used to purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. Walmart said customers will be able to purchase "Certified Pre-Owned" games in stores and online starting this summer.

The company joins GameStop and Best Buy, among others, offering trade-ins for video games.

Video game trade-in programs are extremely controversial. As Walmart points out, the US market for used games has hit $2 billion annually. However, game developers and publishers have railed against its growth, saying that it's effectively taking cash from their pockets.

When used games are sold back to retailers, game companies don't get a cut of the action. When they're sold at a profit, they're also left out. The games industry has lobbied for changes to that practice, but so far, those efforts have not proven fruitful.###2152||Empty###2153||The Colorado Court of Appeals issued a surprising ruling last week applying Amendment 64 retroactively to a 2011 marijuana conviction, which it threw out.

The case is important not because of the particular reversal, since the public obviously doesn’t want people punished for possessing small amounts of marijuana. Nor is the decision likely to clog the courts with thousands of demands for reversals, since the defendant’s case was unusual in that it was on appeal when Amendment 64 was approved.

But the retroactive application of the amendment is disturbing — and it’s good to see state Attorney General John Suthers saying he’s going to appeal the ruling.

As the court itself noted, “when construing a constitutional amendment, unless its terms clearly show intent that the amendment be retroactively applied, ‘we presume the amendment has prospective application only.’ ” Amendment 64 had no retroactive provision. But the court reasoned that state statute and doctrine established by the Supreme Court allow “a defendant to benefit retroactively from a significant change in the law.” And there’s no doubt Amendment 64 changed law.

Suthers counters that “well-established retroactivity law in Colorado indicates that statutory changes are prospective only unless the General Assembly or the voters have clearly indicated” otherwise.

And he worries about “the implications this ruling may have on other non-marijuana cases.”

Indeed, lawmakers could become reluctant to make major adjustments in the criminal code if they will have a cascading effect on those previously convicted.

By the way, the actual prosecution of the defendant, Brandi Jessica Russell, was hardly a miscarriage of justice. She tested for amphetamine, marijuana and methamphetamine after she and her husband took an injured baby to the hospital and the doctor grew suspicious. And the appeals court did uphold her conviction on possession of meth.###2154||Empty###2155||LOS ANGELES (CBS/AP) — The “Every Day Low Price” king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Walmart has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form of store credit.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

“You can think of the app as a post-purchase ad match. We are really making it easy in that you don’t have to look through those circulars anymore, you don’t have to know what’s on sale at another retailer,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.

Asked why Walmart doesn’t just implement the lowest price right away, Blakeman said, “This tool is in place for the chance that there is a lower advertised price out there.”

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on http://www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt.

Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. For example, in Atlanta, Walmart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General.

Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. They can redeem in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Cal State San Bernardino Marketing Professor Victoria Seitz warned consumers there’s a price to be paid for using an app like this.

“That price is your privacy. They’re going to know about your shopping habits,” she said.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart said it wants to see how competitors and customers respond to the program, but it doesn’t have any plans to add online stores to the test.

Instead of flowing into storm drains and washing out to sea, an oversized tank harvested the precious resource to keep her thirsty citrus trees and vegetables from shriveling up on dry days.

Across Santa Monica, backyard rain barrels and cisterns are becoming fashionable. Since 2010, the beach city has doled out 385 rebates to homeowners who direct rainwater back into their gardens as part of a broader effort to become water independent that also includes cleaning up contaminated groundwater and recycling water.

“This is kind of a no-brainer, low-hanging fruit solution for anyone,” said Miller, who three years ago installed a 205-gallon water storage container, which resembles an upright accordion.

California is gripped by historic parched conditions that have desiccated farmland, dried up reservoirs and forced rural communities to ration water. A welcome dousing late last month did little to break the arid spell.

Even before this latest drought emergency, some agencies that historically draw their water from the overtapped Colorado River and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta have taken steps to slash their dependence on water from outside sources and boost their own supplies. Past drought woes, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, have forced some communities to rethink where their water comes from, and they”re increasingly realizing local sources are insurance against future dry weather.

Santa Monica, population 92,000, has perhaps the loftiest goal: to completely wean itself off outside water by 2020. The city long depended on its groundwater wells, but supplies became polluted in the mid-1990s from underground gasoline storage tank leaks and the addition of a fuel additive.

The contamination forced Santa Monica to buy most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a giant wholesaler that provides drinking water to nearly 19 million people in six counties. Meanwhile, the city used proceeds from settlements with oil companies responsible for the pollution to purge the wells. The cleanup, completed three years ago, allows the city to tap groundwater for up to 70 percent of its water needs.

About 50 miles to the northwest, the semi-agricultural community of Camarillo receives about 60 percent of its water from the State Water Project — a maze of dams, pipes and canals that carries snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and transports it to points south — that it blends with salty groundwater sources.

The Southern California port city of Long Beach, which relies on outside water for 40 percent of its drinking water, studied the possibility of building a desalination plant, which separates salt from ocean water. But it was too expensive, and the city is now focused on increasing groundwater supplies.

A recent amendment to a court order deciding groundwater rights would allow Long Beach to pump more water. It”s in the very early stages of drawing up a multimillion-dollar plan to build miles of pipelines to move the water.

While maximizing groundwater is key to cutting down on distant imports, which can be fickle depending on the weather, it”s not an option for every community.

Groundwater is “not available everywhere and it also depends on the quality,” said Jennifer Persike, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. “You have to be careful not to overpump it.”

While Santa Monica bets on groundwater, it”s also investing in other water conservation tactics, including recycling and rain harvesting. Near the touristy Santa Monica Pier, a water recycling plant treats excess irrigation and other urban runoff that is then used to water parks, school grounds and a cemetery.

The city also collects rain. The main library has a 200,000-gallon underground cistern that captures raindrops to water the gardens. Last year, officials installed a smaller cistern that will fill toilets at a newly built library scheduled to open next month.

Since 1997, the city code requires that new construction and remodeled homes must catch the first quarter inch of rain.

During a recent downpour in late February, Miller checked on her cistern, which she bought from a hardware store and installed by rerouting the downspout. She paid $571 for the tank, which is bolted to the side of her house for earthquake safety, and the city reimbursed her $250. As rain funneled from the roof into the beige cistern, water from neighboring houses coursed down the street like a river.

Though Miller”s yard consists mostly of cactus and succulents — she”s in the process of ripping up the last patch of grass — there are orange, lemon and kumquat trees, and a small vegetable bed of green beans, sweet peas and snap peas that need water. A full tank typically can last for months, allowing Miller to tend to her water-needy trees and vegetables on rainless days.

While rainwater capture does little to affect the water table, it does reduce potable water demand.

“I don”t think it”s as dramatic as buying an electric car, but if everyone in LA did it, imagine the water savings there would be,” she said.

Santa Monica officials estimate that rain harvesting, low-flow toilets and other conservation measures save the city about $326,000 per year. If the city becomes self-sufficient by 2020 as planned mainly by tapping groundwater, it is expected to save $3 million per year.

“Every drop counts,” water resources manager Gil Borboa said.

California”s drought has caught the attention of foreign leaders. During a recent three-day swing through California, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Gov. Jerry Brown that the semi-arid country has no water troubles because it emphasizes desalination, wastewater recycling, irrigation that uses less water than traditional sprinklers and other measures.

Kevin Wattier, Long Beach Water Department general manager, said incentives are important, but there”s no substitute for educating people to stop watering sidewalks.

“People need to quit wasting water. It”s that simple,” he said.###2157||Licking the wounds after a visit from the biotechology bears…

Several big biotech names tumbled Friday, some more than 8%, leaving a sea of red for investors. But is the sell-off long term or just a dreary day on Wall Street?

GILD Your browser does not support iframes.

Many thought the selloff was due to Democratic lawmakers coming down on Gilead Sciences Inc. /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD over the pricing of its promising new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which is $84,000 for a 12-week treatment. Shares ended the day off more than 4% to $72.07.

But there also have been mounting worries over froth forming in the biotech sector and a possible correction on the horizon. It probably won’t be known just how meaningful Friday’s selloff was until next week, or beyond. There is one cause for concern, though, as four major biotech exchange-traded funds all lost more than 4% with many hitting historic lows.

One frequently watched gauge among ETFs, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB , dropped nearly 5% when it was all over. It was noted that the fund neared its 100-day moving average by RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.

Yee noted that “sentiment is rolling over in biotech a bit” in a note on one big name in the sector, Celgene Corp. /quotes/zigman/69584/delayed /quotes/nls/celg CELG , which lost nearly 4% to $144.40 at the close. He also noted that even though Celgene won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday for Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug, that stock crashed its 200-day moving average.

“However, we’ll state it again that the fundamentals [on Celgene] haven’t changed,” he said. Yee contends the launch of Otezla should be uneventful.

ISI Group’s Mark Schoenebaum noted data shows the drug isn’t as powerful as competing treatments but has fewer side effects and is cheaper — perhaps a strong suit considering Gilead’s pricing issues. He says although a full-year of Otezla is priced at $22,500, it still is a discount to virtually all other drugs used for the same treatment. And consensus shows it should bring in more than $1 billion in revenue by 2017.

Ten states are key to attracting Obamacare enrollees, story says###2158||iNVEZZ.com, Thursday 20 March:

Silver today tumbled to a 5-week low of $20.225 as the market fine-tuned its expectation for the start of US interest rate-tightening, following yesterday’s monetary policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee.

The Federal Reserve’s rate-setting arm yesterday announced another $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of its quantitative easing programme, tapering it to $55 billion per month. Janet Yellen, in her first FOMC meeting as Fed chair, surprised the market by indicating that the first US rate hike since the financial crisis could happen “around six months” after the end of the QE program, which she sees concluding this autumn.

If the Committee continues with its gradual $10 billion taper-steps per meeting, the asset purchases would be halted this October, which would imply that Yellen expects rate-tightening to start in April 2015. “The market isn’t pricing the first hike until August next year”, emphasizes Danske Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren.

Following the policy decision, US Treasury yields and the greenback have been on the rise, while bullion prices have been hammered from the hawkish surprise by the US central bank. It is worth noting that after the Fed had announced taper-step number two on 29 January, silver found a bottom the very next day.

However, analysts at Credit Agricole underline that the latest shift in rate-tightening expectations may turn out to be “the catalyst of a sustained rise in US Treasury yields and broad USD strength” that a lot of market participants have been expecting.

Yellen’s remarks were also backed by the Committee’s median rate path forecasts for end-2015 and end-2016, which were revised higher from 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent and from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent respectively. The FOMC also ditched the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold embedded in its forward guidance.

Right now, silver is trading at 20.321, down 1.5 percent intraday.###2159||Exclusive Free E-Book

No exact timeline was given, but the Fed's Chairman wasn't coy when asked how long the Fed would wait until after the QE tapering ends before they start to raise interest rates. Instead of reverting to type and say generic terms, Yellen actually quantified the period to "around six months" even though she wasn't pressed to give a more specific time frame. Assuming that Fed continues to cut QE purchases by $10 Billion each in the next 5 meetings, we would reach the end of QE in October, that would mean the 1st rate hike may happen during the 2015 April meeting. If the pace of decline in QE is faster, and if Yellen's 6 months is relatively flexible we could even see a rate hike at the end of 2014 or at the start of 2015. No matter how you cut it, this new guidance is earlier than the previous estimate of mid 2015.

Hence, it is not surprising to see Stock prices tanking lower heavily following this news, as market has been heavily doped up by hyper-low interest rates and the prospect of higher borrowing costs will affect traders who are using high leverage right now - and they represent a large proportion of the market if record margin debt levels shown in US exchanges are anything to go by.

Hourly Chart

S&P 500 Hourly



However, prices did not really drop that significantly. S&P 500 only shed 0.61%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower by 0.70%, while Nasdaq 100 fell by 0.64%. This is by no means the largest decline that we've seen in recent days, and the failure of risk sensitive Nasdaq 100 to fall the greatest suggest that risk appetite hasn't really disintegrated. From a price action perspective, S&P 500 remains above the 1,850 key support, and seeing how prices rebounded quickly when 1,850 was tagged, it is clear that there are bulls seeking bargain buys which will keep prices supported for now.

That being said, the failure to climb above 1,860 resistance is worrying, and right now prices are starting to head lower once again - in line with Asian stocks that are bearish right now. This suggest that a move back towards 1,850 is possible once again, but breaking below may be difficult considering that Stochastic readings should be Oversold when 1,850 is reached. Nonetheless, the support level is not invincible and should risk off appetite spread to the European session and back to US session once again it is possible for prices to go all the way back to last week's low.

Daily Chart

S&P 500 Daily

The same could be said for Daily Chart. Uptrend is still in play, echoed by Stochastic curve that is pointing higher right now. However, Stoch levels are at a "resistance zone" between 50.0 - 60.0 and it is still possible for Stoch curve to reverse here. Hence, traders who wants to play on the rebound should wait for stronger confirmation that 1,850 has held before committing heavily.

On the fundamentals side of things, it should be noted that for all the panic that Yellen's comments caused, a shift of schedule earlier by 2 months isn't really that significant in the bigger scheme of things. The largest impact it should have is on short-term speculators. As there isn't any important news today or tomorrow, the surprise hawkish talk by Yellen is expected to play on in the next 2 days. Hence, if stock prices started to show signs of bullishness today or tomorrow, the likelihood of market shrugging off Yellen's comments will be higher and we could see even stronger recovery next week if confidence is back in play.

Original post###2166||Walmart Plans To Accept Video Game Trade-Ins

(NEW YORK) - Walmart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Walmart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Walmart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.

The Obama administration has taken a red pen to its signature health care reform law again — rewriting the measure without consulting Congress.

This time, the White House wants to extend Obamacare’s “risk corridors,” which require the feds to bail out insurance companies if they lose too much money in the law’s exchanges.

Taxpayers can’t afford billions more in unchecked corporate liabilities. Rather than stroke checks to insurers to make up for the huge sums they’ll lose by participating in Obamacare’s exchanges, Congress should scrap the law altogether.

Here’s how the risk corridors work. If an insurer has to pay claims that are 3 percent more than projected, the government must reimburse the insurer for half the excess payments. If claims are 8 percent or more beyond projections, the government reimburses about 75 percent of the losses.

If costs are lower than projected, insurers are supposed to pay the government. Because estimates of Obamacare’s cost have marched steadily upward since the law passed, though, that outcome seems unlikely. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that Obamacare will cost more than $2 trillion through 2024 — more than double its initial projection.

Without the promise of a bailout, many insurers would have been reluctant to sell through the exchanges, due to the high probability of “adverse selection.” That’s the insurance-industry term for having too many old and sick customers — and not enough young and healthy ones.

If that happens, then the insurance risk pools become imbalanced. Insurers end up paying out more in claims than they receive in premiums. If the “selection” is “adverse” enough, the whole system collapses.

Insurers’ fears are increasingly looking justified.

Many Americans have had trouble enrolling because of technical problems with both federal and state exchange websites.

Meanwhile, the president has declared that the approximately 5 million Americans whose policies were cancelled because of Obamacare won’t have to pay tax penalties in 2014 designed to force them into the exchanges. The special dispensation was granted after a public outcry about the president’s promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing coverage under his health reform plan.

Younger Americans are realizing that they’re going to pay higher premiums to subsidize coverage for older Americans, even though the latter group is, on average, wealthier. For millions of young adults, remaining uninsured — whereby they can pay the individual mandate penalty of $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater, starting April 1 — will be cheaper than getting covered. So they’re staying away from the marketplaces.

A December Kaiser Family Foundation report described a 25 percent enrollment rate among 18-34 year olds as a “worst-case scenario” that could cost insurers more than half their profit margin.

That worst-case scenario is now reality. Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Avik Roy notes that “25 percent of non-elderly adults who selected an exchange plan were younger than 35,” according to January data.

Obamacare’s supporters say that they envisioned these hiccups. Indeed, the law plainly states that Obamacare “shall establish and administer a program of risk corridors for calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016” to help the exchanges outlast any growing pains.

We’re just two months into their first year, though, and the White House is already talking about extending them three more years. That means the Obama administration expects the exchanges to be financially unsustainable for at least six years after their launch.

How long are Americans supposed to wait before Obamacare starts working?

Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, isn’t willing to wait any longer. He’s looking to repeal the risk corridors. “The American people are sick of Washington picking winners and losers, especially since the chosen losers often end up being taxpayers who foot the bills for Washington’s mistakes,” said Mr. Rubio. “Eliminating Obamacare’s blank check for a bailout of insurance companies is a common-sense step to protect taxpayers when Obamacare fails.”

Obamacare is already set to cost taxpayers more than $2 trillion over the next decade. Funneling federal money to insurers through 2019 to get them to play ball on the exchanges — as the administration appears to want to do — will drive that price tag even higher. Congress should put a stop to this ill-advised bailout.

Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.###2168||Security software maker Symantec Corp (SYMC) Wednesday shunted out its Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett and named Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company did not divulge any reason for the removal of Bennett but said its priority is to find a leader who can drive propel innovation and growth at the company.

The announcement sent Symantec shares tumbling 9 percent in after-hours trade on the Nasdaq.

In a statement, Symantec said the exit of Bennett follows an ongoing deliberative process and was not due to any event or impropriety. Bennett also resigned from the Symantec board.

Symantec said a special committee of the board will begin the search for a permanent CEO.

Incoming CEO Brown joined the Symantec board after its merger with Veritas Software in July 2005.

Earlier Brown served as chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp and more recently has been a board chairman and CEO coach for firms prior to their acquisitions, including EqualLogic and Echo Nest.

Brown also will remain on the Symantec board, but will cease to serve on its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee or Nominating and Governance Committee.

Symantec reaffirmed its guidance for the fourth quarter, projecting net earnings of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share and revenue of $1.615 billion to $1.655 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $0.42 per share on revenue of $1.64 billion for the quarter.

Symantec, which makes Norton anti-virus software, has laid off workers and streamlined its to soften the impact of weak PC sales that have impacted demand for its anti-virus software. The company has been battling with falling sales for the past quarters.

Earlier this month Symantec named Thomas Seifert as chief financial officer. Seifert was previously the CFO at Brightstar and AMD (AMD).

Symantec stock closed Thursday at $20.91, up $0.33 or 1.58%, on a volume of 5.5 million shares on the Nasdaq. In after hours, the stock $1.91 or 9.11% at $19.00. In the past year, the stock has traded in the range of $20.01 - $27.10.

Business News###2169||Empty###2170||Twitter down, what next? On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###2171||Empty###2172||FTSE CLOSE: Stocks fall as US interest rate rise is planned for next year; betting and retirement firms struggle post-Budget



17.30 (CLOSE): Blue-chip shares have fallen after US Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen warned that US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.

The guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting 10 billion US dollars (£6billion) from monthly bond purchases.

It saw the FTSE 100 Index - whose constituents are heavily exposed to the American economy - fall by 30.7 points to 6542.4.

Warning: Markets have been affected by news from America that interest rates could rise next year.

The slide followed declines last night on Wall Street but in the latest session New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average was up as it recovered some of the losses.

Stock exchanges in Europe looked untroubled, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ahead.

On currency markets, the pound held firm at 1.65 US dollars and 1.20 euros.

In London, the fall-out from the Budget was also much in evidence, particularly among gambling stocks after the Chancellor increased the tax on fixed odds betting terminals from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.

William Hill initially estimated a hit of £16million over a year but increased this figure to £22million after clarification that the hike would also apply to revenues from lower-stake terminals such as fruit machines.

Shares fell 7 per cent in the wake of the Budget announcement and were off as much as 3 per cent in the latest session, wiping up £300million from its value since Tuesday night. It pared back some of the losses later to close down 4.9p, or 1 per cent, at 346.6p.

Ladbrokes, which had also dropped sharply in the wake of the Chancellor's speech, fell by a further 6.3p, or 4 per cent, to 134.1p.

The pensions industry has also been battered after the Chancellor gave retirees the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.

Friends Life owner Resolution was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, off by 5 per cent, or 16.9p, to 318.1p as it warned of the impact on new business flows in the individual annuity market.

However it insisted annuities will continue to be an important product and that overall the proposals were positive for the retirement savings market.

Legal & General steadied after an 8 per cent post-Budget fall as Shore Capital said that companies such as it and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long term as more people save.

L&G rose 1.9p to 213.1p, Aviva added 3.3p to 493.7p, Standard Life climbed 8.7p to 362.7p and the Pru gained 9.5p to 1349p.

But Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues - and lost more than half its value on Wednesday - fell heavily again, down another 13 per cent or 19p to 124p.

The biggest FTSE 100 risers were SSE, up 48p to 1486p, Standard Life up 8.7p to 362.7p, Next up 150p to 6730p and Tullow Oil up 13.5p to 780p.



The biggest FTSE 100 fallers were Resolution, down 16.9p to 318.1p, Hammerson down 20.5p to 545p, Hargreaves Lansdown down 49p to 1455p and British Land down 16p to 659.5p.



15.00: The Footsie cut its losses in midafternoon trade as US stocks put in an early rally folllowing some upbeat economic data, although the mood in global markets remained cautious after 2015 rate rise signals from Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen yesterday.



With an hour and a half of trading to go, the FTSE 100 index was down 45.4 points at 6,527.7, albeit bouncing off a session low of 6,492.6 following the positive US data.

In early deals on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 49.8 points at 16,272.0, bouncing from an opening loss and recovering some of yesterday’s triple-digit drop after being spooked by Yellen’s comments.

US rally: An early recovery by US stocks helped the Footsie cut its losses in afternoon trade

The Federal Reserve head said that the US central bank would probably end its massive bond-buying programme this autumn, and could start raising interest rates around six months later.

Lee Mumford, financial sales trader at Spreadex said: ‘Equities remained sluggish this morning as investors digested Janet Yellen’s comments last night, signalling interest rates could rise by the middle of next year.



‘The turnaround comes after Philly Fed Manufacturing data showed a jump in general business conditions, coming in at 9, far higher than the 4.2 expected,’ he added.

Other US data released earlier, however, was more mixed, illustrating the difficult choices the Fed will have to make on monetary policy.

Initial US jobless claims climbed by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 320,000 in the period of March 9 to March 15, the Labor Department said, less than the 325,000 estimate of economists.



While the Conference Board's leading economic index rose 0.5 percent in February, after a 0.1 per cent rise in January and a 0.1 per cent decline in December.

But sales of US existing homes declined 0.4 per cent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6million, the slowest pace since July 2012, the National Association of Realtors said.

13.00: A big drop by drugs group GlaxoSmithKline weighed on the Footsie at lunchtime as global stock markets took a tumble after new US Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen yesterday hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 index was down 68.1 points at 6,505.1, back close to its lowest level since early February.

A 2 per cent fall by GlaxoSmithKline, down 35.0p to 1,620.0p took the most points off the FTSE 100, after the firm disclosed that one of its experimental cancer vaccine failed in a second test.

Drug disappointment: Big falls by GlaxoSmithKline weighed on the Footsie today

The findings showed that Glaxo's MAGE-A3 therapeutic vaccine did not help patients with non-small cell lung cancer in a late-stage Phase III study.

’With a further read-out pending, we are not pinning much hope on the product,’ said Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou.

Global stocks were hit after Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen said that the US central bank would probably end its massive bond-buying programme this autumn, and could start raising interest rates around six months later.

The fall-out from the Budget was also much in evidence in London, particularly among gambling stocks after the Chancellor increased the tax on fixed odds betting terminals from 20 per cent to 25 per cent..

William Hill initially estimated a hit of £16million over a year but today increased that figure to £22million after clarification that the hike would also apply to revenues from lower-stake terminals such as fruit machines.

Shares in William Hill fell 7 per cent in the wake of the Budget announcement and were off a further 3 per cent today, down 9.65p to 341.85p and wiping £300million from its value since Tuesday night. Ladbrokes was off another 7.1p to 133.3p.



The pensions industry has also been battered after the Chancellor gave retirees the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.

Budget blues: Bookies took another tumble following tax changes in yesterday's 2014 Budget

Friends Life owner Resolution fell 14.6p to 320.3p as it warned of the impact on new business flows in the individual annuity market, although it insisted annuities will continue to be an important product and that overall the proposals were positive for the retirement savings market.

Legal & General steadied after an 8 per cent fall yesterday as Shore Capital said that companies such as L&G and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long-term as more people save.

L&G shares rose 2.7p to 213.9p, Aviva added 2.7p to 493.1p, Standard Life cheered 4.85p to 358.85p and the Pru gained 8.25p to 1347.5p.

Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues, lost more than half its value on Wednesday and was down another 6 per cent or 10.1p to 132.9p today.

The Budget's creation of a new £15,000 super ISA has been positive for shares in fund platforms and wealth managers, with St James's Place rising by another 14.7p to 880.2p today.

Also bucking the weak blue chip trend, energy supplier SSE topped the blue chip leader board with a 40.0p gain to 1,478.0p as broker Morgan Stanley raised its rating for the stock to overweight from underweight..

‘SSE is cheap versus peers ... The balance sheet is safe, we think dividends can be maintained even without energy supply profits, and EPS revisions have troughed. Capex reductions would be a positive,’ analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Broker comment also gave a boost to taxpayer owned lender Royal Bank of Scotland, up 1.7p to 303.2p.

Investec Securities raised its rating for RBS to sell from hold following a 17 per cent drop in its share price over the three weeks since the bank posted annual results.

‘RBS is a peculiar stock that, in our view, has a recurring tendency to benefit from irrational exuberance between financial reporting. Partly for this reason, we retain a tactical preference to be short into results, and neutral (with a positive bias) ‘in between’ when we perceive that upside risks are greater,' Investec analyst Ian Gordon said in a note.

Clothing retailer Next was also a strong gainer, up 115.0p to 6,695.0p after meeting expectations with an 11.8 per cent rise in annual profit, fuelled by booming sales at its online business.

Some analysts, however, reckoned the scope for further gains in Next was limited, with the stock having jumped some 24 per cent this year.

‘We view Next as a core holding, but with the shares valued at a premium to the sector, we believe the valuation is up with events,’ analysts at Investec Securities said in a note.

9.55: Insurers came under renewed pressure on the markets today after Chancellor George Osborne torpedoed the annuity industry in the Budget.

Osborne gave pensioners the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.



Legal & General fell another 2.6p to 208.6p, despite Shore Capital arguing that yesterday's 8 per cent sell-off was overdone because companies such as L&G and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long-term as more people save.

Fed watch: New US central bank boss Janet Yellen surprised traders by suggesting an interest rate hike could come by mid-2015

Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues, lost more than half its value yesterday and was down by another 11 per cent or 14.8p to 129.4p today.

The Budget's creation of a new £15,000 super Isa has been positive for shares in fund platforms and wealth managers, with St James's Place rising by another 32p to 897.5p today.



However, Hargreaves Lansdown fell back after surging 14 per cent yesterday - it was down 36p at 1450p.

The FTSE 100 fell 45.8 to 6,527.4, with insurers dragging on the blue chip index for the second day in a row.

However, global markets have fallen across the board after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.



The guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting $10billion (£6billion) from monthly bond purchases.

The message on rates sent Wall Street lower and the US dollar higher last night, and resulted in a weak session in Asia and falls in Europe this morning.

City commentators are mulling over the impact of Yellen's comments, including whether they were intentional or a slip of the tongue due to nerves at her first news conference as Fed boss.

'Fed chair Janet Yellen spooked the markets by suggesting we could see the first hike in interest rates in the middle of 2015,' said Craig Erlam of Alpari.



'Last night was a prime example of the market hearing only what it wants to hear and ignoring all of the caveats, which more often than not make the initial statement irrelevant. This mistake has been made repeatedly in the past and it appears traders have not learned from their mistakes.



'A great example of this was former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim last May that the Fed would taper [make cuts to its stimulus programme] 'later this year', adding that this was dependent on the strength of the economic data.



'In the end, the Fed did taper in December, but investors had convinced themselves that he was hinting at September, despite the economic data at the time being below par. On this occasion they chose to ignore the caveat and a lot got burned. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself next year.



Pensions shake-up: Insurers came under renewed pressure on the markets today after Chancellor George Osborne removed the need to buy an annuity

'Another interesting point here is that many in the markets have assumed for a while that the first rise in interest rates could come as early as the middle of 2015, so these comments from Yellen are only in line with expectations.



'Maybe a lot of the drop in the indices, and dollar rally and gold dive for that matter, can be attributed to the growing number of FOMC members that saw rates rising to 1 per cent by the end of 2015.'



Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: 'As expected the Federal Reserve last night shaved another $10billion from their monthly asset purchase programme, but it was the press conference after the initial decision which caused markets to sell-off sharply when Janet Yellen in her first post meeting press conference as Fed chair suggested about the course of interest rates that unsettled markets somewhat.



'Assuming a continuation in the current pace of tapering the bond buying program looks likely to end in the fourth quarter, and in answer to a question about when interest rates might rise the Fed chief suggested that a rise in rates might come as early as the second quarter of 2015, much earlier than markets had expected.



'Whether she intended to be taken so literally is open to debate but it was enough to prompt a sharp reversal, and as such we can expect to see a lower open in Europe this morning.



'The Federal Reserve also dropped its unemployment threshold target of 6.5 per cent, following the example of the Bank of England, and said it would look at a wide range of factors before taking any decisions on when to move on rates.'



Hewson added: 'While the Fed may have intended to be dovish by downgrading growth forecasts for 2014, the fact that the committee are even speculating about raising rates just over 12 months out would suggest that they remain confident about the pace and nature of the economic recovery, despite concerns about the recent bad weather on the US economy.



'This marked change of tone from previous meetings saw stocks drop, bond yields rise along with the US dollar, which hit its highest level against the euro in two weeks in the space of an hour.



'If Janet Yellen had intended to make an impression in her first meeting as Fed chairwoman then she certainly succeeded yesterday, begging the question as to whether she intended to come across as hawkish as she did.'



Jonathan Sudaria of Capital Spreads said: 'Overnight at the Federal Open Market Committee press conference, after a very dovish statement, when pressed about rate hikes, Yellen spluttered out a date of possibly six months after the end of tapering.



'Blindly, everyone has calculated that with tapering at $10billion a month, six months after that would be mid 2015. However, this doesn’t tally with the tone of the words of the statement and one wonders if a bit of stage fright took hold of her in front of the glare of the cameras for the first time.



'After removing the 6.5 per cent unemployment threshold to allow loose monetary conditions to persist even longer, it wouldn’t make sense to then blind side markets with the threat of an imminent rate hike nearer than anyone had forecast. Expect regional Fed members to be doing the media circuit trying to finesse what she actually meant.'



8.55: The FTSE 100 opened down 30.9 points at 6,542.2, tracking a drop in global equities after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could raise interest rates much sooner than expected.

New central bank boss Janet Yellen sent US stocks and bonds tumbling after suggesting that interest rates could rise by mid-2015, pointing to a more aggressive push towards normalising the cost of borrowing than anticipated.

Yellen cut the Fed's bonding buying stimulus programme by a further $10billion to $55billion a month, and suggested it could be wound up entirely by this autumn.

Market watch: Traders were rattled by Fed boss Janet Yellen's suggestion of aggressive moves towards normalising US interest rates

The Fed sought to help the US recover from the financial crisis by launching a vast stimulus scheme, which generated plentiful cheap money that has boosted stock markets all over the world in recent years.

Its gradual withdrawal, which began last December, has prompted investors to pull money out of emerging markets and caused volatility across many other asset classes.

The US Dow Jones index slid 114 points to finish at 16,222.2 yesterday, while Japan's Nikkei fell 187 points to close at 14,224.2 overnight.

Yellen's comments were made after the European market close, but the FTSE 100 closed 32.15 points lower at 6,573.13 yesterday following the Budget.

Insurers' shares took a hit after Chancellor George Osborne's announcement that no one will have to buy an annuity in future if they don't want one.



Bookmakers slumped due to a hike in tax on fixed odds betting machines from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.

Stocks to watch today include:

NEXT: The clothing retailer met guidance with a 11.8 per cent rise in annual profit, driven by growth at its Directory internet and catalogue business.

GLAXOSMITHKLINE: The pharmaceutical company said it was disappointed by some of the results of a stage III trial for a lung cancer treatment but would continue with it as there could still be a group of patients who may benefit.

Kingsport, Tenn., USA, Mar 21, 2014 - (ACN Newswire) - Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) announced today that it has been recognized by the Ethisphere(R) Institute as a 2014 World's Most Ethical Company(R) for its efforts to continually raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior.



"Eastman is dedicated to conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest legal and ethical standards," stated David Golden, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary for Eastman. "For nearly 100 years, business ethics have been top priority for Eastman. Ethics are critical to success because they build trust and confidence in our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we work and live. Receiving this prestigious recognition further reinforces the commitment to honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior inherent in the Eastman culture."



Eastman has a number of policies and initiatives in place that allow its team members to cultivate a culture of the highest integrity and ethical standards. The company has an Office of Global Business Conduct, led by Eastman's Chief Legal Officer, which establishes the Code of Business Conduct. Globally, dedicated Eastman professionals are employed to support the company and its partners in doing business in the most ethical and compliant manner. The Code of Business Conduct outlines the laws, principles and guidelines all employees follow regarding honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior.



The company also has a third party Code of Conduct, called 'Doing Business with Eastman', which outlines the high ethical standards that Eastman expects of its business partners. Annual training on the Code of Business Conduct is required for all employees. Additionally, the 24-hour available Business Conduct Helpline provides an anonymous means for employees and business partners to report suspected violations.



World's Most Ethical Company honorees understand the correlation between ethics, reputation and daily interactions with their brand and that the award belongs as much to their associates as it does to them. Eastman is one of only three companies in the global chemical industry honored this year.



"The entire community of World's Most Ethical Companies believe that customers, employees, investors and regulators place a high premium on trust and that ethics and good governance are key in earning it," said Ethisphere's Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Erblich. "Eastman joins an exclusive community committed to driving performance through leading business practices. We congratulate everyone at Eastman for this extraordinary achievement."



The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient(TM) framework. The Ethics Quotient framework has been developed over years of effort to provide a means to assess an organization's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. The Ethics Quotient framework and methodology was determined, vetted and refined by the expert advice and insights gleaned from Ethisphere's network of thought leaders and from the World's Most Ethical Company Methodology Advisory Panel.



Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

###2181||Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ: ZION) was the one large bank which did not meet the criteria of the latest stress tests that the banks were rallying ahead of. What is interesting is that this was not baked into the cake because the rally was up 3.2% at $32.99 on Thursday.

News wires that were given access to the Federal Reserve data showed that Zions Bancorp fell short on the minimum capital levels. At the low point of a theoretical recession, Zion’s Tier 1 common ratio would be only 3.5%. The Fed wanted to see 5% as a base under that scenario.

Keep in mind that under the severe recession guidelines, it is a scenario where unemployment hits 11.25% and where GDP would be down 5%. Another focal point was for housing prices to be down by 25%.

Zions has a yield of 0.5% with a $0.04 per quarter dividend for its common stock. Even when you consider that this was raised from only $0.01 per share per quarter in 2013, this 0.5% yield is just too low to attract many investors.

Zions will reportedly resubmits its capital plans to the Federal Reserve in April. Zions was trading down 1.5% at $32.50 in the after-hours, against a 52-week range of $23.10 to $33.33.###2182||Empty###2183||Empty###2184||For the 24 hours to 23:00 GMT, GBP fell 0.26% against the USD and closed at 1.6596, after Ukraine remained firm on its view that the Crimea peninsula would continue to be part of its country, suggesting more friction with Russia. However, losses were pared after the Russian President Vladimir Putin clarified that Russia had no intention to escalate the Crimean tensions to whole of Ukraine.



Yesterday, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced the appointment of Ben Broadbent, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, as the next Deputy Governor for monetary policy, replacing Charlie Bean.



Meanwhile, in his speech yesterday, BoE Governor, Mark Carney, made a case for more power to the central bank in order to deal with future financial crises. Furthermore, he criticised the former Chancellor Gordon Brown, who focussed more on bank policy to be based on an inflation target and rubbished a consensus over the past two decades that central bankers’ primary goal should be price stability.



In the Asian session, at GMT0400, the pair is trading at 1.6595, with the GBP trading marginally lower from yesterday’s close.



The pair is expected to find support at 1.6543, and a fall through could take it to the next support level of 1.6492. The pair is expected to find its first resistance at 1.6648, and a rise through could take it to the next resistance level of 1.6702.



The currency pair is showing convergence with its 20 Hr moving average and is trading below its 50 Hr moving average.

For the 24 hours to 23:00 GMT, the USD weakened 0.42% against the JPY and closed at 101.48 as traders speculated that the Fed may abandon its 6.5% unemployment target which it uses as a benchmark for its interest rate policy.

Yesterday, the US Dollar was buoyed by the release of robust inflation and building permit data.

In the Asian session, at GMT0400, the pair is trading at 101.36, with the USD trading 0.11% lower from yesterday’s close.

This morning, the BoJ Board Member, Takahide Kiuchi stated that the central bank could opt for zero interest rates and phase out large-scale asset purchases if the current aggressive easing policy is successful in reaching 2% sustained inflation by 2015. Furthermore, he warned that any additional quantitative easing would entail risks and then it would be quite difficult to reverse the policies. Additionally, he noted that the Japan’s exports would continue to remain weak as China’s manufacturing sector is slowing and other emerging countries still suffering from economic imbalances.

On the macro front, the Ministry of Finance reported that Japan’s merchandise (total) trade deficit narrowed to ¥800.3 billion in February, from a revised deficit of ¥2791.7 billion recorded in the previous month. Markets had expected Japan’s merchandise (total) trade deficit to narrow to ¥600.9 billion in February.

Additionally, the Cabinet Office of Japan reported that final leading economic index in Japan rose to a level of 113.1 in January, higher than the flash estimate of 112.2, while the final coincident index rose to a level of 115.2 in January, compared to a revised level of 112.2 recorded in the previous month.

The pair is expected to find support at 101.13, and a fall through could take it to the next support level of 100.90. The pair is expected to find its first resistance at 101.74, and a rise through could take it to the next resistance level of 102.11.

The program, which opened to the general public last June, is struggling to generate interest from tourists and has suffered from computer glitches and logistical problems, all of which has created the need for tens of millions of dollars in extra funding just to keep it afloat.

The bike-share program faced “a number of financial and operational challenges,” said Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Citi Bike has nearly 100,000 annual members who pay $95 for a year’s worth of unlimited 45-minute rides. But the program has generated very little interest from tourists and other short-term users.

Operated by a group called NYC Bike Share, which is itself owned by Alta Bicycle Share, Citi Bike offers 24-hour and 7-day access plans. Those plans are relatively more expensive at $9.95 for the day plan and $25 for the week plan.

Besides having a hard time attracting those customers, Citi Bike faces the problem of manually changing out batteries at the 330 docking stations located throughout the city. A subcontractor was hired to do the expensive work, the Wall Street Journal reports and also notes that the program’s financial struggles have led to some layoffs.

The Citi Bike program was both widely touted and criticized during its development through 2012 and 2013.

Mayor Bloomberg championed the program as an environmentally-friendly way to help New Yorkers and its 50 million-plus annual tourists get around the city. Others have complained that the bike program is discriminatory. Alta, the program’s operator, places a 260 pound weight limit on bike riders, though officials have said that the limit will not be strictly enforced. Others have argued that the program is not easily-accessible to minority customers given the locations of the bike stations.

Bloomberg also highlighted that the program is entirely privately funded. But the Wall Street Journal notes that extra financial backing may be hard to come by given that the Citi Bike program is so closely identified with its namesake Citigroup. The bank provided $41 million in seed capital to get the program off the ground, and the 10,000 bikes all bear the company’s logo.

MasterCard is also a contributor to the program, providing payment services as well as $6.5 million in financing.

ANKARA - Blocking access to Twitter is not good for Turkey's international reputation, but doing nothing could have caused even worse repercussions, Turkey's Deputy PM Ali Babacan said Friday.

The most senior voice on economy in Turkey's ruling AK Party, Babacan told private broadcaster NTV that Turkey was left with no choice but do something to protect its people's rights of privacy.

"Sometimes you have to choose between two evils, and you choose the lesser of the two," he said referring to official telecommunications authority's decision to block access to the social media site.

He predicted that Twitter would not remain blocked in Turkey for too long and called for a solution to be reached reciprocally between Turkey and Twitter.

"There is a stark contrast between the fast progress of technology and the introduction of judicial frameworks to regulate and audit technology," Babacan said.

He noted that the decision was not a nice and agreeable one and added that sometimes this kind of ugly decisions need to be taken to protect people's rights.

Turkey's official telecommunications board TIB blocked access to Twitter on Thursday night, citing a handful of court orders as the basis for blocking its content.

Earlier, an omnibus bill introduced on February 28 made headlines in Turkey as it allowed TIB to block access to websites without prior court approval.

The market is rife with rumors that Wal-Mart will start offering store credit to customers looking to trade in their old video games. [ ] Used game sales account for 30% of GameStop’s revenues and half of the company’s gross profit.

GameStop recently reported a 7% increase in used game sales during the holiday season, driven by strong demand for previous generation used-games. [ ] The company has successfully warded off competition from Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), which entered the used game domain in 2010, but it now faces a new threat from Wal-Mart. [ ]

GameStop is expected to report earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 later this month. [ ]

See our complete analysis of GameStop

Can Wal-Mart Take Market Share From GameStop?

GameStop is the biggest video game retailer in the U.S., with more than half of the Xbox 360 and PS3 titles sold in the U.S. during the September quarter coming through the company’s stores. Wal-Mart also offers games and consoles at its stores but has so far been unable to take market share from GameStop.

Wal-Mart is well known for its low-price strategy and also offers a variety of items for shoppers, whereas GameStop offers just video games and consoles. Exchanging used games for store credit might be more lucrative for customers who are not just looking to trade in their old game for another game but can use the store credit to buy other items such as groceries or apparel. Electronics or entertainment items account for around 10% of Wal-Mart’s revenues, but it still has a market share of 15% in consumer electronics. On the other hand, Best Buy, which specializes in consumer electronics, has a market share of 22%. [ ]

However, GameStop has a loyal customer base, with over 31 million PowerUp Reward members. The company offers special deals and has built up good relations with its customers. For example, during the launch of Disney Infinity, GameStop offered customers the opportunity to pre-order over $400 worth of characters playable in the game. GameStop was also the only U.S. retailer to offer the exclusive $150 collector’s edition of Grand Theft Auto V. The loyalty of this base and the specialization in the niche video game market is GameStop’s biggest strong point, which might help it ward off the Wal-Mart threat.

Unlike Best Buy, GameStop has been relatively unfazed by the ‘showrooming’ phenomena, whereby customers go to a brick and mortar store to see a product and eventually buy from online retailers like Amazon and eBay. The company’s market share has remained largely unchanged for the last few years.

GameStop’s used game sales are highly correlated with new game sales, as the latter help replenish the company’s inventory; pre-owned game sales have consistently been around 65% of new software sales for the last four years. We expect the company to suffer a minor loss in market share, but it will still be able to gain as the new-console cycle progresses. We expect a 5% increase in used game sales through the coming years, but there is a 15% downside to our price estimate for GameStop should the growth be below 3% through the decade.

But in parts of California, a lack of rain has dried up jobs — farm jobs in particular — and many families have opted to move elsewhere, often pulling their kids from school.

At some schools, this has meant less state money since school funding is based on classroom attendance.

California schools Superintendent Tom Torlakson announced Wednesday that he would exercise his power under the governor’s drought emergency declaration to stabilize funding at schools that are losing money because of lost jobs. The announcement was made in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley.

“Some impacts of the drought seem obvious as we see water levels drop while fire risks and food prices climb,” he said in a prepared statement. “But one of the less obvious impacts is happening every day in our classrooms, where empty desks reflect children whose families could no longer find work on the farms and ranches of the Central Valley.”

Ag jobs disappear when there’s less water to irrigate and fields that are normally farmed go unplanted.

In Fresno County, the state’s most agriculturally productive county, attendance at many rural schools has dropped because families of farm laborers have moved on, according to the county Office of Education.

A spokesperson said attendance records don’t specify which children have left because of the drought, and which ones moved on for other reasons, but that the trend is clear. Over the next few months, state education leaders are expected to work with local school districts to quantify the numbers of students lost to the dry weather so that the schools can be reimbursed.###2189||Security software maker has terminated the services of its President and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such decision by the company in a span of two years.

The company, however, did not disclose the reasons for the move.

has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO with immediate effect.

"This appointment follows the termination of as the company's president and CEO and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors," said in a statement.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, it added.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman said.

Bennett was roped in to head the US-based firm in July 2012 when its then President and CEO Enrique Salem was asked to leave the company after a 19 year association with Symantec, including three years as the CEO.

"It was the board's judgement that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO," Symantec had said.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation.

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

He will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its compensation and leadership development committee or nominating and governance committee.

Board member Robert S Miller will replace Brown as the chair of the compensation and leadership development committee.###2190||Net profit of BMW Group rose by 4.5 percent to 5.34 billion euros ($7.4 billion) last year, as total revenues slipped slightly to 76 billion euros, the German luxury carmaker announced in its 2013 earnings report released March 19.

Unit sales jumped 6.4 percent to a record 1.964 million vehicles, with all three company brands - BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce - registering all-time highs, the Munich-based company said.

Noting that BMW had achieved a new sales record for the fourth consecutive year, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer told a news conference that the weakness of European markets had been compensated with higher growth in the United States and China, accounting for a share of 20 and 19 percent respectively in 2013.

Stressing BMW's principle that production must follow the market, Reithofer said that the company was currently evaluating the possibility of expanding capacity at its Spartanburg plant in the US. Moreover, production in China was planned to be revved up to 400,000 cars in the medium term, while a joint venture with Chinese carmaker Brilliance was beginning engine production in 2016. In Brazil, a new factory would go online this fall, tapping into the Latin American growth markets, Reithofer added.

Therefore, BMW was looking forward with confidence to the current fiscal year, in which the group's unit sales were expected to surpass the 2-million mark for the first time in company history.

"We also expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions," Reithofer added.

As a result of its 2013 earnings, BMW announced a higher dividend of 2.60 euros on common shares and 2.62 euros on preference shares.

uhe/mz (AP, dpa)###2191||Home-builder Lennar Corp. (LEN,LEN.B) posted higher first-quarter net earnings attributable to the company of $78.1 million, or $0.35 per share, which included a $45.9 million tax provision, compared with the prior-year profit figures of $57.5 million, or $0.26 per share, that included a $3.6 million tax benefit. On average, 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings per share of $0.28 for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude one-time items.

The firm clocked total revenues of $1.4 billion in the first quarter, up 38% from $990.24 million reported a year back, whereas 13 analysts estimated revenues of $1.28 billion. The company reported new orders of 4,465 homes, representing a 10% increase; and deliveries of 3,609 homes, which is up 13%.

Commenting on the results, Lennar's Chief Executive said: "Despite harsh weather conditions that impacted sales and construction during the quarter in some of our , we were able to achieve healthy year over year increases in both new orders and deliveries. Additionally, an 18% increase in average sales price and continued momentum from our land acquisition strategy drove gross and operating margin increases by over 300 basis points to 25.1% and 13.2%, respectively, the highest first quarter gross and operating margin in the Company's history."

Business News###2192||But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin's personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won't do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.



(Read more: Russia, West 'doomed to agree' on gas supply issues)

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations, and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes, and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)



Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPOs have been sold there. So, if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?



Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits like Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia's finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.



And then there's Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S., and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.



The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.



(Read more: Putin signs laws completing procedure to absorb Crimea into Russia)

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It's a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia's stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.



Of course, there other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign, and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it, deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That's how difficult this job is going to be.

###2193||Symantec has fired its second CEO in two years: the company's chief exec, president and former board chairman Steve Bennett was today shown the door after less than 18 months on the job.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," the company said in a statement.

"We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5 per cent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 per cent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

The language of the statement leaves little doubt about the extent of the exasperation of the board with Bennett. His position was "terminated," and he has been forced to resign his board position within the company. This compares with more moderate language when Symantec fired the last CEO Enrique Salem

Bennett's replacement, for the moment at least, is former chairman of the Symantec board Michael Brown. He is resigning his position on Symantec's Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee as part of the move.

"With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan," said the new boss.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market. By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

That last sentence shows part of the reason why Bennett was so abruptly fired. The past few years have not been happy ones for Symantec, with serious job losses at both the executive level and among the workers that have improved profitability figures, even though sales have remained fairly static.

The search will now start for a new CEO to take up the chalice of leadership of the troubled security and storage giant. Sadly for the company, John Thompson, arguably Symantec's most successful CEO, has his hands full as chairman of Microsoft's board and is not available for new "opportunities." ®

Sponsored: Following Bottomline’s journey to the Hybrid Cloud###2194||New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has called for tough regulations to tackle practices such as co-location, which he claims give high-frequency traders unfair advantages and distort the market.

Schneiderman - who has been investigating HFT practices as part of an 'insider trading 2.0' campaign - has homed in on services offered by trading venues that benefit HFT firms at the expense of other market participants.



Speaking at a symposium in New York, the attorney general highlighted the practice of allowing traders to locate their computer servers within trading venues; providing extra network bandwidth to high-frequency traders; and attaching ultra-fast connection cables and special high-speed switches to their servers.



All of these practices are designed to give clients millisecond advantages, enabling them to make trades, often risk-free, before the market has time to react.



Co-location arrangements also help HFT firms to continuously monitor all the exchanges for large incoming orders. If a firm can detect a large order from an institutional investor - like a pension fund - it can instantaneously position itself on the other side of the trade, driving up the prices artificially.



This, in turn, forces big investors into adopting complicated and expensive defensive strategies like fleeing to dark pools to conceal orders from "parasitic traders", says Schneiderman.



The attorney general is calling on exchanges and regulators to look into changes that would see orders processed in batches rather than continuously to ensure that price rather than technology-driven speed decides who obtains a trade.



"Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets are becoming too focused on catering to them...It's long past time that we focus on structural reforms to help eliminate the unfair advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders," says Schneiderman.



The attorney general has already had some success in his crusade against HFT. Last July, under pressure from him, Thomson Reuters agreed to suspend its practice of providing traders with consumer survey results a couple of seconds before the information was given to other subscribers.



Since then, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has agreed to end its practice of systematically surveying Wall Street analysts for their sentiments on firms it covers in order to obtain advance information.###2195||The stock market looked ready to finish off a turbulent week with solid gains, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 index was on track to close Friday at an all-time high.

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,882 as of 11: 30 a.m. Eastern time. If that gain holds through the close of trading, it would mark an all-time high for the index. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 119 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,451. The Nasdaq composite slipped three points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,316.

COMPARE, CONTRAST: It might sound surprising that the stock market is trading at an all-time high with all the uncertainty surrounding China’s slowing growth and simmering tensions between Russia and the West. But these concerns also highlight the relative health of the U.S. economy and stock market, said Dan Veru, chief investment officer of Palisade Capital Management in Fort Lee, N.J.

“In a perverse way, these geopolitical issues drive home the fact that the U.S. has been overlooked. The U.S. was the first major economy to go into recession, and it’s the first major country coming out of recession right now.”

COMING BACK: A week ago, the S&P 500 index turned in a 1.9 percent weekly loss, its worst slump in nearly two months. This week looks entirely different, with the S&P 500 on track to gain 2.1 percent, as concerns have eased over China’s slower economic growth.

The only stumble came Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve said it could start raising short-term interest rates as soon as next year. Traders drove down prices for gold, government bonds and stocks.

GOLDEN GATE’S TOUCH: News that Golden Gate Capital has acquired a stake in Ann Inc. shot the retailer’s stock up $5.20, or 15 percent, to $42.43. The private equity firm disclosed the 9.5 percent stake in the parent company of Ann Taylor and LOFT late Thursday.

SWOOSH: Nike fell after warning that a stronger U.S. dollar will dampen its results this quarter. Strong demand for its shoes and apparel ahead of the World Cup in June helped its beat expectations in the previous quarter, the company said late Thursday. Nike, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, lost $2.50, or 3 percent, to $76.77.

BOOTED: Symantec slumped $2.85, or 14 percent, to $18.08. The maker of security software abruptly fired its CEO late Thursday. It was the second time in less than two years that the company has dismissed its chief executive.

OVERSEAS: European indexes closed slightly higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.2 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent. Russia’s stock market sank 1.3 percent.

In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.2 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.7 percent. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

TREASURYS AND COMMODITIES: Prices for U.S. government bonds were little changed. The yield on the 10-year government was 2.77 percent. The price of crude oil rose $1.15 to $100.05 a barrel. Gold gained $5.60 to $1,336.10 an ounce.###2196||Foreign Correspondent

ISTANBUL // The decision by Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to block access to Twitter, triggered a rare public condemnation yesterday by the nation’s president, Abdullah Gul.

Mr Gul defiantly used the social-media site to criticise the restriction as unacceptable, in a development that highlighted a growing rift between two men who have shaped Turkish politics for more than a decade.

“If there have been crimes like the violation of people’s rights, only individual pages can be banned by court order,” Mr Gul said on Twitter. “I hope that this practice does not last long.”

The ban was ordered by the government’s internet agency on Thursday after what it said was a refusal by Twitter to block several tweets whose deletion had been ordered by Turkish courts. It came after Mr Erdogan said he would “rip out the roots” of the website at a campaign rally on Thursday for the March 30 municipal elections. Twitter is where leaks to recordings appeared that seemed to implicate him and other top officials in a corruption scandal, which has posed the most serious test to his 11 years in power.

The content of Mr Gul’s message – and the way it was delivered – was a message to Mr Erdogan’s religiously conservative government, observers said.

“This would certainly upset the prime minister,” said Mustafa Akyol, an author and newspaper columnist. “Disagreements are becoming harder to reconcile.”

Earlier this week, Mr Gul made the headlines by distancing himself from Mr Erdogan’s handling of a corruption scandal that has engulfed the government since last December.

Mr Erdogan has called the corruption allegations parts of a foreign plot against Turkey, but Mr Gul dismissed the prime minister’s statement as “worthy of a third world country”.

Mr Gul, 63, and Mr Erdogan, 60, both started their careers in an Islamist party later banned by the courts and are co-founders of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as well as long-time political allies.

Mr Gul served as the first AKP prime minister from late 2002 until March 2003, when he made room for Mr Erdogan and became foreign minister.

Mr Gul, who is seen as a more liberal politician than Mr Erdogan and a strong supporter of Turkey’s bid to join the European Union, was elected president in 2007 and remains highly respected within the AKP.

Analysts said Mr Gul wanted to make clear that he did not like the direction that the country was taking under Mr Erdogan.

“This is an effort to counterbalance the harm” done by the Twitter ban, Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Istanbul’s Bilgi University said. The political relationship between Mr Gul and Mr Erdogan was “slowly developing into a more open difference of opinions”.

Mr Turan said Mr Erdogan was running the risk of ruining his chances to become president in elections scheduled for August. “By his own actions, he may be disqualifying himself as a candidate”.

Some AKP ministers and members of parliament had displayed a marked “lack of spirit” in executing Mr Erdogan’s orders lately, Mr Turan said.

If the AKP was to do worse than expected in the March 30 elections, Mr Erdogan’s role as party leader could come into question, he said.

Most polls indicate the AKP, which has led the country through a massive economic boom and has pleased religiously conservative voters by ending a ban of the Islamic headscarf in state institutions, is likely to keep its position as Turkey’s strongest party with around 40 per cent of the vote in the upcoming elections.

But some polls suggest Mr Erdogan’s party could do badly in some big cities like Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.

Mr Akyol, the author, said Mr Erdogan remained popular with many conservative Turks despite the wave of protests after the Twitter ban.

“For the average Erdogan voter, the Twitter ban is not a problem,” he said.

The attempt to block to Twitter appeared to backfire with many tech-savvy users – besides Mr Gul – circumventing the ban.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors, the Associated Press reported.

The European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban – in a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.”

Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

MOSCOW — Russia conceded today that it may scrap plans to tap international markets for money this year as it counts the cost of the sanctions imposed in the wake of the annexation of Crimea.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country absorbed Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported the move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

The sanctions are already being felt on the streets of Russia as Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin’s entourage.

Russian shares continued to falter today, and the benchmark MICEX index was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month amid growing tensions between Russia and the West.

In comments carried by Russian news agencies, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov became the first Russian official to admit to an economic fallout from the sanctions.

Siluanov said the country may scrap plans to raise $7 billion worth of bonds this year if oil and gas revenues remain steady. Moscow “may decide to give up external borrowing,” he said.

The economic sanctions ordered on Thursday by President Barack Obama targeted 20 people, including Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be his lifelong friends, and also a major Russian bank that provides them support.

Two Russian banks, including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up today to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank’s. They can also get cash directly inside their banks’ branches.

Putin has ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. As well as denying he had an account there, he ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them.”

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked for his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by the U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Fitch warned that the sanctions could weigh on Russia’s economy as it followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.

Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive. Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status.###2199||Empty###2200||Empty###2201||WASHINGTON — Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state — Iowa — where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that’s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That’s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation’s job market than the employer survey did.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state’s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.

North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.

Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn’t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.

The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.

California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.###2202||Empty###2203||Today's headlines include reports about how the GOP is challenging the Obama administration's authority regarding the health law on various fronts, including the employer mandate delay and the birth control coverage mandate.

Sally Beauty Suffers Security Data Breach Of Less Than 25,000 Accounts

Another retailer is letting people know that they too suffered a security breach.

Denton, Texas-based Sally Beauty, one of the largest retailers of professional beauty products in the world, said it found a breach on March 5, which affected less than 25,000 debit and credit card accounts. The company said it was working alongside a forensics firm and the U.S. Secret Service to identify the breach.

The company said it takes this situation quite seriously. They’re working with Verizon about the matter and taking the necessary precautions and actions to deal with the issue the security incident has caused. Sally Beauty said a preliminary investigation was being handled by the Secret Service.

Breaches in personal data have been a real issue for retailers, and has shaken consumer confidence, especially after Target’s significant Thanksgiving security breach. Neiman Marcus and other retailers have said they have also suffered with data breaches during the holiday season. For Target, the breach may have curbed customer traffic.

Sally Beauty has over 2,800 stores around the world including the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. It also provides more than 6,000 professional quality products for skin, nails and hair for salon professionals and retail customers.

Online News Heard Now###2205||Backed by a court order, Turkey has clamped a ban on Twitter. Prime minister Recep Tayyib Erdogan said on Thursday before the Twitter blackout that the government now had a court order. Erdogan's government has been rocked by revelations of a scandal in social media. Erdogan declared that Turkey would eradicate Twitter and he did not care what the international community said. He added, everyone would witness the power of the Turkish Republic. Erdogan's showdown with Twitter had long been coming. In mid-2013, thousands protested against a proposed urban development of Istanbul's Taksim Gezi Park, but many said the discontent was more rooted in the government's shift away from secularism and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression. As in many countries, social media was instrumental in rallying the protesters, which included as many as 3.5 million people in a nation of 81 million. Outraged by the growing opposition to his administration, Erdogan called all social media the ''worst menace to society.'' Over the last few months, with the approaching elections social media Erdogan had become increasingly resentful and intolerant of social media. The fact, however remains that Erdogan, who doesn't follow anyone, has 4.17 million Twitter followers and has unleashed 3,043 tweets. Two weeks ago, following the release of recordings which showed someone sounding like Erdogan telling his son to dispose of a large sum of cash, the prime minister's patience snapped. Calling the recordings a ''fabrication'' he ultimately blamed social media. Turkey had in the past blocked access to YouTube, but this comes as the first ban on Twitter, which was instrumental in organising flash protests against the government last year. A lawyers' association, has meanwhile, asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. The country's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation of the court order. European Commission vice president Neelie Kroes criticised the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that was seeking to join the EU as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, voiced concern over the development. According to Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, his office was merely obeying court orders. The social network had been accused of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and he said access would be restored only when Twitter removed illegal content. He said Turkey was not a country that banned the internet.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

Ivy Ballroom, Sydney, $130pp Book Now###2209||NEW YORK (MainStreet)  Colorado's new open market for marijuana for anyone of legal age, has decidedly changed the balance of a previously hypothetical question: what would happen to the economy, crime statistics, tax base and even employment if the plant were regulated, legally sold and taxed?

Sales figures from Colorado in the first month of legal sales alone, show that financial impact will probably make the marijuana market compete if not dwarf the amount spent on alcohol by Colorado consumers in its first year out of the gate. Approximately 37 marijuana stores across the state of Colorado estimated close to $5 million in sales during their first week in business. The 30 day figures saw a whopping $14 million in profit from the same and generated $2 million in tax revenue. Sales have been so brisk, they are now on track to reach as much as $1 billion by the end of this year just in Colorado alone.

What this will mean for bank regulation is an issue now of concern if not ongoing discussions by the federal Justice Department with financial establishments in both Colorado and Washington state, expected to follow Colorado's lead in legalizing recreational marijuana sales later in the summer of 2014.

The business climate, although flying high at the moment, still has much ground to cover even as the marijuana space gains strength in motion and organizes itself along the lines of a traditional business lobby and presence.

The uncertain legal environment, if not novelty of legal sales, however, has predictably had an impact on the first joyous days of the green rush, although prices are also widely expected to drop, if not potentially the high sales tax levy on the same. The tax structure will remain in place, however, according to state legislators instrumental in crafting them, until there is a better understanding of the market.###2210||You are the owner of this article.###2211||Symantec Corp.

Business News###2212||By the end of 2013, the 13 largest pay TV providers had lost 105,000 video subscribers for the year. That marks the first year that pay TV posted an annual loss according to media analytics firm Leichtman Research Group Inc. (LRG). Total subscribers for cable, satellite, and broadband systems numbered 94.6 million.

The LRG research notes that the top nine cable TV companies lost 1.735 million subscribers in 2013 compared to 1.41 million losses in 2012. These nine companies include Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ: CMCSA), Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE: TWX), Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR), and Cablevision Corp. (NYSE: CVC). At the end of 2013 Comcast had 21.7 million subscribers, Time Warner had 11.4 million, Charter claimed 4.3 million, and Cablevision had 2.8 million. The proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner will create a behemoth with more than 34 million subscribers.

In 2013, Comcast lost 305,000 subscribers, Time Warner lost a whopping 825,000, Charter lost 121,000, and Cablevision lost 80,000. None of the nine largest cable operators gained subscribers over the 12 months.

Where are these cable viewers going? To AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), where the companies added a combined 1.46 million subscribers in 2013 and to the satellite providers DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH) which combined to add 170,000 subscribers over the year.

AT&T had 5.46 million subscribers to its U-verse broadband offering at the end of 2013 and Verizon had 5.26 million subscribers to its FiOS broadband product. DirecTV claimed 20.3 million subscribers at the end of 2013 and and Dish Network claimed 14.1 million.

According to LRG, cable providers now claim 52% of the pay TV market compared with 58% just three years ago. Comcast and Time Warner don’t fear any of their cable competitors, but the growth of broadband subscriptions does threaten what’s left of their monopoly markets. Getting bigger is their solution. We’ll have to see how that works out — if it works out.###2213||S.C. jobless rate falls to 6.4% in January

COLUMBIA, S.C. - South Carolina's unemployment went down in January for the eighth month in a row, dipping to 6.4 percent, state officials said Monday.

The drop, announced by the Department of Employment and Workforce, is down from December's jobless rate of 6.6 percent. That mark, state officials said then, was the first time in more than a decade that South Carolina's unemployment had been below the national rate.

Nationally, unemployment was 6.6 percent in January, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. South Carolina's rate was tied with four other states for 21st-highest in the nation.

In January, the number of employed people in South Carolina reached a record high of nearly 2,031,000. That's an increase of more than 22,000 people over the past year.

Nonagricultural jobs in South Carolina went down by 4,800 in January but are up by 37,000 compared with a year ago, according to state officials.

Over the last month, only two sectors - education and health services and information - posted job gains, with a total of 500 jobs. Since January 2013, those sectors are up by 5,200 jobs.

Jobless rates went up in all but three of South Carolina's 46 counties in January. Marion County had the state's highest unemployment, at 13.6 percent. Jobless rates were lowest in Lexington County, at 5.1 percent.

"Today's news is a real testament to the hard working people of South Carolina and another sign that we are continuing to move in the right direction," Gov. Nikki Haley said in a statement.

The scenario analytics tests were designed to determine if the financial institutions would be able to withstand dire conditions such as a severe drop in housing prices, 11.25 percent unemployment, as well as equity prices overall dwindling by half.

As expected, 29 of the 30 banks tested passed the first round of the Fed’s annual examination of their financial health and stability. These marks were awarded despite this year’s significant new changes that made the rigorous process more complex than in the past. For the first time, 12 medium-sized banks were evaluated along with the larger institutions, as well as the introduction of the Fed’s “severely adverse” and litigation scenarios to determine whether the top six banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs) could handle extreme domestic and international situations.

While the Fed speculated that the banks overall would lose $501 billion if faced with a severe recession and $355 billion in a less dire situation, they also concluded that the system overall is healthier and better equipped to handle a catastrophe than it was five years ago, when testing began. The only institution to fail the DFAST was Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City, falling below the 5 percent minimum Tier 1 threshold at 3.5 percent.

This was not a surprise, as the lender had already indicated that it would be resubmitting its 2014 capital plan for evaluation. All the other banks that were examined exceeded the Fed’s standards, paving the way to allow the institutions to pay back investors. Of the large banks, the top performers were New York Mellon and State Street, while the lowest ranked were Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Bank of America. Bank of America had the worst outcome of the large banks, just passing at 6 percent.

The results announced Friday were the first of two reports that will be released this month, with the more uncertain Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) outcomes expected March 26. While high marks on the DFAST signifies a bank’s ability to stay afloat, the CCAR evaluates each bank’s capital plan and its ability to be both profitable and maintain dividends during an uncertain economic outlook.

Each bank’s CCAR standards are individualized according to the institution’s balance sheet, risks, and assets, as well as its ability to pay excess capital to investors under the same adverse scenarios as put forth in the DFAST. Only after passing both tests will the Fed permit the banks to pay their investors almost $75 billion of excess capital in the form of dividend and buybacks that have accrued since 2009. Needless to say, it’s the CCAR results that the market is anticipating more.

Although Friday’s news held no surprises, next week’s results are somewhat more uncertain. There will be a greater focus on the lowest-ranking institutions, especially JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which each had to resubmit their capital plans last year. Insiders will also be paying attention to Citi’s CCAR results due to its low marks, at 7 percent, as well as February’s discovery of $360 million lost due to receivables fraud by a Mexican subsidiary, which forced Citi to resubmit its fourth-quarter financials.

Live Better” and the new online shopping tool will allow customers to do just that by seeing the competitors price before they purchase an item online.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt.

Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. For example, in Atlanta, Walmart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General.

Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. They can redeem in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Shoppers compare competitor prices so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Walmart has a long history of undercutting competitors prices, this move could not only change the way people shop, but also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart said it wants to see how competitors and customers respond to the program, but it doesn’t have any plans to add online stores to the test.

Walmart built its business on offering lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Walmart’s “every day low price” model is under attack from dollar stores and grocery stores like Kroger in addition to the Amazons of the world. On top of that, the retailer’s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

The companies U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

The fresh idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Walmart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. Last month, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don’t feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

The company declined to say when the program could be expanded nationally.

Symantec shares dropped almost 13% in early trading Friday after the antivirus and computer security company suddenly fired its CEO late Thursday.

CEO Steve Bennett was terminated by the board as "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," according to a statement by Symantec.

Investors were stunned by the move which FBR analyst Daniel Ives described as "jaw dropping" in a note to clients.

The board is setting up a search process to find a permanent replacement. Michael Brown, a board member who joined the company following Symantec's purchase of Veritas, is being installed as temporary CEO and president. Bennett had described it plan to turnaround the company in January 2013. The board of directors, though, was looking for a faster turnaround, Ives says. The company's forecast for the March quarter was below what Wall Street was looking for.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Shares were down $2.60 to $18.30 in afternoon trading.

"While we believe the company was slowly heading in the right direction," Ives says. "Last night's announcement leaves a major black-eye on Symantec."

In the internal memo obtained by CRN following the abrupt ouster of Bennett Thursday, Brown said he would take his temporary role to work closely with Symantec's leadership team and help drive the next phase of the company's transformation. Symantec, Mountain View, Calif., remains committed to creating 5 percent organic revenue growth and 30 percent operating margin targets by fiscal year 2017, Brown said. The time frame is a full three to four years since the company fired former CEO Enrique Salem. Symantec closes its fiscal year 2014 at the end of March.

Brown said Bennett led a series of successful initiatives that reorganized the company under his 4.0 strategy, unveiled last year. In a recent interview with CRN, Bennett said skeptics shouldn't count the company out. The transition disrupted 90 percent of the company's sales force, but he said the company was set to unveil future product improvements in the form of tightly integrated offerings later this year.

[Related: Expect 2014 To Be Another Transition Year For Symantec, Says CEO ]

"However, the board feels we weren't moving fast enough towards our 5 percent organic revenue growth target. Revenue growth is what's critical in building our company value," Brown said in the memo. "This decision is about finding the right leader to grow Symantec -- reflecting the board's view that Symantec has a tremendous market opportunity before us and terrific talent. Our priority going forward is to leverage our assets and talent to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and revenue growth."

The CEO search process typically takes between six and nine months, experts tell CRN. Brown in the memo addressed the ongoing senior management changes that has plagued the company over the past six months. In addition to its CFO, a longtime executive who led the company's product development and services strategy took his leave as well.

"I know that management changes can be distracting and we've had too many of them recently, but let's keep focused on delivering new products and supporting our customers," Brown said. "We have hired some great talent during the past 18 months which, combined with the team we already had in place, gives me confidence that we can accelerate our progress -- especially in building our go-to-market capability and brand, as well as investing in new product offerings."

NEXT: Read The Symantec Memo

Symantec has scheduled an "all-hands" meeting Friday and Monday for its Americas and EMEA teams. Meanwhile, Symantec partners say they are taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that Bennett's vision still comes to fruition, despite the latest upheaval. Istian Islam, a partner business manager at Unicom Government, said he met Bennett in during a public sector channel strategy session engagement last week.

"In general the meeting was positive. Some executives sometimes look like they are ready to depart, but he didn’t seem that way; he wasn't disengaged," Islam said. "As partners we've been seeing a lot of organizational changes, but the rest of the details have been in limbo, with no new certifications and training."

Bennett's organizational changes had been generally well received by financial analysts. Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza told CRN Friday that Bennett did a lot of heavy lifting, separating the sales force in a way that splits the company into its storage and core security and IT management products. It's not too far out of the question, according to Breza, for an activist on the company's board to make a move that could split away the company's storage unit. About 50 percent of the company's revenue is generated through its storage business, 25 percent through its Norton consumer endpoint security business and 25 percent through enterprise security sales.

"When it leaked that Symantec was going to buy Veritas [in late 2004], at that time it didn't make a lot of sense to anybody and it hasn't made any sense since," Breza said. "Bennett has been pretty adamant that the company wouldn't break up, but if you were looking to do so, the products are already separated and the sales force is now split more than ever before."

Following is the text of the memo Brown sent to employees:

I’m Mike Brown and want to introduce myself to you. I've been appointed Symantec's interim president & CEO. Yesterday, Steve Bennett was asked to step down as CEO and Board Member of Symantec. I know that many of our team members connected with Steve and this news may come as a surprise, so I've recorded a brief video to explain the board's decision and give you additional details. If you are unable to view the video, the message is also included below.

I will do my very best, with the support of our leadership team, to make this transition as smooth as possible for everyone. We will continue to communicate over the coming days but I encourage you to reach out to your managers and VPs with any questions or concerns you have.

Following is the message from Brown for those employees who could not view the video:

Hi, I'm Mike Brown. I've been a member of Symantec’s board since 2005 and I wanted to introduce myself to you today as I've been appointed Symantec’s interim president and CEO. Steve Bennett has been asked to step down as CEO and from the board of directors. While this announcement may seem sudden, I want to assure you that the decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative board process, and not the result of any event or impropriety.

The board recognizes Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future -- which we want to build on -- and we remain committed to our previously outlined 5% organic revenue growth and 30% operating margin targets in the FY17 timeframe. However, the board feels we weren't moving fast enough towards our 5% organic revenue growth target. Revenue growth is what's critical in building our company value. This decision is about finding the right leader to grow Symantec -- reflecting the board's view that Symantec has a tremendous market opportunity before us and terrific talent. Our priority going forward is to leverage our assets and talent to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and revenue growth.

In the meantime, we're not standing still. I'm looking forward to working closely with Symantec's leadership team to help drive the company's next phase of our transformation while the board searches for a new CEO. I know that management changes can be distracting and we've had too many of them recently, but let's keep focused on delivering new products and supporting our customers. We have hired some great talent during the past 18 months which, combined with the team we already had in place, gives me confidence that we can accelerate our progress -- especially in building our go-to-market capability and brand, as well as investing in new product offerings.

There will be an all-hands meeting tomorrow for the Americas and EMEA and Monday for APJ where you can ask questions you may have about today's announcement. Invitations will go out shortly.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called “Savings Catcher” on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.’s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for “technological answers to saving them money and time.”

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it’s hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn’t include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn’t apply to general merchandise such as clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately.

Wal-Mart’s MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don’t feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart’s focus group. She said she’s been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she’s never had time to take advantage of price matching.

“They’re doing the work for me,” said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. “The only thing they’re not doing is putting the groceries away.”###2234||The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey''s banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey''s banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

WASHINGTON - The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey's banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said an order to prevent Turks from accessing the US firm's micro-blogging site was "contrary to Turkey's own expressed desire to be a model of democracy."

"The United States supports freedom of expression in Turkey and opposes any action to encroach on the right to free speech," she told reporters.

"We urge the Turkish government to unblock its citizens' access to Twitter and ensure free access to all social media platforms."

The White House said it was "deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens' access to basic communication tools."

Washington has conveyed its concerns to the Turkish government and supports "the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies," White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

Psaki added she was not aware of any moves by the US administration to play a role in negotiations between Twitter and the Turkish government.

But she stressed that "democratic governments must accept the challenge to... listen to the voices who disagree with us."

"An independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies and crucial to ensuring official transparency and accountability," Psaki added.

As of this morning, France has now shared satellite images with Malaysian officials that point to debris in the Indian Ocean.

The images, which have not been shared with the press, show "potential objects" located in the same area where Australia and China had also found suspected debris from the plane.

Though Malaysian officials are being tight-lipped about what exactly the satellite images show, the Associated Press was told that the images were "captured Friday and pinpointed objects about 930 kilometers (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located."

These recent developments come while searchers remain in pursuit of a wooden pallet that was spotted on Saturday, but not photographed, though it cannot be confirmed that a wooden pallet was ever on the flight. When the AP contacted Malaysia Airlines for confirmation, they still hadn't responded two days later.

Wal-Mart will begin accepting video game software (not hardware) trade-ins on March 26. The company plans to pay an average of $35 per title, though trade prices will of course vary on a game-by-game basis.

According to Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia, GameStop investors need not be worried about Wal-Mart's entrance into the market. Bhatia points out that Best Buy, Target, and Amazon have all tried to enter the used game market and none have had much success.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well. However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying 1 disc at a time from customers," Bhatia said.

GameStop's competitive advantages, according to Bhatia, include 1) owning and operating its own massive refurbishment center in Texas; 2) having pricing algorithms and experience developed over the past 10 years; 3) running its own Power-Up Reward membership program. Overall, Sterne Agee continues to rating GameStop as a "BUY."

Wal-Mart will not offer any kind of membership for its used game program, at least not at launch, executives for the company said yesterday during a conference call.###2239||Empty###2240||By Agencies

The global Internet community rallied to help Twitter users in Turkey circumvent a block on the popular messaging service on Friday, as some experts said Ankara's efforts were backfiring.



After Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "wipe out" Twitter and the site went dark there Thursday, there was no lack of help from activists, Internet companies and others.



"Trying to ban Twitter has backfired," said Philip Howard, who heads the Digital Activism Research Project at the University of Washington.



"It's drawn the world's attention to the country's increasingly tough censorship and surveillance strategy."



Howard told AFP the Turkish move quickly became a "trending topic" on Twitter -- which prompted fresh criticism of the government.



"News of the ban seems to have driven more Turks to try Twitter out for the first time, breaking national records for Twitter use. Tip sheets for getting around the ban spread like wildfire," he said.



Shortly after Twitter connections were broken, the US-based social media giant posted a message reminding users they could get onto the platform through SMS text messaging.



Activists pointed to ways to tweak a computer's Internet settings to access Twitter.



And some firms offered access to their VPN -- a virtual private network which masks the user's information to circumvent the ban.



Around the world, #Turkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were big topics on the social platform.



'Flood' of tweets



Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina sociologist who is Turkish, followed the news in real time and posted a blog on how her compatriots responded.



"People circumvented, one by one, and then in a flood," she wrote.



"By the end of it all, most trending topics worldwide, and of course in Turkey, were about the blocking of Twitter, and of course, opposing it.



"Let alone be deterred, the number of tweets in Turkish and from Turkey were close to record-breaking levels."



Tufekci said Twitter has become so ingrained in daily life in Turkey that it may be impossible to hold back.



"Twitter is not just a protest tool in Turkey... it's an entrenched part of the networked public sphere," she said.



"The only people not on Twitter at the moment are ardent pro-government supporters who do not want to circumvent, and people who may not have the fairly minimal skill required to circumvent."



Some surveys suggest about one in seven Internet users in Turkey uses Twitter.



The ban on Twitter is the latest in a series of moves by Erdogan's government to tighten its control of the Internet, including banning thousands of websites.



The Turkish premier has come under mounting pressure since audio recordings spread across social media that appeared to put him at the heart of a major corruption scandal.



Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a frequent user of social media, led the chorus of calls against the ban. And activists around the world quickly denounced the Ankara government.



"The decision to block Twitter, a leading medium of communication in Turkey, is quite a dramatic step for a government that claims to be democratic," said David Kramer, president of the pro-democracy group Freedom House.



"It is a bold attempt to stop news of government corruption from getting out in the run-up to local elections. The government should immediately reopen Twitter and recognize that free, unhindered space for debate is essential in Turkey, as it is anywhere else."



Ban is 'futile'



Some activists and analysts said the ban was unlikely to succeed.



"While the ban seems futile, what it indicates is an increasingly authoritarian Turkey," said Jillian York at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.



Emily Parker, a New America Foundation fellow who has a new book on digital activism in authoritarian governments, noted that many people are able to use Twitter despite bans in countries such as China.



"Turkey may have an even harder time keeping people off of Twitter," Parker told AFP.



"Twitter is already extremely popular in Turkey, and has millions of users. It is difficult for authorities to take away Internet freedoms that people once enjoyed."###2241||Since it was first conducted in 2009, the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) for banks has been tracked quite closely by banks, lawmakers, investors and also the public at large. This is because the review process – and quite specifically the stress test conducted as a part of it – is an important tool in the financial regulator’s arsenal to ensure that the country’s financial system can withstand an extreme adverse economic scenario in the future. As these tests aim to gauge the strength of each of the country’s largest financial institutions under conditions similar to those seen during the economic downturn of 2008, they help the Fed advise individual firms about how much they need to shore up their balance sheet if necessary.

Summary results for the fourth iteration of the stress test were released by the Fed Thursday, March 20, and although the process involved 12 more financial institutions compared to last year, there was a clear improvement in overall capital conditions across the industry. [ ] All but one of the firms (Zions Bancorporation) cleared the tests.

In this article, which is the first in our series on the Fed’s stress tests and its implications for the biggest banks reviewed, we simplify the key points to put these tests in perspective and also summarize the results to help understand how the firms fare with respect to each other.

See Full Analysis for: Bank of America | Goldman Sachs | JPMorgan Chase | Morgan Stanley | Citigroup

Understanding The Test Scenario

The purpose of the stress test is to ensure that the banks have enough capital to lend to customers and businesses even under extremely trying economic conditions. The test scenario includes 28 variables (increased from 26 last year) that capture various aspects of the global economy. [ ] Of these, 16 variables relate to the domestic economy and the rest are international variables.

The main domestic variables considered as part of the supervisory scenario for the stress test are:

The U.S. unemployment rate reaches a peak of 11.25%. This figure has hovered around 6.7% over the last three months.

Equity prices witness a 50% drop compared to their value in Q3 2013.

Housing prices dip 25% by mid-2015, represented by a reduction in the house price index. The index has shown healthy quarter-on-quarter growth since early 2012.

The 12 international variables capture the impact of a fall in real GDP growth, inflation, and the U.S./foreign currency exchange rate for the four country/region blocks of the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, developing Asia and Japan.

The underlying idea that clearly emerges here is that if the financial institutions can hold their ground in such an extreme scenario, they will be well-positioned to withstand an adverse, but more probable scenario in the coming quarters.

How Did Each Financial Institution Do?

The key takeaway from the Fed’s stress test is the impact on Tier 1 common ratio for each of the 30 institutions tested under the severely adverse scenario. No doubt, each of the firms will see this benchmark figure fall from current actual values under the test conditions, but the amount it actually falls is governed by a firm’s business model, loan portfolio as well as the type of assets on its balance sheet. The table below represents the change in the Tier 1 common ratio for these firms from their current figure (circle) to their minimum level (diamond) as determined by the test.

The highlighted data point represents the combined performance of all the 30 participating firms. The 5% mark shown is the cut-off required for a firm to pass the stress test. The only bank that fails to meet this standard is Zions. Although Zions is currently in pretty good shape compared to some of its other regional competitors like PNC, SunTrust and even U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), its balance sheet is not strong enough to sustain a downturn.

There are some other interesting things to note here. Custody banks – State Street (NYSE:STT), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), Northern Trust – and card-focused lenders – Discover (NYSE:DFS), American Express (NYSE:AXP) – figure among the best-capitalized firms in the list, and are also the ones least affected by the test scenario. On the other hand, all the globally diversified banks – Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), HSBC (NYSE:HBC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) – are seen at the bottom of the list in terms of worst minimum Tier 1 common ratios as the adverse scenario shaves off between five and eight percentage points from the benchmark for these banks.

What Does This Mean For These Banks Over The Coming Year?

As the stress test incorporates any corporate actions the banks proposed to undertake over the next year – including dividends, share repurchases and major acquisitions/divestitures – a bank which passes the test is almost certain to get its capital plan approved by the Fed (unless the Fed thinks otherwise due to some qualitative factor brought to its notice). While an increase in dividends and modest share buybacks are in the cards for most of the big banks, investors would be most interested in the capital return plans Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley release on March 24, as these three banks have maintained dividends at the token figure of 1 cent since the economic downturn.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia’s southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it’s probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia’s capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."

News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.

"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.

But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don’t have -- the location of MH370."

Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).

Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.

"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.

The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.

Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."

Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.

Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.

Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.

Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association told The Associated Press.

"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.

The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.

Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane’s pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.

The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.

GameStop has gone a long time controlling the used games market, probably too long. Thankfully, a juggernaut is preparing to wage war.

Walmart has announced that it will be offering customers store credit for used games starting on March 26th. The announcement says the following:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, the more than 110 million gamers across the country will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition starting this summer. This is a new category for us and something our customers have been asking for.

GameStop has made a killing from used games, owing $2.4 billion in sales during the 2013 fiscal year. To put that in perspective, that's more than a quarter of its revenue stream. To say that GameStop executives consider used game sales an important part of the company would be an understatement.

The market has gone a long time without any proper competition. Walmart can be a serious player with its traffic, giving sellers a chance to turn their used games into store credit for more than one store (Walmart and Sam's Club).

Now that Best Buy, GameStop, and Walmart are competing for your used games, the days of being offered $20 for a one-week old game may soon be over.###2259||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

A search for a replacement is under way, it said.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said in a prepared statement.

Symantec shares fell by nearly nine percent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq to $19.09 after having closed at $20.91 during the regular session. The shares have fallen by more than 14 percent since this time last year.

Bennett is a former CEO of Intuit and a veteran GE executive. He joined Symantec in 2012 at a time when the company was seen as a fading brand on both the consumer and enterprise security fronts.

His relatively short tenure as CEO will be best remembered for a series of corporate reorganizations. Last June he instituted a significant layoff of about 1,700 employees after announcing his intent to streamline the company into 10 operating units.

His plan had been to trim between $220 million and $250 million of Symantec’s annual operating budget, he said at the time. SEC filings show that as of the nine months ended December 27, Symantec’s operating costs had declined by $133 million. At that run rate, Bennett’s reductions would have amounted to about $178 million, well short of the goal he laid out last year. Restructuring charges in the first nine months of the year amounted to $237 million.

Bennett followed up on the layoffs by naming five new executives to help initiate what he described as a shift in direction and who would lead an effort to “drive innovative thinking.”

Symantec also reiterated its guidance for the quarter ending this month, saying that it expects revenue to decline by as much as 7.6 percent year on year to between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. It said it expects earnings per share on a GAAP basis to increase to between 29 cents and 31 cents a share, up from 27 cents in the year-ago period.

Brown, the interim CEO, joined Symantec’s board after it acquired the storage company Veritas in 2005. He was previously CEO of Quantum, a $6 billion storage hard drive manufacturer that was acquired by Maxtor in 2001, which was in turn acquired by Seagate Technology in 2005.###2261||

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses a rally of his Justice and Development Party in Elazig, Turkey, Thursday, March 6, 2014. (AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici)

Continuing our series of Monkey Cage Election Reports, the following is a pre-election report on the upcoming Turkish local elections from King’s College London Ph.D. candidate Aaron Stein.

*****

On Dec. 17, swarms of Turkish police, acting at the behest of prosecutors known to have links to the Gulen movement, arrested the sons of three cabinet ministers and at least 34 others for graft. The move signaled the definitive end to the alliance of convenience between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Imam who presides over a global movement of followers dubbed the Hizmet (or Service) movement.

In response, the Gulen movement has leaked numerous audio recordings online that purportedly implicate Erdogan, his family, and many of his closest advisers in corruption. The recordings have rocked Turkish politics and have prompted Erdogan to rely heavily on nationalism, political polarization, and questionable legal tactics to frame the allegations as a massive conspiracy aimed at forcing him from power. Erdogan has since directed the bureaucracy to purge members of the police force of suspected Gulen sympathizers, sidelined the graft probe’s prosecutors, and is believed that have played a direct role in the government’s recent decision to shut down access to Twitter. In doing so, Erdogan has sought to transform the March 30 local election into a referendum on his tenure as prime minister, and, by extension, to use populist electoral tactics to absolve him of graft allegations.

To ensure that a criminal case is not pursued, Erdogan is resorting to “strongman” tactics that are eroding the foundation of Turkey’s democratic system. While the Gulenists’ use of leaked audio recordings are far from perfect, their recent actions are a reflection of Erdogan’s previous willingness to use them to advance his own political interests, regardless of the rule of law.

According to political scientist Joel S. Migdal, “strongman” leaders operating in “weak states” sometimes have an incentive to weaken the bureaucracy to ensure that rival political actors don’t accrue the tools and power needed to overthrow them. They therefore have a perverse incentive to weaken certain elements of the bureaucracy, while favoring others. Erdogan has used this tactic before, but, in a significant contrast from the present, the Turkish prime minister previously used the Gulen movement to weaken his main political enemy, the military, and other Kemalist strongholds in the bureaucracy.

The alliance has never been all that cozy and the rash of audio recordings that have since leaked clearly indicate that the Gulen movement had been making preparations to defend itself, should its alliance with the AKP falter. Nevertheless, after the 2002 election, Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Gulenists had an incentive to cooperate. The two Islamist movements, despite having different political aspirations/worldviews, had a shared incentive to further liberalize Turkish society and to curb the power of the military. And, in order to do so, both needed to gain more political power.

After the AKP narrowly avoided being closed down for alleged “anti-secular activities” in 2008, Erdogan and his allies launched a judicial counter offensive spearheaded by the same Gulen allied prosecutors who had launched the recent AKP graft raids.

The two trials, known as Ergenekon and Balyoz, were originally intended to curb the power of Turkey’s “deep state” – and by extension, the military, and other Kemalist secular strongholds like the constitutional court – but eventually grew to include well-known critics of the AKP and Gulen on trumped up charges of terrorism/coup plotting. The evidence for the Balyoz trial hinged on electronic documents that technical analysis has since shown was digitally altered. Nevertheless, the court sentenced 300 military officers to lengthy prison sentences.

Yet, while the AKP certainly succeeded in curbing the power of Turkey’s military, it did so through the use of a bureaucratic proxy that posed an indirect challenge to Erdogan’s authority. Thus, after the military had been marginalized, Erdogan soon faced a new political threat, that he himself helped create. And, like other leaders before him, he had a choice: accept the status quo and try to appease the Hizmet – which would thereby have created a non-AKP allied power center in the bureaucracy – or work to curb the movement’s influence. Erdogan opted for the latter over the former. A clash was inevitable.

To counteract the Gulenists’ influence in the judiciary and police force, Erdogan has since taken steps to bring the judiciary under his indirect control, moved to tighten the state’s control over social media, and has increased the power of Turkey’s intelligence agency – which is headed by a close political ally. Yet, just like in the case of Ergenekon and Balyoz, the tactics are at odds with established democratic procedure, and thereby erode the AKP’s stated intention of strengthening Turkish democracy.

Nevertheless, Erdogan has championed the ballot box as the final arbiter of all that ails Turkish politics. Yet, in doing so, Erdogan is practicing majoritarian politics in an increasingly polarized political climate. Thus, as Turks prepare to vote in local elections this March, an AKP victory in key cities like Ankara and Istanbul could spark further anti-government protests. To counteract such a possibility, the government is certain to take more steps to ensure that the right to peaceful protest is further encroached upon.

And, when paired with the likely leaking of more recordings, Erdogan is sure to deem it necessary to further increase his hold over the government bureaucracy. Thus, even while Erdogan appears to have calculated that increased political polarization is the key to electoral success, it has come at a steep price for Turkish democracy.

While the AKP’s poll numbers may only decrease by a few percentage points (or perhaps not change at all), it will soon be faced with the prospect of governing an incredibly fractured electorate, and a sizeable minority who may deem Erdogan to be illegitimate. The scenario suggests that Erdogan may continue to resort to the strongman tactics he has been using to try to stifle dissent, both inside the bureaucracy and on the streets. And, more broadly, how elections can have “anti-democratic” implications.###2262||The consulting arm of Denver Relief, a cannabis grower and retailer in Colorado's capital, today announced that Laura Harris, former director of the state Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED), has joined the firm as a regulatory adviser. Harris, who took over what was then the Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division in late 2011, retired last August after 30 years of working for the revenue department. In an email message that was leaked to The Denver Post, Harris said she had planned to stay at the MED until mid-2014, after the newly legal recreational pot stores were up and running, "but I found that the personal toll of this job was too much." She added that "I found that I was becoming ineffective with my colleagues at those times when it was necessary to address areas of disagreement."

When I interviewed Harris for my 2013 Reason cover story about legalization in Colorado, I found her to be refreshingly candid. Although Colorado's medical marijuana regulations were widely cited as a model for other states, she made it clear that they were largely arbitrary and difficult to enforce. She questioned the rule requiring dispensaries to grow at least 70 percent of their inventory (which applies to recreational stores until this October) and the practicality of developing child-resistant packaging for cannabis-infused foods. "The current code is extremely difficult to regulate," she said. "What you will hear from many in industry is that this works. Well I'm not as optimistic about it working. If it worked, we would be able to present evidence of how the model works toward good enforcement." This was two months before the state auditor released a report that was sharply critical of medical marijuana regulation in Colorado.

Harris, who worked as a revenue agent and a criminal investigator before becoming Colorado's chief cannabis regulator, had a pretty steep learning curve. "Even in college,," she said, "I did not partake. I can say that honestly. I had friends in law enforcement. My first husband was in law enforcement, which was the environment in which I was raised. My perception of what marijuana was when I came into this division is the little flowers in the baggie that I had seen others carry around." A year or so later, she had learned "much more about the canabis plant, much more about the theory around its medicinal effects and much more about what is actually extracted from the plants other than the flower—the resin and all the products that are created from the resin. So yes, its been very educational."

Now Harris will be educating others—not about the plant so much as the often baffling rules surrounding its use. "It's exciting to be able to bring my expertise on cannabis regulation to Denver Relief Consulting, a firm that has demonstrated a commitment to establishing a responsible model for the entire nation to follow," she says in a press release. "As more states follow Colorado's regulatory lead, both in medical and retail cannabis, it is imperative that individual governments have a framework in which to work so that there are no unintended consequences." Harris' transition is yet another sign that marijuana is becoming an industry like any other, faster than many of us anticipated.

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration published in the Federal Register new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would have to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning January 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

“Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can’t finish, we won’t shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don’t have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can’t get coverage again until next year,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare’s six-month enrollment period. Most of those bugs have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website’s capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.

DAYTONA BEACH — Supporters of the president’s health care law will make one last push on Sunday to sign people up for coverage before the March 31 enrollment deadline and are hoping for an appearance from Vice President Joe Biden to generate interest.

A variety of community groups, along with representatives from insurance carriers, will be at Halifax Health Medical Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday to guide the public through the enrollment process. Organizers have requested an appearance from Biden, but no commitments have been made.

Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said he assisted in organizing the event because he hears often from constituents who are dealing with medical emergencies and lack insurance coverage.

“The intent of the event is to ensure people in middle to lower income America have access to affordable health care,” Henry said. “We want them to be informed. This is an opportunity to enroll in insurance that will meet their needs.”

More than 100,000 people in Volusia and Flagler counties lack insurance coverage. Insurance plans in the federally run online marketplace — HealthCare.gov — are offered by private carriers. Government tax subsidies to make coverage more affordable are available for those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level — about $11,670 to $46,680 for an individual. Those without insurance will face a $95 penalty or 1 percent of their income — whichever is greater. Hardship exemptions are available.

The Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida, which received funds from a federal grant to educate the public about the health care law, has requested Biden or another “high-ranking official” appear in Daytona Beach. While first lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have touted the law elsewhere in the state, no high-ranking officials have visited locally. On Thursday, President Barack Obama visited Valencia College in Orlando to speak on women’s economic issues.

“I’ve been really trying to bang the drum for this community,” said Joyce Case, who oversees enrollment counselors called navigators for the Health Planning Council. “We are always neglected because of Orlando or Jacksonville. We have a very high number of uninsured in our community. We need it just as bad.”

Organizers would likely be given short notice if Biden or another high-ranking member of the administration decided to make an appearance, Case said. Biden recently returned to the states from a visit overseas to deal with the crisis in Ukraine, according to his public schedules.

Florida is seen as a critical state for the success of the Affordable Care Act. It has 3.8 million uninsured residents — the second highest number of any state in the nation. The health care law has met political resistance from the Republican Party in Florida. The state Legislature declined to expand Medicaid with the help of federal dollars because of opposition in the House.

As of March 1, 442,087 Floridians have selected a plan in the marketplace, according to the latest enrollment numbers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Case said she’s noticed interest has been mounting this week as the government ramps up its advertising efforts.

Mincy Pollock, who is helping to organize the event in Daytona Beach, said he hopes that number grows during the last week of enrollment.

He suspects some people are intimidated by the website and the enrollment process.

“We are trying to create an event that’s nonthreatening — sort of fun,” said Pollock, general manager of Jacksonville-based First Coast Multi-Lines Agency, an insurance broker. “We are going to hold their hands through the entire process.”

Those who miss the March 31 deadline can apply for coverage during the next open enrollment, which runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.###2265||Empty###2266||Additional Radiation Release Reported at NM Nuclear Waste Plant

iStock/Thinkstock(CARLSBAD, N.M.) — New air samples from a nuclear waste dump shut down because of a fire and release of radiation last month indicate new problems.

The sample shows that more radiation was released into the air on March 11 at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M. Officials say there is no expected health impact to workers, the public or the environment, but it is yet another problem for the site, which a report found has been suffering from lax safety regulations.

The man who managed WIPP, which takes in low-level nuclear waste from the nation’s weapons program, was replaced a week ago.

There is no timetable for re-opening the 15-year-old Department of Energy facility.

Copyright 2014 ABC News Radio###2267||HONG KONG: Hong Kong shares fell 0.30 percent on Monday as Crimea's vote to break away from Ukraine and join Russia led to threats of sanctions against Moscow by the West, fuelling geopolitical tensions.

The benchmark Hang Seng Index slipped 65.54 points to 21,473.95 on turnover of HK$55.78 billion (US$7.20 billion).

The referendum Sunday saw Crimeans overwhelmingly vote to become part of Russia, further fuelling tensions in the worst crisis between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

But while people the predominantly Russian-speaking peninsula celebrated, Ukraine's new pro-European leaders and the West branded the poll “illegal”.

The vote was organised after Russian forces seized de facto control of the region and pro-Moscow authorities took power in response to the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovych in February.

US President Barack Obama told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a phone call that it “would never be recognised by the United States and the international community”.

He said the US and its European allies were “prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for its actions”.

HSBC Global Asset Management in a note to clients: “From an investment standpoint, as the situation remains fluid, volatility will remain high in the short term across markets, especially on equities.”

China Mobile eased 1.01 percent to HK$68.8 but Macau casino firm Galaxy Entertainment surged 4.36 percent to HK$74.2.

– Chinese shares rally –

========================

Chinese shares rallied 0.96 percent after the government unveiled a plan to encourage more urbanisation.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 19.33 points to 2,023.67 on turnover of 72.0 billion yuan ($11.7 billion).

The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, jumped 2.06 percent, or 22.17 points, to 1,096.36 on turnover of 101.3 billion yuan.

The government said Sunday is will give more than 100 million Chinese vital documents making them officially residents of the country's cities under a broad plan for the urbanisation that is crucial to economic growth.

It said it will also increase public housing as part of the plan as it aims to have about 60 percent of its population living in cities by 2020, compared with 52.6 percent at the end of 2012.

The “national plan for a new model of urbanisation” also calls expanded public transport, according to the blueprint released by the State Council, or cabinet.

“Certain stocks that investors believe will benefit from reform are outperforming today,” Zhang Yuheng, an analyst with Capital Securities, told Dow Jones Newswires.

Boeing's design and manufacture of its cutting-edge 787 jetliner is safe despite the many problems encountered since the plane's rollout, according to a report issued jointly Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration and the aircraft maker.

The review concluded the aircraft was soundly designed, met its intended safety level and that the manufacturer and the FAA had effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta asked for the review after a lithium-ion battery caught fire on a 787 parked at Logan International Airport in Boston. A battery aboard another 787 failed less than two weeks later.

NEW YORK

JPMorgan said Wednesday it is selling its physical commodities business for $3.5 billion, after new regulations crimped its ability to control power plants, warehouses and oil refineries.

If approved by regulators, the deal would put the commodities business in the hands of energy and commodities trading company Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

Big banks have long profited from price swings in metals, energy and other commodities. But some had branched out into owning physical facilities as well. Last summer, JPMorgan said the possibility of new regulations on whether banks could continue to do that was a factor in its decision to sell some of its physical commodities business.

DALLAS

FedEx Corp. said its latest quarterly profit rose 5 percent from a year ago, despite storms that raised the company's costs.

The company's ground-shipping segment is doing better, but the express-delivery business is flat and customers continue to shift to slower, cheaper services for international shipments.

The quarter's results were below analysts' expectations. The weak quarter drove FedEx to lower its profit forecast for the year.

Starbucks turned its shareholders meeting into an episode of the Oprah Winfrey show on Wednesday.

The celebrity talk show host appeared on stage to announce a drink called the Oprah Chai that will be sold at Starbucks cafes starting April 29. The drink will also be available at the small chain of Teavana tea shops Starbucks recently bought.

The splashy move comes as Starbucks Corp. looks to tap into tea as a new sales driver. Starbucks cafes are still enjoying strong sales growth, but the company is also facing intensifying competition as fast-food chains and others crowd the coffee market.

Plain old Cheerios are no longer made with genetically modified ingredients, but the switch hasn't yet translated to a boost in sales.

General Mills, the company that makes the cereal, announced in January it would start making its plain Cheerios without GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. The move came after a campaign by the group Green America, which prompted fans to express their support.

On Wednesday, CEO Ken Powell said the company has gotten supportive letters and online comments for its decision but hasn't detected a sales lift.

Sources tell Reuters that the attorneys general of a number of states are working with the U.S Department of Justice to review how the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger will affect the market for broadband Internet service.

Regulators are reviewing the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger to see if it complies with antitrust laws. The number of states that have joined in the federal review isn’t know, but Indiana is reportedly conducting its own evaluation of the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger’s impact.

Comcast has said it will shed 3 million cable TV subscribers to keep its share of the pay TV market under 30% in a bid to appease regulators. The Comcast-Time Warner cable merger must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission before it can go forward.

The $45 billion Comcast-Time Warner cable merger, announced last month, has drawn criticism that it will reduce competition, translating into higher charges to consumers.

CMCSA stock fell almost 1% in Wednesday morning trading, while TWC stock slipped slightly.

More Merger News:###2272||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after “old format” wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox’s problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox’s statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn’t specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.###2273||###2274||Reuters – Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99% discount to the US price.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from US lawmakers on Friday, after US health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalised an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

“We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with US-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment – and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.###2275||Empty###2276||MAINTENANCE Sory This Site Not Available

US President Barack Obama's threat to target major sections of the Russian economy should President Vladimir Putin follow-up his annexation of Crimea with further incursions in Ukraine has caused alarm across Europe.

Denmark's foreign ministry held a special briefing for about 130 companies, including drugs firm Novo Nordisk and brewer Carlsberg, after being inundated with inquiries about the business implications of the crisis.

In an email to Reuters, Carlsberg's chief executive said he was monitoring the situation closely and would act if sanctions had a direct impact on his drinks group's business. The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia.

"Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems," said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. "Our focus is on our employees and our breweries."

Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price.

With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the west's sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked.

"We're sending the machines specially made for Russia to Russia and we are leaving the machines that we can sell in other countries here due to the risk."

Profine, a plastic window frame manufacturer with annual revenues of €700m, has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won't be able to do that forever.

"If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners," said Peter Mrosik, the German firm's managing partner.

President Obama unveiled sanctions against members of President Putin's inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally.

In response, Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Mr Obama's list.

SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating US sanctions on countries such as Iran.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals.

Germany's main trade body warned that full-blown economic sanctions would be a "real catastrophe".

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany's "wise men" council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia's importance as an energy exporter.

"What has been announced so far is really nothing. It is purely cosmetic," said a French banker based in Moscow.

"The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in US dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars," said the banker, who declined to be named.

"Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically."

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home.

But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

"It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It's very difficult to predict," said another western banker in Moscow.

"I haven't heard of any western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out."

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis has soared to over $100bn.

With that figure expected to climb, western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

Since the US and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to President Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia's state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

"We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won't annul or destroy everything we've built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented," he said on a business trip to Chile this week.###2278||This Site Is Under Construction and Coming Soon.

NOW WATCH: 11 Incredible Facts Show How Different Russia Is From The Rest Of The World###2282||Reports suggest company in advanced talks to raise nearly $500m in new funds, which would make it worth more than Hyatt and Wyndham

The online room-rental service Airbnb is reportedly close to securing a new round of funding that would value the company at $10bn – making it worth more than several leading hotel chains.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the San Francisco-based company is in advanced talks to raise between $400m and $500m with private-equity firm TPG. At $10bn, Airbnb would be one of the world’s most valuable startups and worth more than than Hyatt Hotels ($8.3bn) or Wyndham Worldwide ($9.4bn).



Founded in 2008, Airbnb allows individuals to rent out rooms, apartments and homes for short stays. The company is arguably the world’s largest hotel company, having helped set up more than 10m stays in 550,000 rooms in 34,000 cities. It added nearly 250,000 properties to its service in 2013.

Airbnb’s popularity has attracted the ire of hotel chains who claim the service allows renters to dodge lodging taxes and that the company should be regulated in the same way that they are.

New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb last October demanding information on its 15,000 hosts in the state. New York state law prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if the host is not present. The challenge came after Airbnb had pledged to work with the state to collect occupancy taxes and root out bad actors. The company is contesting the order, arguing it is unreasonably broad.

Airbnb’s valuation has quadrupled since it last raised money in 2012 at a price that valued it at $2.5bn from investors including PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Ashton Kutcher is another of the company’s early backers.

The company is part of the so-called “sharing economy” that has shaken up the taxi industry as well as the hotel industry with services like Uber and Lyft that allow people to use their own cars to freelance as part-time taxi drivers. Uber is valued at $3.8bn, following an investment last year by Google Ventures, TPG and others.###2283||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###2285||Ankara: In a tweet, Turkey's president on Friday hit out at the government ban of Twitter, as opposition leaders vowed to mount a legal challenge to the measure that came just days ahead of crucial polls.



The popular micro-blogging site, one of several that has been used to publish allegations of corruption in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inner circle, went dark in Turkey on Thursday, just hours after the embattled leader threatened to "wipe out" the social network.



The move sparked outrage from the opposition and the European Union -- which Ankara has long sought to join – as well as Erdogan's own administration.



Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a frequent user of social media, led the chorus of calls against the move. "A complete ban on social media platforms cannot be approved," he said, adding that it is not "technically possible to totally block access to platforms used all over the world".



Opposition lawmaker Aykan Erdemir said his party would take "legal action" against the ban, warning that the move would put Turkey into a league of undemocratic countries like China.



"This is an unbelievable violation of fundamental rights and freedoms," Erdemir, of the Republican People's Party (CHP), said.



European leaders said the move violated citizen's rights to freedom of speech and could threaten Turkey's bid to enter the 28-nation bloc. Ankara is already the world's top jailer of journalists, according to press freedom lobby group The Committee to Protect Journalists.



"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards," EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said in a statement.



"Social media has a vital role to play in a modern democracy. As a candidate country, EU expects Turkey to promote the values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law," tweeted Britain's embassy in Turkey.###2286||President Abdullah Gul spoke out Friday against complete bans imposed on social media platforms, placing himself at odds with Prime Minister Recep Erdogan. The split comes as Erdogan is embroiled in a corruption scandal, which could threaten the ruling party's performance in upcoming elections. Erdogan, who pushed through the Twitter ban, has said he doesn't care what the international community has to say about the measure.

However, unlike the typical video game trade-in program, Walmart is hoping to leverage its general product selection as a key advantage against GameStop, despite the world's largest retailer never referencing the specialty chain by name.

Beginning on March 26th, Walmart will expand its game trade-in program to 3100 locations across the country, while used game sales are expected to begin later this Summer both in-store and online.

The expansion will also bring a new "certified pre-owned" section to the stores and online for game trade-ins. Ironically, the program goes live today for all Walmart employees before the official public launch, while Walmart will be able to pad out their used game inventory ahead of time.

The program relies on games from all current platforms and Walmart is boasting to the media that its average credit payout per game will be at least $35, significantly more than GameStop offers for games. Of course, the kicker is that while GameStop's program is limited to buying game-related products in its stores and online portal, Walmart wants the program to drive store and online sales with gift cards loaded with store credit in exchange for games. Oddly, the program currently excludes trade-ins of consoles.

On one hand, GameStop has to sit up and pay attention to this because it could get enough traction to cut into its trade-in volume, if marketed in the right way. On the other hand, limiting the trade-in program to games with original packaging means that GameStop still has some sort of advantage for older games.

One thing I'm curious to see is how people will game the trade-in program. Would you trade in your games at Walmart over GameStop or Amazon, or do you use other methods to get rid of games you don't play anymore? Below, the first TV ad announcing the program.

Wal-Mart said its new service will allow customers to trade in games for credit they can use to shop for other goods in stores or on the company’s website, walmart.com. The program will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide.

Wal-Mart executives said the service will accept an unlimited number of games for consoles such as the Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Wii so long as they are in original packaging and undamaged. The trade-in value—which could be used to by anything from groceries to gasoline—will range from a few dollars to $35, depending on the title’s age. Customers must be 18 years or older to participate, the company said.

The retail giant is hoping to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market. Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer, told CNNMoney, the company estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” he said.

Despite the orgy ordeal that forced a comedian to vacate his Chelsea apartment, Airbnb is in talks raise money that would value the apartment rental service at an eye-popping $10 billion.

Airbnb, which counts actor Ashton Kutcher as an early backer, is in talks to raise between $400 million and $500 million from a group of investors that will likely be led by private-equity firm TPG, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Post.

At the $10 billion valuation, the San Francisco startup would be worth more than established hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide, valued at $8.45 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.

The talks are in the advanced stages, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.

Before this latest funding round, Airbnb was valued at $2.5 billion based on $326 million from financial backers, including venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Founder’s Fund.

Kutcher, Demi Moore’s ex, was named an Airbnb “strategic adviser“ after he invested in the venture in 2011.

Earlier this week, Airbnb found itself in a hot mess when Ari Teman discovered that his apartment, which had he had listed on Airbnb, had hosted a wild sex party advertised on Twitter as a “XXX FREAK FEST.”

Teman thought he was renting the pad to someone who was going to use it to host some wedding guests.

Airbnb has since put Teman up in a hotel and banned the party planner from its website. It is also discussing reimbursing him for the damage to his home.

“Airbnb has been responsive, and we are still in talks,” Teman told The Post about the bizarre episode, which he said left his furniture unusable and his clothes mysteriously damp.

Aside from the raunchy party, Airbnb is being probed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over a state law that forbids people from renting their homes for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is also present.

The AG is also concerned that some Airbnb hosts are avoiding a 14.75 percent state occupancy tax.

Schneiderman has asked for data on as many as 225,000 New Yorkers who have rented out rooms through Airbnb since 2010. The company has been fighting the data request, arguing it invades its users’ privacy.###2290||New York: The world’s major stock markets dipped while yields on the US treasuries rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve dropped the unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the US economy’s strength and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.

At the same time, the US central bank said dropping a promise to hold rates steady “well past the time” the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5% did not indicate any change in the Fed’s policy intentions.

Wall Street reacted with a modest sell-off with major indexes falling to session lows shortly after the statement from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets—the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015,” said Thomas di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.

The benchmark 10-year treasury notes yield rose 7.5 basis points to 2.753% while the 5-year notes yields surged 12 basis points to 1.67%.

The 3-year treasuries yields rose 10.5 basis points to 0.862%, the highest level since January.

In the currency market, the euro and the yen extended losses against the dollar.

The central bank proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of the US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.79 points or 0.3%, to 16,287.4, the S&P 500 lost 4.43 points or 0.24%, to 1,867.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.02 points or 0.25%, to 4,322.293.

The FTSEurofirst 300 edged down 0.03%, at 1,305.68 points, while the euro zone’s blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index was up 0.2% at 3,078.78 points. Reuters###2291||Why did this happen?

SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 18 (Reuters) - Drought-plagued California will ease some protection for fish in the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, officials said Tuesday, a move expected to make more water available for farming and ease political tensions in an election year.

The move marks a retreat from restrictions imposed earlier in the year which had widely been expected to be tightened further, rather than eased, and was welcomed in the agricultural community.

"California's agriculture is critical to the world's food supply," said assemblywoman Kristin Olsen, who represents part of the San Joaquin Valley, who had lobbied hard against the restrictions. "An inability to produce that food would clearly be devastating to health and human safety not only in California but around the globe."

Citing recent rains, regulators said Tuesday there was enough water in the state's reservoirs now to partially ease restrictions.

"We were quite concerned at that time about the issue of public health and safety," Tom Howard, executive director of the state Water Resources Control Board, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. "This really had the markings of a historic drought."

The move comes after weeks of intensive lobbying from growers, lawmakers from agricultural regions and the state's two U.S. Senators, who said the restrictions, along with the possible curtailment of water rights for some agricultural and municipal customers, would harm the state's economy.

The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of a drought that may still turn out to be one of the worst in its history despite storms that brought rain and snow last week, leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water and possibly forcing farmers to leave fallow a half-million acres (202,000 hectares) of land.

Recent storms dropped nearly a foot (30 cm) of rain in some areas, boosting reservoir levels and the snowpack that the state relies on for drinking water in the spring, but still leaving supplies way below normal for this time of year.

Earlier this month, concern that the state was about to restrict water supplies to farmers even further swept through the agricultural community, spurring intensive pushback and a series of tense meetings with water regulators in the administration of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

"We are very concerned that if the current proposal as reported to us is enacted, it will have significant near- and long-term effects on the California economy and, more importantly, will not achieve the desired water supply security intended," U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jim Costa and John Garamendi, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to the water board.

CUTBACKS STILL POSSIBLE

Under the new rules announced Tuesday, which Howard said may be modified again next month, the two massive public water projects responsible for pumping in the delta will be able to deliver it to farmers and others, once the state determines that there is enough flowing to meet the health and sanitation needs of residents.

Scott Shapiro, an attorney specializing in water issues for the Sacramento firm Downey Brand, said expanding the allowable uses of tight water supplies was not just important for farmers.

"It's not just for agriculture, because there are other needs that may be contracted for that go beyond health and safety," Shapiro said. "It could include other municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.

In addition to allowing more of the water pumped from the delta to be used for purposes other than meeting health and safety needs, the state planned to reduce by about a third the amount of water that the projects were required to leave in the delta as a way of protecting fish, Howard said during the press briefing.

But he cautioned that the state could still implement severe cutbacks to the water rights of many users if dry conditions continue.

Environmental groups, long critical of what they say is over-use of the state's limited water resources for farming in dry areas, did not immediately respond to the rules change.###2294||Toyota agrees to billion-dollar settlement with U.S. government over 'unintended acceleration' problems with some of its most popular vehicles

The deal protects Toyota executives from criminal prosecution



Justice Department lawyers investigated whether Toyota misled investigators looking into its handling of complaints of acceleration issues

General Motors currently is being investigated over similar complaints

Toyota and the federal government reportedly are about to announce a settlement to the tune of $1 billion following a Justice Department probe of how the automaker handled customer complaints about unintended acceleration the company at one point attributed to faulty floor mats.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office began investigating allegations that the Japanese automaker misled federal authorities in 2009, after complaints about the unintended acceleration became a source of controversy.

The agreement allows Toyota to avoid any potential criminal charges that could be brought against employees in the future, and requires the company to shell out a $1 billion fine.



Unintended acceleration: Toyota initially tried to resolve the issues with the cheap fix of replacing floor mats

Deal: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has slapped Toyota with a $1 billion fine for its handling of acceleration issues in some of its most popular vehicles

The agreement was first reported by CNN.

'Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years,' a Toyota spokeswoman told the cable news network. 'During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.'

Bharara's office and the Justice Department declined to comment on what for now is only a planned announcement.

For years, Toyota responded to complaints about acceleration issues in some of its most popular models by doing little more than changing floor mats.



Recall: Toyota was forced in 2009 to issue a massive recall of some of its most popular vehicles

In 2009-10, the car company was forced to recall millions of vehicles after it became clear that floor mats were not the main cause of the many cases of unintended acceleration problems.



In addition to Toyota, motor vehicle regulators were criticized for how they responded to the acceleration issues the company was having leading up to the massive recall.



Following the recall, Toyota executives were forced to appear in two Congressional hearings, at which lawmakers criticized their response to complaints regarding acceleration issues with some of the company's top-selling models.



Next: Bharara also is investigating similar claims made against General Motors

In addition to the agreement with the Justice Department, Toyota has agreed to similar settlements with state governments, as well as car owners.

The settlement with Toyota comes as the Justice Department begins a probe into safety issues with General Motors vehicles.

###2295||Empty###2296||Britain plans to replace its pound coin with a new version modelled on the country’s historic threepenny piece, finance minister George Osborne will announce later.

The new pound’s proposed 12-sided shape composed of two different coloured metals will help with efforts to crack down on fake currency, the finance ministry said.

“After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current one-pound coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” Mr Osborne said in a statement.

He will formally notify Britain’s MPs of the proposed new coin, to be introduced in 2017, as part of his annual budget announcement in parliament.

The current pound has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the finance ministry said, with about 3 per cent of all pound coins, or 45 million, believed to be forgeries. That figure rises to 6 percent in some parts of the country.

The new coin will be armed with new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology developed by the Royal Mint, the maker of Britain’s coins whose history dates back over 1,100 years.

“We think it’s suitably British,” the Royal Mint’s director of circulation Andrew Mills told BBC Radio. “It’s very reminiscent of two other British coins. The twelve-sided shape is very reminiscent of the threepenny bit and secondly, of course, it doesn’t look that dissimilar to the two-pound coin.”

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle.

A public consultation will be held over the summer to consider the metal composition and to weigh up the impact of the new-shaped coin on different stakeholders such as vending machines operators.

Reuters###2297||The Bayou State set a record in January with an unemployment rate the lowest since 2008 and with 25,000 more people employed than the year prior. It was the fifth straight month that unemployment fell in Louisiana.

In January, 1,990,531 people were employed in Louisiana, helping lower the state's unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, according to figures released from state labor officials.

Seasonally adjusted data released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that there were 25,787 more people employed this January than were employed in January 2013; while there were 102,47 people unemployed, translating to 29,310 fewer people not working the year earlier. BLS surveyed 750 households to compile the figures.

The national unemployment rate for January was at 6.6 percent.

In January, Louisiana's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was at its lowest since September 2008 and lowest in the 17-state southern region, where 6.2 percent was the average rate.

The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved in every parish and in all eight metropolitan areas for January 2014. Baton Rouge's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent, from 7.1 percent the year prior. New Orleans' rate decreased to 5.1 percent, down from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

"2014 is picking up right where 2013 left off," said Curt Eysink, executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission in a statement. "Our labor markets are strong and we expect employment will continue to increase as billions of dollars of new projects ramp up during the next three or four years."

The total number of people employed and unemployed, more commonly known as Louisiana's civilian labor force, was 2,093,007 in January, 3,523 fewer than January 2013.

Seasonally adjusted total non-farm employment was 1,956,300 in January. According to the BLS, leisure and hospitality increased the most among all employment sectors with a 10,000-job increase over the year.

Other industries experiencing large increases included transportation, trade and utilities at 5,300; education and health services with a 4,200 jump; and the manufacturing industry with a 2,700 increase.

The largest decline, however, came in the government sector. About 7,200 fewer federal, state and local jobs were counted than in January 2013. Also declining were the information industry, which lost 2,500 jobs; and the mining and logging industry, which decreased by 700 jobs.

###2298||Empty###2299||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###2300||Empty###2301||You are using an older browser version.

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey's attempt to block access to Twitter appeared to backfire today with many tech-savvy users circumventing the ban and suspicions growing that the prime minister was using court orders to suppress corruption allegations against him and his government.

Turkey's telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to the social media network hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "rip out the roots" of the website. Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Turkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country — to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.

President Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.

"I hope this implementation won't last long," he wrote.

Links to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.

Erdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.

"Prime Minister Erdogan's move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media," said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Andrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain's Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System — or DNS — blocking, which was easy to work around.

He said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google's Domain Name System, which isn't affected by the ban.

Earlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.

Twitter's @policy account tweeted: "We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon."

Earlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or "SMS."

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Other EU officials also voiced concerns.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey's minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders — although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy — not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

"Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet," Elvan said. "We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness."

Technology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.

The original source of the leaked recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news reports that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

"Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis," said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch.

In Berlin, the German government's human rights commissioner, Christoph Straesser, called on Turkey to reverse the decision immediately, saying "limiting freedom of the press and opinion on this scale is unacceptable."

Britain's Foreign Office also expressed concern, saying that social media has a "vital role to play" in modern democracy and helps promote transparency and public debate.###2303||You are using an older browser version.

The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are continuing and may still fall apart, these people cautioned. Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $US170 billion — paid more than $US16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged,” said Colin Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out.”

Others view the valuation race more skeptically. “We’re seeing valuations go nuts,” said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.

Under the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations. Those potential hurdles have failed to daunt prospective investors. TPG Growth, for example, participated in a fund-raising round for Uber last year that valued the service at $3.8 billion.



Investors are betting that Airbnb will continue to show enormous growth. Its last fund-raising round, in 2012, valued the company at $US2.5 billion. Should its latest efforts to raise capital succeed, it will carry a higher valuation than Wyndham Worldwide, whose market capitalisation stands at $US9.3 billion, or Hyatt, whose market value is $8.4 billion.

The round would also put a valuation on Airbnb more than twice that of HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation rental company that carried a value of $US3.8 billion as of Thursday. Airbnb’s current investor roll reads like a list of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital firms. Among them: Sequoia Capital, the only outside investor in WhatsApp; Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer of Facebook; Founders Fund; and even the actor Ashton Kutcher. The New York Times###2305||

[dropcap]R[/dropcap]epublicans in the Colorado legislature looking to rail against Obamacare this election season will relish a statistical advantage.

They’ve asked the state’s division of insurance to deliver a letter every month reporting the number of health-insurance policies canceled in the state due to the Affordable Care Act. So, new figures will come at a regular clip from now until Election Day.

But the division is quick to note that the statistics the Republican lawmakers are seeking tell only one side of the politically charged story of Obamacare in Colorado. What’s more, officials say, there’s no easy remedy to the problem of imbalance because the division doesn’t collect the kind of statistics that would paint a more complete picture of how the law is working.

The letter the Division sent Monday to the Senate — the first of many to come — detailed that 1,755 policies serving Colorado consumers in the individual-plan market had been canceled over roughly the last 30 days. Those cancelled policies come in addition to the 335,486 plans canceled between October and the end of February.

The numbers sound bad – perfect fodder for stump speeches and political attack ads aimed at Democrats who support Obamacare. But there’s a difference between how the figures sound and what they represent. Division of Insurance Spokesman Vince Plymell says canceled policies don’t translate directly as lost insurance coverage.

“We only have the statistics on the cancellations,” he said. “We’re not a research institute. We don’t measure how people proceed when they find out a policy has been canceled — if they go to new carriers or onto the exchange. We don’t know. We don’t have statistics on how many people are insured or uninsured or whether that number is rising or falling.

“What we do know is that people have more options now than they did before and that they can’t be denied insurance, which is really a good thing.”

The division has been grappling with the charged politics of policy cancellation numbers for months. When the office first started publishing the growing numbers of cancellations in the state, staffers for Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Udall complained that the figures were unbalanced by the fact that insurance companies were offering alternative plans for renewal. Republicans seized on those complaints to suggest Udall was trying to intimidate division employees for political reasons. The flap led to several rounds of news stories and ended when insurance division officials wrote letters and testified that what lawmakers were calling intimidation was more accurately described as the kind of spirited exchange on the content and quality of its work that the division welcomed.

“A fact finding review revealed no evidence of any intimidation and the ‘level of coercion by Senator Udall and/or his staff’ was zero,” wrote Barbara Kelley, director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies in response to a letter of inquiry from Republican state Rep. Amy Stephens. “There was a disagreement among staff about how to characterize the data. However, the situation was neither received, nor acted upon as coercive or intimidating.”

Insurance plans being canceled in Colorado and around the country don’t meet basic product standards introduced by the Affordable Care Act. Just as car manufacturers can no longer sell vehicles without seat belts or with gas tanks apt to explode in a collision, insurance companies now must sell policies that, for example, cover preexisting conditions, offer low-cost preventative care and contain no caps on coverage that leave in the lurch consumers who run up repeat high charges because they have the great misfortune, for example, of getting in a car wreck and then suffering cancer and later multiple sclerosis.

Indeed, the cancellation numbers are being interpreted as bad and good, depending on your view of the system and your politics. Republican lawmakers see the cancellations as a sign of unnecessary disruption and government overreach. Consumer-rights groups see them as damning evidence that many companies for years have been making a great deal of money selling deeply flawed and overpriced insurance plans.

Plymell said the transition this year to the new market being shaped by the Affordable Care Act is bumpy, but that the law already is expanding consumer choice and increasing coverage.

“The fact is, people prefer to do nothing. It’s human nature. They want to stick with what they got, and the law says insurance companies can’t just map people over to a new plan that the insurance companies think is best. So, people have to do something. But now they can really shop around and they can not be denied if they have preexisting conditions. A lot of people will find better plans than the ones that were canceled,” he said.

Ben Davis, a spokesman for the state’s “Obamacare” insurance exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, said it will be very hard to know with certainty how many people who received cancellation letters signed onto new plans directly with their original providers or other insurance companies.

“Anyway, that’s not what we do,” he said. “We’re not tracking those numbers.”

Like Plymell at the insurance division, Davis says that statistics about large populations – such as all of Colorado’s health-insurance consumers — take years to compile.

Davis said that what Connect for Health can and does carefully track is how many people have signed up for coverage on the state’s healthcare exchange.

From October 1, 2013, and March 17, 2014, more than 250,000 Coloradans enrolled through Connect for Health.

The deadline for signing up is in ten days – on March 31.

Tax fines for not signing up for health coverage this year will be substantial and they will grow every year. A fine calculator is available here. If you make $30,000 per year, you will have to pay a $199 fine for not buying health insurance this year, $412 next year and $695 in 2016. If you make $70,000 per year, you will have to pay a $599 fine this year, $1,236 next year and $1,593 in 2016.###2306||Empty###2307||Latest Stories

This effort is aimed at preventing another collapse of a Bitcoin exchange, like what happened to Japan's Mt Gox, according to VentureBeat.

A note about the software update read: "If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version."

The updated Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 now has five modifications that will protect the cryptocurrency from future attacks. The previous version had a flaw that overlooked mutated Bitcoin transactions. Because of that, the records on the Bitcoin blockchain did not match that of Mt Gox's, Gizmodo explained.

The modified software now prevents relaying or mining of those mutated transactions. In addition, the software now promptly reports any irregularities in wallet transactions, the report noted.###2309||British luxury company Mulberry Group has revealed that Bruno Guillon is to step down as CEO with immediate effect.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Guillon, who has been in the role for just two years, joined the business from French luxury brand Hermès where he was managing director of its French division.

While he has been credited with helping Mulberry to increase its international appeal and grow international retail sales, his departure comes after the company earlier this year issued a profit warning on tough UK trading at Christmas and order cancellations in South Korea.

The group's total retail sales were down 3% in the 17 weeks to 25 January, and down 7% for the last eight weeks of that period.

The company was also rocked by departure of its creative director Emma Hill last year amid reports of disagreements over company strategy. Hill was largely responsible for leading the resurgence of Mulberry in recent years.###2310||* Angry reaction at home and abroad as Twitter blocked

* On campaign trail, Erdogan vows to “wipe out” Twitter

* President criticises complete closure of platform

* Regulator says ban follows court order

* Twitter says stands with users in Turkey (Recasts, adds Twitter comment)

By Nick Tattersall and Orhan Coskun

ANKARA, March 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections brought a furious reaction at home and abroad on Friday, with users of the social networking service denouncing the move as a “digital coup” and the president expressing his disapproval.

A court blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.

“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon,” the company said in a tweet.

A company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.

Tech-savvy Turks - President Abdullah Gul apparently among them - quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.

“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.

Turkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.

Twitter users called the move a “digital coup”, some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.

“Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations,” U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.

Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticise the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.

The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.

EUROPEAN VALUES?

Telecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.

“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and “cast doubt on Turkey’s stated commitment to European values and standards”. Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.

Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a “vital role to play in a modern democracy”.

Turkey’s financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.

Twitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. “We will wipe out all of these,” he said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is.”

Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure “does not derive from a prohibitive mentality” and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling.

NEW YORK (AP) ��Sally�Beauty says that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

The seller of beauty supplies is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm. It is also working with the U.S. Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Sally�Beauty Holdings Inc., which is based in Denton, Texas, said Monday that it will provide more information on its website in coming days, including notification of affected consumers and others.

A spate of major data breaches in recent months has raised awareness about the vulnerability of cards used in the U.S.

Recent intrusions include those at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus. The Target breach compromised 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of up to 70 million customers. At Neiman Marcus, its breach may have compromised 1.1 million debit and credit cards.

Security experts have been long pushed for increased consumer protection through so-called EMV enabled credit and debit cards, which are already common in Europe. Most cards in the U.S. still feature magnetic strips.

Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard, which seek broader acceptance of EMV technology from retailers and ATMs, said that they are creating a group intended to help the retail and banking industries come together on more-secure credit card payments. Visa and MasterCard, which run the networks that carry the payments, said the group's initial focus will be on chips embedded in newer credit cards that make them more secure.



###2315||Ahead of today's budget, Chancellor George Osborne dipped into his pocket and displayed a new 12-sided £1 coin, the coin's first redesign in 30 years. The reasoning behind this costly move? It's less-easy prey for counterfeiters, supposedly.

While introducing a new coin will cost the country an undisclosed amount to create, Osborne has said that the new design will cut down on fraud, said to cost us millions each year, thanks to its Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) tech. The Royal Mint actually thinks that around 45 million £1 coins, in our pockets and down the backs of sofas, are actually forgeries.

[Reuters]###2316||Empty###2317||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

LONDON, United Kingdom — Mulberry Group Plc said Bruno Guillon will step down as chief executive officer after two years during which the British luxury handbag maker lost two-thirds of its market value.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Hermes International SCA in March 2012, will leave immediately, Somerset, England-based Mulberry said today in a statement. Former CEO Godfrey Davis, the company’s non-executive chairman, will become executive chairman until a successor is found, Mulberry said.

Guillon’s plan to raise prices and expand Mulberry globally failed to resonate with consumers. In January, Mulberry said profit would be substantially below estimates because of weak sales in the U.K. and order cancellations in South Korea.

Mulberry creative director Emma Hill, who was credited with driving the company’s growth with bags such as the Alexa, quit last year after disagreeing with Guillon on strategy, a person familiar with the situation said at the time.

The shares fell 2.1 percent to 636.5 pence yesterday in London. They have slumped 67 percent since Guillon joined.

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration published in the Federal Register new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would have to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

“Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can’t finish, we won’t shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don’t have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can’t get coverage again until next year,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare’s six-month enrollment period. Most of those bugs have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website’s capacities in the final days of the enrollment period. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Caren Bohan and Andrew Hay)###2322||Why did this happen?

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2325||We are sorry, you need to be a subscriber to watch this video

Ooooh! Let’s throw a Brosurance keg party!!!

The March Obamacare numbers are surging! Yes, in just the first two weeks of March, the number of “enrollees” has surged 800,000 from 4.2 million to 5 million. How do I know this? Because the Department of Health and Human Services told me so and the most “transparent” administration in history would never fib, would they? If you think that your humble correspondent is incredibly naive for blindly swallowing the HHS Obamacare numbers, I am just reflecting the attitude of a report at NBC News written by senior health writer Maggie Fox acting as if she were a stenographer for the HHS PR department:

“Five million people have now signed up for health insurance on the state and federal online exchanges, the Obama administration said Monday — a number that suggests a big-last minute surge to get coverage.

“The new figures suggest a final push by the White House to get people to enroll is working. The deadline to get signed up for 2014 is March 31, just two weeks away. As of March 1, the Health and Human Services Department said 4.2 million people had signed up.”

I am so excited that I can hardly contain myself! But after that moment of excitement, nagging questions start to gnaw at me. Like questions about how many of those supposed enrollees have actually paid for their Obamacare? Ms Fox conveniently refrains from exploring that piece of data but many of her readers in the comments section express the healthy skepticism that Fox completely avoids:

“HHS actually tells you it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to know how many people have actually paid, this despite word from the Insurance Industry that they have been reporting these numbers to HHS all along.

“Less than 2% of Americans get Obama Care. But how many people had their insurance cancel them because of the changes?

“Now 1 million people have signed up in the last 2 weeks???????????? Since we are getting these #’s, how about the number of people who have active , paid for coverage now?????”

We landed a man on the moon 35 years ago. We invented wireless communication. We basically are living much like the cartoon Jetsons. Yet we can’t count how many people have paid for the policy? This defies common sense.

Gamers can exchange their video games for the worth any product in a Wal-Mart or Sam's Club location on site or on the internet beginning Wed. March 26

Wal-Mart will then prepare for store shelves at a discounted price than the amount it was originally bought for a press release on the company's website reported.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer at Wal-Mart in the United States said in a statement. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," Mac Naughton said in a statement.

According to the press release, games must be in the materials they came in, and brought to the electronics department in any Wal-Mart store,

Store employees will enter the game into their system, and check the product to see what wear and tear it has including deep scratches, or cracks the press release reported.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart said in a statement on the company's blog.

Wal-Mart will then give customers the amount the game is worth so they can use the funds on another product at Wal-Mart's over 3,100 locations throughout the United States.

The process applies for every game someone turns into the program, dubbed the video game trade-in program the press release reported.

Unit sales jumped 6.4 percent to a record 1.964 million vehicles, with all three company brands - BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce - registering all-time highs, the Munich-based company said.

Noting that BMW had achieved a new sales record for the fourth consecutive year, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer told a news conference that the weakness of European markets had been compensated with higher growth in the United States and China, accounting for a share of 20 and 19 percent respectively in 2013.

Stressing BMW's principle that production must follow the market, Reithofer said that the company was currently evaluating the possibility of expanding capacity at its Spartanburg plant in the US. Moreover, production in China was planned to be revved up to 400,000 cars in the medium term, while a joint venture with Chinese carmaker Brilliance was beginning engine production in 2016. In Brazil, a new factory would go online this fall, tapping into the Latin American growth markets, Reithofer added.

Therefore, BMW was looking forward with confidence to the current fiscal year, in which the group's unit sales were expected to surpass the 2-million mark for the first time in company history.

"We also expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions," Reithofer added.

As a result of its 2013 earnings, BMW announced a higher dividend of 2.60 euros on common shares and 2.62 euros on preference shares.

Colorado’s Amendment 64 bars legislators from lobbying state officials for two years after they leave office. But there’s nothing that stops former department directors from going to work for the industry they regulated.

Matt Cook and Laura Harris’ jobs were to enforce the rules and regulations of Colorado’s marijuana industry. Now both of them are working for it.

The news about Harris comes in a release from Denver Relief Consulting that states “former cannabis enforcement chief joins firm.”

The release does not state exactly what Harris, the former head of marijuana enforcement, will do but cites her background in regulatory compliance.

Elena Nunez is State Executive Director of Common Cause, a non-partisan organization that works for credible government.

“There are a couple of problems potentially. One, they have specialized knowledge of the agency and its processes and they also have special relationships that can influence their ability to get approval for contracts contributions or other things,” said Nunez.

Matt Cook was spotlighted on the CBS news program “60 Minutes.”

“Matt Cook, a former narcotics officer, wrote the law and served as the state’s first director of enforcement,” they said.

Cook is now a consultant to the marijuana industry with the 60 Minutes interview displayed on his website. His credentials include Senior Director of Enforcement for the Colorado Department of Revenue.

“We need to make sure those folks who are privy to confidential information about the industry or client matters. Maintain that confidentiality and privilege,” said State Rep. and Assistant House Majority Leader Dan Pabon.

Harris and Cook could not be reached for comment. The governor’s office said it found no legal or ethical breach on their part.###2337||DENVER — Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper — who opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in his state — said Monday he hasn't seen the economic fallout he feared.

Hickenlooper, whose priority has been luring businesses and entrepreneurs to Denver, Boulder, and other hubs, had worried a view of Colorado's as the stoner state could "distort all the work that we've done" in presenting a pro-business image, he said in an interview.

"We haven't seen it yet," he said of the feared negative economic impact. "That's why we have been so aggressive and rigorous with implementing the regulations."

The referendum legalized the use of marijuana, as well as possession of up to an ounce, for all Colorado residents over 21. Titled "Amendment 64," it went into effect on Dec. 10, 2012, after passing by a 9% margin of the popular vote the previous month, though legal sales of marijuana didn't begin until January of this year.

Hickenlooper, to the fury of the referendum's supporters, opposed it, but has worked with the nascent legal industry to impose a strict regulatory and tax regime — and he said the industry has been as cooperative as he always thought it would be.

"We predicted that this would be an industry that would function like any other industry — that they would be no more or less driven or acquisitive than any other industry and they would be no more or less given to regulation and supporting regulation," Hickenlooper said between bites of breakfast burrito at a long desk in his Capitol office. "They look at their self-interest just like another business, but it's a whole different framework: No one has ever had a self-interest like this, where they have got to protect the right to do in a state what's illegal nationally."

"The industry was a great supporter of our very stiff tax rates; generally they've been supportive of our pretty stiff regulation," he said.

Colorado residents can purchase up to an ounce of marijuana only from specialty licensed retail shops. Currently, only already-existing medical marijuana dispensaries are eligible for a recreational license, though this restriction will lift in October of this year. Retailers must properly label all products with clear information regarding warnings, serving size, and potency, and any marijuana magazines must be treated like pornography by being placed behind the counter. Additionally, those who choose to grow their own plants at home are limited to six plants, with only three flowering at any given time.

Hickenlooper said his main remaining worry is polling suggesting that legalization has persuaded young people that marijuana is perfectly safe, when many neurologists believe it can impair a developing brain.

He also said the benefits of tax revenues from the legal product can be overstated.

"The other governors tease me, they say, 'I wouldn't be so rigorous if I had $130 million in tax revenue projected,'" he said. "But that's a drop in the bucket compared to how the world thinks of your state as a place to build a business."

Hickenlooper, indeed, is running for reelection on a platform of economic growth and pro-business management. His state weathered the economic crisis better than most, and his regular emails to supporters bely much concern that marijuana has derailed its growth.

"While the rest of the country's economy is slowly picking back up, we're thriving here in Colorado," he wrote earlier this month.

Weed also appears unlikely to be a central election issue. Hickenlooper opponent Bob Beauprez recently told ABC News that he'd look for "a way to agree with" Hickenlooper on marijuana regulation.

Hickenlooper said he was "surprised" that Beauprez, a former congressman, had chosen to enter the race. "I would have thought he would have supported a lot of our economic development stuff," he said.

Colorado, though, is the fulcrum of nearly every other divisive issue in the country: Hickenlooper is under assault from the right for his support of gun control, and from the left for backing the natural gas extraction technique known as fracking. Republicans, in particular, see an opportunity in tying Hickenlooper to the Affordable Care Act, which he supports, although Colorado's state-run health insurance exchange has not been as troubled as HealthCare.gov.

"I am concerned that it is going to be a difficult year for Democrats and I am going to be painted with that same brush," he said. And while he pointed to a rare decrease in the rate of growth in health care costs as a sign that the Affordable Care Act's cost-control measures are working, he says he doesn't expect that to help much with the politics. He also said he doesn't anticipate wanting President Obama (or any other out-of-state figure) to campaign for him.

"As a campaign thing, when I walk into a room and say how many people hate the ACA, half of the hands or two-thirds of the hands in the room go up," he said.

Hickenlooper also quietly came out for marriage equality toward the bottom of a press release March 3, a decision he described Monday as a "nuance" and natural evolution from his longtime support for equal civil marriage rights, while leaving churches free to make their own decisions.

"The debate had changed sufficiently that I think people can understand that supporting civil marriage is a way of saying I support every single right for every single person," he said.###2338||NEW YORK — Walmart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Walmart plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Walmart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Walmart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In a wrinkle on GameStop’s program, Walmart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Walmart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits from the resale.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Walmart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Walmart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However … buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

Share###2339||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- You only get so long to perform a turnaround. Steve Bennett -- who was replaced as the CEO of the computer security software company Symantec (SYMC) on Thursday -- probably thinks that 20 months was not long enough. But the company's board were not convinced. As they wrote in a statement that was released after the market close Thursday:

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

When Bennett joined Symantec, its shares were below $15. During his tenure as CEO, the stock rallied as high as $27, as investors initially agreed with his efforts to streamline and reorganize Symantec's product range -- including Norton anti-virus software -- as well as to cut costs. The last two quarterly corporate disclosures, though, have disappointed the market. This appears, at first glance, to have had some influence.

So what should investors think?

The shares are down today to levels last seen over a year ago. As of 11:30 a.m., they're trading at $18.02, down 13.8% for the day. Year to date, the stock is down 23.4%.

Yet the cyber security sector appears to be as attractive as ever. Businesses and consumers, on both their networks and electronic devices, only have a greater need for security over time. That's why companies like Check Point Software (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have had such strong stock prices recently.

Clearly, though, something is not right with Symantec. Accompanying the disappointing recent quarterly results have been a series of resignations (and appointments) to the management team.

My instinct is that Steve Bennett's desire -- as expressed in the last quarterly results conference call in January -- to "continue to drive improved efficiency and better resource allocation across the company" has upset too many of the company's employees. The approach likely lost the support of the other board members. Combine this with a poor last couple of quarters, and this led to yesterday's end to his CEO tenure.

But Symantec still has a lot going for it. Despite all its recent troubles, Symantec still has strong brands like Norton. It continues to generate free cash. Plus, at the current share price, it has a dividend yield of nearly 3%. It has more than $700 million of outstanding share buyback capability and has net cash on the balance sheet of well over $1 billion. That's significant for a company with a market capitalization of under $13 billion. That will have caught the eye of other companies, including those in private equity.

Longer-term technology sector watchers may remember that Intel (INTC) purchased Symantec's peer McAfee a few years ago.

Given the importance of cyber security to both businesses and individuals, Symantec's troubles and weak share price present a prime time for investors to do their due diligence. It's time to act. Embrace the volatility and consider Symantec shares now, when they're on sale.

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###2346||Empty###2347||Turkey's ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections sparked public fury over a "digital coup" on Friday, brought international condemnation and triggered a rift between prime minister and president.

Twitter must get a legal representative in Turkey and agree to block individual accounts if it is to resolve a row that has led the government to block access to the service, Industry Minister Fikri Isik said on Friday.

Courts blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local polls, to "wipe out" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

Tech-savvy Turks, President Abdullah Gul apparently among them, quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey rapidly moving to among the top trending globally.

"One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the pugnacious prime minister.

Corruption scandal

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.

Turkey's main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country's bar association filed a separate court challenge.

Twitter users called it a "digital coup", some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.

There were also calls for protests.

"Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations," United States author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, wrote on his Twitter feed.

The ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Conciliatory figure

Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticise the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the brewing scandal and the latter's increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.

The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the courts had blocked Twitter after citizens complained that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.

"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens," it said.

European Union enlargement commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and "cast doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards". Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.

German disapproval

The government of Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British foreign office said social media had a "vital role to play in a modern democracy".

Turkey's financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the US dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24% from 11.12%.

San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday.

"Twitter, mwitter!," he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!".

"We will wipe out all of these," Erdogan said. "The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is," he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.

Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary. Finance Minister Mehmet also played down concerns, telling state broadcaster TRT Haber that the closure "does not derive from a prohibitive mentality" and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling. – Reuters###2348||ATLANTA (AP) — Federal and state officials have been working for nearly two years to shore up the nation's election infrastructure from cyberattacks by...###2349||Empty###2350||Empty###2351||Harriet Green

Maryland’s health exchange this week announced a plan to let consumers who begin the process but fail to sign up by the end of March have extra time to complete their enrollment. Nevada’s exchange said Thursday it will consider a similar 60-day grace period.

And in Washington state, exchange spokeswoman Bethany Frey said customers prevented from enrolling by March 31 because of a system error will have their applications reviewed “on a case-by-case basis.”

The state efforts have not been blessed by the Obama administration, which flatly rejected the additional time.

“The deadline is March 31,” a Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman said.

But Matthew Lawrence, a fellow at Harvard Law School, said it’s no surprise the administration is talking tough now — though it ultimately might find a plausible legal basis to help people bypass the March 31 deadline.

“I expect the administration to wait before announcing any retroactive ‘fix’ for those who tried and failed for fear that an announcement before the deadline could give people a license to procrastinate,” he said.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is confident it’ll have enough sign-ups by the end of the month, including enough young, healthy people, to make the economics of Obamacare work.

Healthier adults are needed to create a balanced risk pool and keep premiums in check when insurers take stock of the first round of enrollment and set prices for the coming year.

“We’re confident that come April 1, you will see a demographic mix that is equal to the objective, which is to ensure that actuarially the marketplaces function effectively,” Mr. Carney said.

Once final enrollment numbers are known, the next question will be what insurers do with premiums headed into 2015.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently told Congress she thinks premiums will rise in the coming year, but at a slower rate than usual because of the law.

Some industry professionals disagreed with Mrs. Sebelius assessment in news reports, saying premiums could spike multifold in some areas because of the troubled rollout.

Dan Mendelson, CEO of the Avalere health care consultancy in Washington, said a spike in premiums on the Obamacare marketplace is feasible, although likely a “not massive” one, and that the exchanges should remain competitive.

He said the March 31 deadline is in place in part to give companies a chance to take stock of where things are.

“You have to allow plans to reset, think about premiums and have a structured process,” he said.

Any tangible spike this year would damage Democratic candidates who supported the law and are up for re-election in November, as Republicans have made it clear they will wield Obamacare’s troubles as a truncheon during the mid-term contests.

The law’s stumbles are even causing intraparty problems in Maryland, where Democratic candidates to succeed Gov. Martin O’Malley are sparring over the state’s glitchy exchange website and the governor is trying to stem any bleeding over the coming days.

On Tuesday, it announced a stopgap measure to help — through telephone guidance — anyone who tried to sign up by March 31, but couldn’t complete their application by that date.

Kentucky’s exchange will allow people to apply for coverage by March 31 and pick a plan by April 15, exchange spokeswoman Gwenda Bond said.

The used game trade-ins commence next week in select Walmart stores across the US.

This will start from Wednesday the 26th March at 3,100 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores across the States and later down the road we can expect to see pre-owned games on the shelves, although titles traded-in next week for credit will not be accessible for re-sell immediately.

For those looking for additional help when it comes to trading unwanted games the official Walmart website has posted a video tutorial, although games are already available. In an article on Games Industry they discuss Walmart’s introduction to the game trade-in business as the company look to prise some of the action away from leading competitors.

We can probably expect to see the used and traded games available to in-store consumers as early as this summer, as Walmart intends to let the gamer pay less for their titles. This comes from executive vice president Duncan Mac Naughton as he comments about their expectations that will see Walmart pay more for games, while customers pay less.

The company expect to take on all games for all existing console systems and Mac Naughton says “trade-in prices will, of course, vary depending on a title’s popularity,” even though he does expect the average price paid per game to be around $35.

Therefore, we can see this becoming even more advantageous for gamers looking to exchange, trade or buy used games.###2361||Empty###2362||March 19, 2014 /3BL Media/ - ING U.S., Inc.

Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh session lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, following reports that armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol.

EUR/USD hit session lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.24% to 1.3888.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3850 and resistance at 1.3941, the session high.

The euro extended losses after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The euro slipped against the dollar earlier Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

The euro fell to session lows against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.56% to 140.85.

Elsewhere, the dollar was trading close to session lows against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.32% to 101.42, holding above last Friday's trough of 101.19.###2365||Empty###2366||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Symantec (SYMC) has shocked Wall Street, announcing the surprise exit of president and CEO Steve Bennett, marking its third CEO change in just over five years.

Shares are spiraling on the news. By midafternoon, the stock is down 12.3% to $18.33.

Trading volume of 43.7 million is more than six times its three-month daily average.

Bennett held the position since 2012 and led the charge in a turnaround plan which involved targets of more than 5% organic growth and over 30% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

The firm said Bennett's termination was a result of an ongoing deliberative process rather than any event or impropriety.

Until a permanent replacement has been found, board member Michael Brown will act as interim president and CEO.

Over the last few quarters, the company has struggled with declining PC sales dampening the take-up rate of its Norton antivirus software. Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec reiterated its fourth-quarter guidance of revenue between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion and adjusted earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters anticipate quarterly revenue of $1.644 billion and earnings of 42 cents a share.

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

TheStreet Ratings team rates SYMANTEC CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.

SYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).

The gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.

SYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.8%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.

FHFA MBS Settlements Surpass $10 Billion Non-agency MBS sold to Fannie and Freddie at issue March 21, 2014 By Mortgage Daily staff





The latest settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency brings to more than $10 billion the amount the regulator has collected from parties that allegedly sold faulty securities to the government-sponsored housing enterprises.



FHFA filed 18 lawsuits in 2011 against issuers and underwriters of private-label MBS that were sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007.



The lawsuits alleged that the defendants violated the Securities Act of 1933 by deceiving the secondary lenders about the quality of the MBS and the underwriting performed on the loans.

[Image via Agence France-Presse]###2370||The fresh wave of US sanctions against Russia include banning some of the country's richest and most influential businessmen - and President Vladimir Putin's closest friends - from entering America.

Among the individuals targeted with and travel bans and freezing of US assets are billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

The co-owners of SMP Bank and SGM Group, a major supplier of construction services to Russian gas giant Gazprom, were judo sparring partners with Mr Putin.

The pair - friends of Mr Putin since childhood - also made billions in Sochi Olympics-related contracts.

Financier Yuri Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya, is a personal banker for senior Russian officials - including, reportedly, Mr Putin. He is another close friend - and a neighbour - of the president.

They have known each other since the early 1990s when Mr Kovalchuk was deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

The bank - also on the hit list - serves some of the country's wealthiest officials and controls two big insurance firms - Sogas and SK Transneft.

High-level Kremlin officials including Mr Putin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov and deputy chief of staff Alexei Gromov are also targeted, as well as Vladimir Yakunin, chairman of the board of the Russian state-owned company Russian Railways and a close confidant of the president.

Gennady Timchenko, a prominent businessman and owner of the private investment group, Volga Group, which specialises in investments in energy, transport and infrastructure assets is also named by the US.

President Putin's spokesman said some of the names on the list caused "nothing but extreme bewilderment" - and Russia immediately responded with its own list of sanctions on American officials.

These included Obama aides Caroline Atkinson (deputy assistant and deputy national security adviser for international economics), Daniel Pfeiffer (senior adviser and assistant ), and Benjamin Rhodes (assistant and deputy national security adviser for strategic communications and speechwriting), as well as senators Mary Landrieu, John McCain and Daniel Coats.

Mr McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate, and Mr Putin have long been engaged in a bitter personal feud.

During their last war of words in September 2013, the US senator accused Mr Putin of corruption, repression and self-serving rule in an opinion piece for a Russian website in response to a letter Mr Putin wrote in The New York Times, urging America not to use military force in Syria.

In an opinion piece headlined "Russians Deserve Better Than Putin", Mr McCain also accused the president of being "a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed" for siding with Syria's President Bashar al Assad.

Back in December 2011, Mr Putin let his views be known on Mr McCain after the US politician tweeted "Dear Vlad, The #ArabSpring is coming to a neighbourhood near you" at a time of huge protests across Moscow.

When pressed about the tweet during a televised phone-in, the Russian president hit back, calling the senator "nuts".

"Mr McCain fought in Vietnam. I think he has enough blood of peaceful citizens on his hands. It must be impossible for him to live without these disgusting scenes anymore," he said.

Mr Putin added: "Mr McCain was captured and they kept him not just in prison, but in a pit for several years. Anyone [in his place] would go nuts."

Earlier this month, Speaker of the House John Boehner, also on the Russian list, called Mr Putin a "thug" over its actions in Crimea, according to The Enquirer.

The Republican told the Cincinnati newspaper it was "time to stand up to Putin", adding: "At what point do you say enough is enough? We are at that point."

He, and Senators Landrieu, McCain and Coats hailed their inclusion on the Russian list as a "badge of honour", while the White House refused to comment.###2371||New, economically viable deposits of lithium, nickel, cobalt and other metals required for lithium-ion batteries have never been so greatly in demand, notes Kris Kottmeier of The Venture Letter.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

In a brief statement, the maker of Bayswater and Alexa handbags said Frenchman Guillon had decided to step down immediately. He had been CEO for just over two years, having joined from Birkin handbag maker Hermes <hrms.pa>.

The statement gave no reason for his departure and did not say if he would receive any payoff. "The board agreed that it was now time to part company," a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Godfrey Davis, 64, currently non-executive chairman after holding such roles as finance chief and CEO in his 27 years with the group, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon "has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

"I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he said.

Mulberry shares rose 1.3 percent to 644.5 pence at 0841 GMT.

Under Guillon, Mulberry had hiked prices to take its brand more upmarket from a traditional position of "affordable luxury" and embarked on a drive to increase the company's profile overseas, targeting affluent Asian shoppers with new stores in key tourist spots.

But the group was forced to downgrade its profit forecasts at the end of January for the third time in around 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas hit sales in its British market, which makes up around 65 percent of group revenue.

GROWTH STRATEGY

The warning wiped over 25 percent off its shares at the time, a loss from which they are yet to recover as investors and analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry's growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to suffer from its more upmarket and exclusive aspirations, with evidence growing that even larger rivals like Kering <prtp.pa>and LVMH <lvmh.pa>, Gucci and Louis Vuitton's respective parents, are losing out to newer, more affordable brands.

Since his arrival, Guillon, who has also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry's share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged the stock down to be worth less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned for the final time.

On that occasion the 48 year old, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, had told Reuters his strategy would not change.

Adding to his woes, the group also lost Emma Hill, the creative director behind its hit Alexa and Del Rey bags, last September, and have yet to appoint a replacement. ($1 = 0.6014 British Pounds)

WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and other banks will find out if the Federal Reserve thinks they can cope with the next financial crisis when it publishes the results of an annual health check on Thursday.

If the Fed finds that any of the 30 banks subject to the so-called stress tests are still at risk, the banks will then have a few days to change any plans they may have made to return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buy-backs.

Most banks are expected to pass the exam, but analysts will closely watch the results. Last year, American Express lowered its capital distribution proposal after the first submission.

And banks may have been more willing to take risks with their initial plans this year, now that they have been building up capital in the years since the crisis.

“These banks are very well capitalized and I know they’re going to want to get more aggressive each incremental year in terms of what they ask for,” said Fred Cannon, global director of research for Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.

The annual testing has become an increasingly important tool for regulators to ensure that banks are not eating too much into their capital cushions, by examining how banks would weather a hypothetical major market shock.

Analysts said the biggest U.S. banks will probably meet the Fed’s requirements, having reduced their leverage, the amount of debt compared to shareholder equity, since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Bigger fireworks could come next week, when the Fed will either approve or reject each firm’s plans to pay dividends to shareholders or buy back shares.

The Fed conducts stress tests each year to measure how banks’ loan books and security portfolios would hold up under extreme economic scenarios not unlike those experienced during the last crisis.

Thirty banks participated in this set of tests, up from 18 last year.

The first chunk of results is meant to show banks’ relative strength if each firm made the same capital moves. The Fed assumed each bank would pay dividends equal to the average of the past four quarters, and buy back no shares.

Last year, only Ally Financial failed to meet the minimum 5 percent capital buffer in the first round of the tests.

In a new hurdle imposed this year, the biggest eight banks had to consider what would happen to their business if their largest trading counterparty were to default.

The Fed will make its own projections for bank balance sheets this year, and banks may release results of their internal stress tests if they disagree.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10 billion would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39 billion.###2379||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

GameStop, the biggest seller of used video games, opened its doors Tuesday to find the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, was taking aim at one of its main lines of business.

Walmart said Tuesday it will step up its game and start offering store credit to customers who trade in used video games.

Scared by the upcoming battle, investors sent shares of Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop down 3.4 percent, to $38.39, Tuesday.

The used video-game business is a lucrative one, and GameStop likely has no intention of backing down.

“Our buy-sell-trade program creates a unique value proposition to our customers by providing our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products and mobile devices for store credits and apply those credits toward other merchandise, which in turn, increases sales,” the company said in its most recent 10K regulatory filing.

There are roughly 2.3 billion used games in circulation, GameStop estimates, so there is not likely to be a shortage any time soon.

It’s clear why customers like buying second-hand video games. The average price of a used video game is $19 at GameStop, compared with $41 for a new one, according to the company.

As of December 2012, the company had 3,100 different used video-game titles in its inventory throughout its 6,600 stores.

Roughly 27 percent, or $2.4 billion, of its total revenue of $8.9 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2013, came from used video games, the company said.###2382||Empty###2383||Empty###2384||Text size

* Australian PM says search planes investigating potential debris

* Objects about 2,500 km southwest of Perth

* Norwegian merchant vessel arrives in the search area (Adds search called off for the night)

By Jane Wardell and Siva Govindasamy

SYDNEY/KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Reuters) - Aircraft and ships ploughed through dire weather on Thursday in search of objects floating in remote seas off Australia that Malaysia’s government called a “credible lead” in the trans-continental hunt for a jetliner missing for nearly two weeks.

The large objects, which Australian officials said were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe, are the most promising find in days as searchers scour a vast area for the plane lost with 239 people on board.

A Norwegian merchant ship arrived in the area on Thursday, but officials cautioned it could take days to confirm if the objects were parts of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777. Malaysia’s government said the search would continue elsewhere despite the sighting in the southern Indian Ocean.

The area where the objects were spotted is around 2,500 km (1,500 miles) southwest of Perth, roughly corresponding to the far end of a southern track that investigators calculated the aircraft could have taken after it was diverted.

“Yesterday I said that we wanted to reduce the area of the search. We now have a credible lead,” Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

A search for the plane that began in the tropical waters off Malaysia’s east coast has now switched to the vast, icy southern oceans between Australia, southern Africa and Antarctica.

Two Royal Australia Air Force AP-3C Orions, a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon and a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion were involved in Thursday’s search which was called off late in the evening and will resume on Friday.

There have been many false leads and no confirmed wreckage found from Flight MH370 since it vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

Hishammuddin said the information on the objects received from Australia had been “corroborated to a certain extent” by other satellites, making it more credible than previous leads.

The larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres (79 ft), long and appeared to be floating in water several thousand metres deep, Australian officials said. The second object was about five metres (16 feet) long. Arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water.

“It’s credible enough to divert the research to this area on the basis it provides a promising lead to what might be wreckage from the debris field,” Royal Australian Air Force Air Commodore John McGarry told a news conference in Canberra.

The satellite images, provided by U.S. company DigitalGlobe , were taken on March 16, meaning that the possible debris could by now have drifted far from the original site.

Australian officials said an aircraft had dropped a series of marker buoys in the area, which will provide information about currents to assist in calculating the latest location.

The captain of the first Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane to return from the search area described the weather conditions as “extremely bad” with rough seas and high winds.

A Norwegian car carrier diverted from its journey from Madagascar to Melbourne and had arrived in the search area, the ship’s owner said. A Royal Australian Navy ship equipped to recover any objects was also en route.

China’s icebreaker for Antarctic research, Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, will set off from Perth to search the area, Chinese state news agency Xinhua cited maritime authorities as saying. About two-thirds of the 227 passengers on Flight MH370 were Chinese nationals.

BACKGROUND CHECKS

Investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane’s communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course.

Exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have yielded barely anything that might explain why.

The discovery of the floating objects was revealed by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

“The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,” he told parliament.

The dimensions of the objects given are consistent with at least one of them possibly being the major part of a 777-200ER wing, which is around 27 metres (89 feet) long, though Australian officials cautioned the first images were indistinct.

The relatively large size of the objects would suggest that, if they do come from the missing aircraft, it was largely intact when it went into the water.

If the plane had run out of fuel, it would not necessarily have plummeted but its behaviour would have depended on whether there was someone in control and their intentions, pilots said.

Modern aircraft are designed to use the rush of wind to drive a small emergency turbine that keeps hydraulics and some electrical power running if the engines run out of fuel.

If the debris is from the plane, investigators would face a daunting task to retrieve the “black box” data and voice recorders needed to help understand what caused the disaster.

University of Western Australia Professor of Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi said that, based on currents in the area, if the debris is from the plane it probably would have entered the water around 300-400 km (180-250 miles) to the west.

The search area covered an ocean ridge known as Naturalist Plateau, a large sea shelf about 3,500 metres (9,800 feet) deep, Pattiaratchi said. The plateau is about 250 km (150 miles) wide by 400 km (250 miles) long, and the area around it is close to 5,000 metres (16,400 feet) deep.

“Whichever way you go, it’s deep,” Pattiaratchi said.

Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that, minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the Gulf of Thailand, the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established route towards India.

What happened next is unclear, but faint electronic “pings” picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. That would be consistent with the plane ending up in the southern Indian Ocean.

The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, has focused particular attention on the pilot and co-pilot.

The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane, after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month.

A Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigations into the pilots said three simulator games that 53-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had played were being looked at.

“We are following up on the data logs being erased,” the source said. “These could be logs of the games that were erased to free up memory, so it may not lead us to anything. He played a lot of games, going into hundreds and thousands of hours.” (Additional reporting by Tim Hepher, A.

Walmart, the world’s largest megaretailer, is getting into the used-games business in the U.S. The company revealed today that it will start accepting trade-ins March 26. The company will give customers gift cards in exchange for old games, and those cards are good for any item at Walmart or Sam’s Club. This strategy could help one of the largest retail operations pick up a bigger chunk of the $13 billion that U.S. consumers spend on games at retail. This may also force GameStop, the huge gaming-specific retailer in the U.S., to offer better used-game prices to keep up with the competition.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,” Walmart chief marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said in a statement. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

We’ve reached out to GameStop for a comment on this. We’ll update this story with any new information. In addition to Walmart and GameStop, companies like Amazon and Best Buy all accept used games in exchange for store credit.

While the trade-in program starts next week, Walmart won’t begin selling used games until later this year — likely after it builds up an inventory. When a trade-in begins, the stores will examine each game disc to make sure it is operational. The company will then refurbish the discs to sell in a “like new” condition.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy preowned games,” Mac Naughton said.

Walmart isn’t new to offering gift cards for old items. The retailer currently accepts tablets and smartphones in exchange for credit at its stores. It also sells those refurbished items on its website. We’ve reached out to the company to ask if this means it will also accept used gaming hardware. We’ll update this post once we have that information.

Related articles###2389||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — It’s no secret that Carl Icahn has had a vision of which way eBay Inc. should go with its PayPal electronics-payment business.

And on Wednesday, that vision got a little clearer. If your idea of perfect vision is 80/20, anyway.

That’s the view Icahn believes eBay EBAY, -0.77% should have with regards to PayPal. Specifically, he called for eBay to sell off 20% of PayPal in a public-stock offering and maintain an 80% ownership stake in the business. Icahn made his views known in what may be his longest screed since he began battling with eBay over PayPal, and certain members of the eBay board of directors several weeks ago.

“We believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal – and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses – will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,” Icahn wrote in his latest open letter to eBay shareholders. “The 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the “secret sauce” and “flywheels” would be preserved.

Icahn, who owns about 2% of eBay’s stock, gave what might as well be called his “seven points” for why he thinks it makes sense for eBay to spin off 20% of PayPal into a separate, publicly traded company. In a nutshell, Icahn said such a move:

1) Highlights value. “A separation of the businesses will allow investors and analysts to more clearly see the value” of what Icahn called PayPal’s sustainable double-digit growth and eBay’s strong free cash flow.

2) Focuses management teams. This has been a big one for Icahn, who has repeatedly said the “inexcusable incompetence” of eBay’s management has cost its shareholders billions of dollars.

3) Creates a valuable currency for acquisitions and attracting top talent. Icahn noted eBay’s recent $800 million purchase of Braintree in order to incorporate its payments processes with PayPal, but said PayPal’s stock would be “a more valuable currency” on its own for incorporating advantages in the payments business. Icahn went on to say that “PayPal employees will be more motivated when the company operates independently of eBay.”

4) Prevent dissynergies. Icahn hinted that PayPal, by being so tied to eBay, is unable to pursue potential strategic partnerships with the likes of Google Inc. GOOG, -1.67% and Facebook Inc. FB, -1.11%

5) Preserves current synergies. The main point here being Icahn’s belief that eBay and PayPal should have “a commercially advantageous long-term contract between the two companies.”

6) Extends PayPal product offerings. “We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace,” Icahn said, adding that the company has a “significant opportunity” to offer products such as check writing, direct deposits and interest on PayPal balances.

7) Allows for true “world-class” boards. Throw a dart and you can probably hit one of the many reasons Icahn is mad at eBay’s current board of directors, and members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook, in particular.

For its part, eBay has no plans to separate PayPal. Why should it? In 2013, PayPal accounted for $6.6 billion of eBay’s total $16 billion in sales. EBay has even set up a Web page to highlight why it thinks the two businesses are “better together.” Among the points eBay makes is that eBay is responsible for delivering 30% of PayPal’s new users and 50% of PayPal’s mobile volume.

And just before the market closed, eBay issued a statement of its own, saying “Being part of eBay Inc. for more than a decade has enabled PayPal’s strong growth and global leadership position in digital payments.” EBay added that since PayPal became part of the company, it has built relationships with the likes of Visa V, +0.01% MasterCard MA, +0.13% and Facebook FB, -1.11%

But will Icahn’s vision be clear enough to sway Wall Street, or eBay shareholders, in his favor?

“He says analysts can’t analyze the business properly, and a partial IPO would help,” said Gil Luria, who covers eBay for Wedbush Securities and has a buy rating and $70-a-share price target on eBay’s stock. “The truth is we know the revenue numbers and we have all we need to do our jobs.”



Luria admitted that Icahn’s ideas “could unlock some short-term value,” but over the long run, he thinks PayPal is more valuable with eBay.

“He certainly writes these things with an amount of humor,” said Gil Luria. “These points have been made in the past, so there’s nothing too surprising here.”

Surprising or not, neither eBay or Icahn are likely to adjust their vision of each other any time soon.

Shares of Symantec sunk 9.4% in pre-market trading Friday after the computer security firm surprised investors by firing its CEO.

On Thursday, Symantec announced it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett. Board member Michael Brown will fill his role on an interim basis while a special committee begins a search for a new CEO.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement representing Symantec's board of directors.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Symantec is sticking with its fourth-quarter forecast, which has the company raking in between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion in revenue.

Bennett's firing marks another tumble for Symantec shares since reaching a 52-week high of $26.96 on August 13. In pre-market trading, shares are below $20. The last time Symantec stock closed under $20 was January 2013.

Updated

Failed Bitcoin exchange MtGox says it has found 200,000 coins worth $US116 million ($127 million) in an old "digital wallet".

The discovery comes after the Tokyo-based currency exchange collapsed in February saying it had lost 850,000 coins, worth nearly half a billion dollars, in a possible theft.

But 200,000 Bitcoins were left in a "wallet" used before June 2011, the company said in a statement on its website.

Bitcoin wallets are used for online transactions between currency holders.

The find has been reported to the court overseeing the company's bankruptcy case, the company said.

MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 per cent of global Bitcoin transactions, said the 200,000 Bitcoins - discovered on March 7 - had been moved to an offline wallet.

"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of Bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC," the statement said.

The company filed for protection under US bankruptcy law earlier this month, 10 days after doing the same in Japan after a huge loss of the digital currency.

MtGox's lawyer said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers had gone, along with MtGox's own store of the currency, which she said was about 100,000 units.

Japanese officials say they are closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to understand how and why the exchange imploded.

The global virtual currency community was shaken by the failure of MtGox, which froze withdrawals in early February because of what the firm said was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoin that allowed hackers to pilfer them.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the world.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011.

By late 2012 a coin was worth $US40 and it reached $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $580 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

First posted###2400||Mega retailer Walmart is jumping into the used video game business, the company announced today.

Starting later this month, gamers will be able to trade in their games at Walmart and receive store credit that can be spent on anything sold at either Walmart or Sam's Club. Purchases can be made using the credit either in-store or online.

Walmart, naturally, will then resell the pre-owned games (after having them refurbished) back to consumers in a fashion presumably similar to how GameStop and Best Buy handle it now.

What do you make of this news? With the rise in popularity of digital media, might Walmart be jumping into the market a bit too late?

THE CHANCELLOR George Osborne will announce a historic change to UK currency in his Budget today: a new pound coin.The new pound will have 12-sides and is modelled on the old threepenny bit. It will be composed of two different coloured metals, like the £2 coin, and feature the Queen’s head on one side and another motif, to be decided by a competition, on the other.The change will be the first major overhaul since the pound was introduced in 1983 and is in part due to the volume of forged coins now in circulation; around three per cent of all coins, according to the Royal Mint.The pound will boast the Mint’s new iSIS technology, which will make it the most secure coin anywhere in the world. Osborne will announce the change today, alongside a consultation to determine the cost to businesses.The Bank of England welcomed the new coin, which will be introduced in 2017.###2405||New Jersey’s labor market kicked off 2014 on a few sour notes.

According to preliminary data yesterday from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state lost 3,900 jobs during the first month of the year.

Meanwhile, the state made scant progress over the past year toward returning to the peak employment levels it reached exactly six years earlier.

In January 2008, New Jersey boasted a record 4.092 million jobs, according to data provided by Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick in Roseland.

Six years on, the Garden State is more than 167,000 jobs shy of that number, as the state reported an estimated 3.925 million jobs for January. And the 5,600 jobs the state added between January 2013 and January 2014 barely closes the gap.

"In 2013, we made less progress in the recovery than we thought," said O’Keefe, a former deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor.

According to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning think tank, the state has recovered just 37 percent of the jobs it lost during the recession. New York has recovered 163 percent and Pennsylvania 78 percent.

One area where New Jersey has made significant progress is its unemployment rate. The state’s jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent in January from 8.9 percent a year earlier. This drop puts the state closer to the national average, which stood at 6.6 percent in January and climbed to 6.7 percent in February.

But as O’Keefe noted, the drop in New Jersey’s unemployment rate had little to do with people getting jobs, but rather with people dropping out of the labor force. Yesterday’s data showed that the civilian labor force — or the count of working-age people who either have a job or are looking for one — shrank by more than 100,000 over the 12-month period ending in January.

In an interview, state Labor Department Commissioner Harold Wirths said he believed the declines in the labor force are due in part to people retiring rather than just giving up on finding work. But he acknowledged that the state, with its high taxes and heavy regulation, is lagging the nation when it comes to creating jobs.

"We definitely have a lot more work to do," he said. He expects big projects such as the Pulaski Skyway overhaul and completion of the American Dream Meadowlands in East Rutherford to create more jobs.

The January data still is subject to revisions as more complete and accurate data comes in.

"These preliminary numbers almost mean nothing," said Wirths, whose department issues the monthly jobs reports derived from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The first set of revisions occur when the state issues its February jobs report on March 27. The data also may be tweaked again when it undergoes annual "benchmarking" next year, a process meant to make it more accurate.

It was this benchmarking process that state officials gave the most attention yesterday.

Along with the January jobs numbers, the Labor Department also released benchmarked numbers for 2012 and 2013. Among other things, the data showed that the state gained more jobs last year than initially estimated, and that its persistently high unemployment rate has been mostly lower than previously reported.

The average unemployment rate in New Jersey last year was 8.2 percent, rather than 8.4 percent. Meanwhile, the average jobless rate for 2012 was revised down to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent.

Meanwhile, the state added 18,800 jobs in 2013, compared to earlier estimates that it would add just 10,100 jobs. All of the job gains were in the private sector, while the public sector shed 1,000 jobs last year. Earlier estimates saw the private sector gain just 7,300 positions last year. Also, December’s job losses, initially reported at 36,300, were revised lower to 19,100 jobs lost.

However, any boost this provided was offset by the finding that 2012 provided a smaller job haul than originally reported. Yesterday’s benchmarked data showed that the state gained just 43,900 jobs in 2012, or about a third less than the 66,400 jobs originally reported for the year.

With respect to the January and December job losses, the bitter winter did play a part, Charles Steindel, chief economist for the state Department of Treasury said in a statement, though he expects this too will abate.

"As is typically the case after such an episode, there’s a good chance the pace will pick up as the temperatures rise," he wrote.###2406||New York City’s ambitious bike share program, which was touted by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and backed by Citigroup, is in deep financial trouble, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The program, which opened to the general public last June, is struggling to generate interest from tourists and has suffered from computer glitches and logistical problems, all of which has created the need for tens of millions of dollars in extra funding just to keep it afloat.

The bike-share program faced “a number of financial and operational challenges,” said Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Citi Bike has nearly 100,000 annual members who pay $95 for a year’s worth of unlimited 45-minute rides. But the program has generated very little interest from tourists and other short-term users.

Operated by a group called NYC Bike Share, which is itself owned by Alta Bicycle Share, Citi Bike offers 24-hour and 7-day access plans. Those plans are relatively more expensive at $9.95 for the day plan and $25 for the week plan.

Besides having a hard time attracting those customers, Citi Bike faces the problem of manually changing out batteries at the 330 docking stations located throughout the city. A subcontractor was hired to do the expensive work, the Wall Street Journal reports and also notes that the program’s financial struggles have led to some layoffs.

The Citi Bike program was both widely touted and criticized during its development through 2012 and 2013.

Mayor Bloomberg championed the program as an environmentally-friendly way to help New Yorkers and its 50 million-plus annual tourists get around the city. Others have complained that the bike program is discriminatory. Alta, the program’s operator, places a 260 pound weight limit on bike riders, though officials have said that the limit will not be strictly enforced. Others have argued that the program is not easily-accessible to minority customers given the locations of the bike stations.

Bloomberg also highlighted that the program is entirely privately funded. But the Wall Street Journal notes that extra financial backing may be hard to come by given that the Citi Bike program is so closely identified with its namesake Citigroup. The bank provided $41 million in seed capital to get the program off the ground, and the 10,000 bikes all bear the company’s logo.

MasterCard is also a contributor to the program, providing payment services as well as $6.5 million in financing.

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged his support on Friday for Bank Rossiya, a lender hit by U.S. sanctions which mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.

The bank and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is also one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

"Our companies will continue using the services of the bank," a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following the sanctions.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, instructed the Russian central bank to aid Bank Rossiya, if needed.

"And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand it is a medium-sized bank," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday."

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

The Russian central bank said the measures imposed by the United States would have no significant impact on the financial stability of Bank Rossiya.

"If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors," it said in a statement.

St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, the country's 15th largest in terms of assets, is chaired by Kovalchuk, a close adviser to the president. The friendship between the two men dates back to the early 1990s.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

Starting on March 26, gamers can bring their used video games into some 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a credit to spend on anything they want at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores or on the retailer’s website. The video games must be in working condition and in the original packaging, and must be brought to the electronics department where employees will evaluate them and determine a trade-in price. Customers cannot receive cash back for video games.

Walmart executives said they will accept thousands of popular video games for Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintento Wii, and will refurbish them and resell them in stores and online later this year. There more than 880 million video games being played in homes across the country.

Walmart tested a video game trade-in program in 2009 that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud. On a call with media on Monday, executives said that program was shut down and the retailer has since been working to create a simpler and fairer video buy-back system. Last fall, the Arkansas-based retailer also rolled out a trade-in program for smartphones and tablets. Walmart’s partners with CExchange, which refurbishes, recycles and assesses the value of used tech gadgets.

The American business magnate published yet another open letter to eBay shareholders on Wednesday, outlining a scheme in which eBay sells off 20 percent of PayPal through an initial public offering.

As described by Icahn, the online marketplace conglomerate would then be able to keep the majority of PayPal.

Aside from the rather lengthy proposal, Icahn reiterated his disappointment (to put it lightly) in eBay's leadership:

Over the last few weeks, we have raised a number of troubling questions regarding corporate governance at eBay. Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay. Now, we have given a basic overview of the reasons we believe a 20% IPO of PayPal could be advantageous for the companies, employees and stockholders. We hope that eBay’s management is paying attention and decides to respond to this first message on the topic in a productive, transparent manner.

Icahn concluded by stressing he believes in the value of PayPal, but warned "it is on the verge of going to war against strong adversaries, and only with the benefits of being an independent company, as described above, will PayPal be capable of winning that war."

This new suggestion regarding the future of the digital payments brand is only the latest incursion between eBay and Icahn's inventment group empire.

The trouble with eBay started in January amid the company's fourth quarter earnings report. At the time, Icahn suggested (putting it mildly) that PayPal should be spun off .

Ebay didn't agree .

By the end of February , Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of the board of eBay Inc., published a pointed letter rebuffing Icahn's public criticism of eBay CEO John Donahue as well as two prominent shareholders, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Intuit founder Scott Cook.

Since then there has been a flurry of public memos and outbursts volleyed back and forth, including one by Icahn arguing that Icahn that Andreessen had too many conflicts during the Skype sale , putting up his reputation for further scrutiny.

Then last week , eBay took things to a new level in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, urging shareholders to ignore both Icahn's nominees for the board of directors while encouraging them to re-elect CEO John Donahoe and director Fred Anderson.###2415||Empty###2416||Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed and filed for bankruptcy last month, said it had found 200,000 bitcoins that were held in an "old-format" wallet, or digital storage file.

Mt. Gox's former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement in Japanese and English on the company's website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching these wallets that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed.

Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million.

Since then, plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside of the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the bankruptcy court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site from March 14 to March 15.

The latest announcement is likely to add to the questions about Mt. Gox's collapse. Even the company said it was still uncertain about what led up to its failure.

"Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation," the company concluded in its statement dated Thursday.

Bitcoins can be stored online or offline, otherwise known as "hot" and "cold" wallets. A "cold" wallet can be nothing more than writing down a digital key to access one's bitcoin on a scrap of paper for later use, or storing data on a thumb drive.

Thieves can steal bitcoin by accessing it through a computer network, or by taking the physical storage material.

Many Bitcoin supporters have said that the collapse of Mt. Gox is part of the shake-out of the early, less sophisticated Bitcoin companies that have lost ground to newer, more well-oiled businesses.

INDIANAPOLIS – Indiana’s unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been since September 2008, but House Minority Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, said officials need to “take a longer look before gushing praise.”

According to the Department of Workforce Development, Indiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points to 6.4 percent in January. That is lower than all neighboring states and 0.2 percentage points below the national average.

“Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today’s unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement Monday. “Indiana’s rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow.”

The Hoosier state added 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector in January, the most in the country. But Indiana also lost 7,100 private sector jobs, leaving the state at a net loss of 2,500 jobs for the month.

“While others may gush about ‘the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,’ I look at the report and find myself wondering many things,” Pelath said.

He noted all but one of the state’s Metropolitan Statistical Areas – and 82 of the 92 counties – actually saw unemployment rise in January.

“These disparities only serve to heighten the concern that many of us have about the so-called ‘job creation’ engine that the governor, his administration, and his super-majorities like to tout so often,” Pelath said.

But Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center, said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the recent administration’s job creation strategies.

He said the Hoosier economy is closely tied to the national economy so these numbers may be result of the general economic upswing throughout the country.

But Conover also said Indiana has a “well-deserved” reputation as a business-friendly state. The legislature recently passed a bill that will give Indiana the lowest corporate tax rate in the country.

That lowering of the business personal property tax was one of the landmark items of the Pence agenda.

“With this legislative session’s accomplishments in cutting the corporate income tax rate, giving counties new tools for reforming the business personal property tax, and offering new opportunities for career education and retraining, we continue to work hard to ensure the future economic prosperity of our state,” Pence said.

The DWD – along with the U.S. Federal Reserve – cited January’s severe winter weather as one of the main reasons for the loss of jobs around the country.

Conover agreed with the assessment and noted that more than 9,000 jobs were lost in the areas of trade, transportation and utilities and construction alone.

But that explanation was not enough for Pelath.

“People can talk about seasonal adjustments all they want, but I continue to be concerned about the raw employment and unemployment numbers,” he said. “Those tell me who has a job and who is able to take care of their family.”

Pence agreed that there is still more work to be done.

“Amidst this good news, we know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy,” he said. “Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve Indiana’s economic climate, to attract more jobs, and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future

Turkey Tayyip erdogan###2421||Symantec has fired CEO Steve Bennett, who was in the second year of a complete overhaul of the company's product and go-to-market strategy. Some of Symantec's top partners tell CRN that the move comes as a complete shock and signals continued turmoil at the company.

The Symantec board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. The company said a special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. Symantec stock was halted temporarily following the announcement late Thursday. It dropped as much as 10 percent in after-hours trading.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said Daniel Schulman, chairman of Symantec's board of directors, in a statement. "Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum.

Bennett was appointed CEO in July 2012, replacing Enrique Salem, who served in the position for three years but oversaw mediocre financial results. Bennett unveiled Symantec 4.0 in January 2013, which prompted a year of internal transition, including the layoff of hundreds of employees. He focused on overhauling the go-to-market strategy, impacting roughly 90 percent of the sales force. He told CRN last month that the company was preparing to unveil a product road map that included integrated parts of the security portfolio, but admitted that 2014 would be another year of transition. Symantec's third-quarter revenue, released in January, fell to $1.71 billion from $1.79 billion, a year earlier.

A Symantec Platinum-level partner, speaking on condition of anonymity, had been enthusiastic about the changes instituted by Bennett. The company was transitioning to rely more heavily on a select group of 100 or so U.S. partners, including the partner's firm.

"I admit this has me completely shocked. We have been getting so much about the need to buy into the 4.0 strategy," the partner told CRN. "The fact that there has been so much turnover and transition in such a short period of time will raise some question marks in the minds of our customers."

NEXT: Partners Express Dismay

Bennett's vision focused on creating a more integrated product portfolio but lacked specifics, said David Sockol, president and CEO of San Carlos, Calif.-based Emagined Security. Bennett focused on the transition rather than showing exactly where the company was truly going, Sockol said.

"They focused on how cool it was that the company was changing rather than what they were changing to," Sockol said. "Even the employees were having trouble with the vision; it all focused with the fact that it was changing."

Partners were growing increasingly frustrated that they haven't seen new products or more details about better integrated products, said Alex Moss, managing partner at Chicago-based consultancy Conventus, a Symantec partner. Products being introduced have long been on the road map and already anticipated, Moss said.

"Bennett moves very slowly, and that affected the partners as well as the customers," Moss said. "I think everybody was getting tired of waiting."

Jacob Tukuru, president of Tukuru Technologies, a Symantec partner based in New York, said there were some improvements, including internal streamlining, that made it easier for partners to do business with the company.

"It's a little surprising. I know from our perspective as a partner, things have improved over the last year," Tukuru said. "They made it easier to do business with them as a partner, and we use their cloud products, which are great. Before, it was very difficult to work with Symantec. They made it hard to get information about simple things like software licenses, and it was really hard to find the right technical support."

"This comes totally out of the blue. I'm shocked," said Michael Goldstein, president and CEO of LAN Infotech, a Symantec partner based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "From a partner perspective it's discouraging. We have just been hearing Symantec trumpet its turnaround plan, new products and how bright the future looked. Now, just as it feels like we are nearing the top of the Symantec mountain, Bennett is terminated? Now it feels like we are back to square one."

Goldstein said he was unaware of what led to Bennett's departure or what interim CEO Michael Brown might be able to do to lead the company. Brown's storage background, Goldstein said, is encouraging however. "The only silver lining is Brown might bring Symantec's storage products up to date. Symantec's Backup Exec is way behind the times. It doesn't even support Microsoft Server 2012," Goldstein said.

Airbnb has had some pretty bad publicity lately, but investors don't seem to be freaked.

The home rental startup is in talks to raise funding that would value the company at $10 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report published today.

The round, which will likely be led by private-equity firm TPG, is estimated to raise between $400 and $500 million.

Not only would a $10 billion valuation put Airbnb at the top of a list of the most highly venture-backed companies (joining Dropbox and Chinese mobile-phone maker Xiaomi), it would also mean the San Francisco-based home sharing service is valued more highly than some of the hotel chains it competes against, including Hyatt Hotels at $8.4 billion.

Word of the new funding round comes on the heels of a recent crop of horror stories from Airbnb hosts. Last month, Rachel Bassini used the site to rent out her New York City penthouse; she returned to find the place epically trashed (the details are both grimy and well documented). And just this past weekend, Ari Teman gave his keys to a renter before promptly discovering that said renter was using his place to host an orgy (you can read Teman's full account of the ordeal in his blog post entitled "Dear AirBnB, No Thank You for the XXX Freak Fest").

Rental disaster stories like these two, along with continued pushback from regulators, has consistently plagued the company. Ultimately, both hosts were refunded for damages incurred but that didn't stop their horrifying accounts from spreading like wildfire.

It’s clearly not enough to scare away investors, however.

While Airbnb hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability, it currently has more than 600,000 listings in 160 countries. And according to the WSJ, Brian Chesky, the company's chief executive, has major plans for continued expansion; he has indicated that he would like to add more hospitality services, taking the platform beyond simply home and apartment rentals. Earlier this year, for example, Airbnb began testing a cleaning service for hosts in certain neighborhoods in San Francisco and New York.

"We are actively looking to build specific services," Mr. Chesky told the WSJ in January. "We need to offer more."

* Bank’s clients include businesses owned by Gazprom

* Timchenko, also hit by U.S. sanctions, has stake in lender (Adds comments, background)

By Lidia Kelly and Oksana Kobzeva

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged support on Friday to a secretive bank long-associated with the Kremlin that was hit by U.S. sanctions and which serves clients in Russia’s energy sector, including businesses owned by Gazprom.

Bank Rossiya, and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk, were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin’s close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world’s largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, played down his association with the bank, but ordered the central bank to support the lender.

“And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand, it is a medium-sized bank,” he told a meeting of Russia’s Security Council. “I personally don’t have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday.”

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

OBSCURE BUT POWERFUL

Little has been known about Bank Rossiya, which has risen to become the country’s 15th largest bank by assets last year from 54th in just six years.

Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder in the St Petersburg-based bank is a close Putin ally. The friendship between the two dates back to the early 1990s, when Putin served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

Kovalchuk was also one of the three founding members of the Ozero (Lake) luxury dachas complex outside St Petersburg who were targeted by the U.S. sanctions

“Kovalchuk ... Timchenko ... I think I need to stay away from them,” Putin joked on Friday.

The bank’s operations are concentrated around St Petersburg and Moscow, serving chiefly clients in oil, gas and energy. The bank also controls large insurance firms Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom’s businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

“Our companies will continue using the services of the bank,” a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

According to the bank’s most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank’s corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

The bank paid 106.5 roubles ($2.94) per ordinary share in dividends on 2012 earnings for a total payout of 267.1 million roubles ($7.37 million), suggesting that Kovalchuk got $1 million in dividends for his stake.

According to a 2008 article by the business daily Vedomosti, nearly 4 percent of the bank belonged to a distant cousin of Putin, Mikhail Shelomov.

One of the bank’s clients, the state electricity holding firm InterRAO is run by Kovalchuk’s son Boris Kovalchuk.

“We have small rouble deposits and an insignificant loan burden, in both roubles and foreign currency, but settlements for the latter are made in roubles,” Anton Nazarov, a representative of InteRAO told Reuters, without disclosing the amounts.

Three of the bank’s clients, the utility holdings FSK , Moscow United Electric Grid Co. (MOESK) and the grid company Rosseti, told Reuters they hold only rouble accounts at the bank.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following Washington’s sanctions. Western Union the world’s largest money transfer company, has also suspended its services for the bank.

“The bank has a strong liquidity cushion and the imposed sanctions will not affect the company’s operations,” Bank Rossiya said in a statement late on Friday.

“Currently, there is no area (of the bank’s operation) that would require assistance from the Central Bank.”

The Russian central bank said that it stood ready to support the sanctions-hit bank. “If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors,” it said in a statement.###2431||Empty###2432||Empty###2433||Stocks surged for the second straight day today, making last week's slide a distant memory, as remarks from Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed markets. Putin said he did not wish to seize further parts of Ukraine, but still defied Western protests by formally declaring Crimea as part of Russia. Investors, however, seemed to be glad that the crisis is contained to the peninsular region for now as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished up 89 points or 0.6%, and the S&P 500 approached its record high once again, climbing 0.7%.

In other macroeconomic news, housing data was positive as February housing starts at 909,000 were roughly in line with estimates, but building permits, a leading indicator for the sector, jumped to 1.02 million, well ahead of January's total of 945,000 and better than expectations at 955,000. Data also showed that last month's Consumer Price Index increased 0.1%, indicating that inflation continues to be under control.

Leading the blue chips' gains today was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jumped 4%, hitting $39.55, or its highest point since 2000. The jump came on rumors that the software giant would introduce a version of its Office suite. According to Reuters, new CEO Satya Nadella could make the announcement at a March 27 event. Investors reacted well to the news as Office is Microsoft's most profitable product, but the decision could undercut sales of Microsoft's own Surface tablet, which runs on Windows and comes with Office installed. Still, analysts estimate that the Windows-maker is forgoing $2.5 billion a year by not making Office for the iPad. Considering the Surface has undersold expectations, perhaps the iPad strategy is the better direction.

Elsewhere on the Dow, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) said it wanted to get into the used video game business. The retail giant said starting March 26 it will allow customers to trade in used video games for credit on purchases at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart said it would refurbish the old games and sell them in "like-new condition." Investors did not have a strong reaction to the news, as used video games are just a $2 billion business, and Wal-Mart's entry is unlikely to be meaningful to its bottom line. Shares moved up just 0.1%, but when the world's largest retailer enters a new business there are bound to be consequences. Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME), the No. 1 retailer of new and used video games, fell as much as 6% and finished down 3.4% on the news. The effects of Wal-Mart's are unclear, but GameStop benefits from a smaller store format that is often more accessible and staff specialized in video games. Considering Best Buy and Target already offer such programs, I wouldn't expect the move to have an immediate impact on GameStop.###2434||The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline.

Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin's entourage.

Fears over Russia's economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country annexed Crimea following Sunday's hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin's inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin's chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin's lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury's sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia's 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services "without prior notification." SMP's co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia's top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard's actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won't be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank's. They can also get cash directly inside their banks' branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country's central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to "take the bank's clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them."

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin's close entourage, as "just an average bank," Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one "first thing on Monday" and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia's central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. "does not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor's in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia's debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia's BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country's borrowing costs more expensive.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov lambasted the move, saying it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

Banning Twitter in Turkey is a violation of democratic rights, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party Kemal Kılıcdaroglu was reported as saying on March 21, Anadolu agency reported.

"The ruling party elected by the people has no right to take such an action," he added.

Access was blocked a few hours after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a statement about such a possibility.

He has recently said that if necessary, the agenda may include the issue of banning the use of Youtube and Facebook to protect its citizens from external influences. However Turkish President Abdullah Gul stressed the impossibility of banning their use.

The Turkish President also said that a complete ban on Twitter is out of the question.

Follow Trend on Telegram. Only most interesting and important news###2437||Empty###2438||Empty###2439||Empty###2440||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — It’s no secret that Carl Icahn has had a vision of which way eBay Inc. should go with its PayPal electronics-payment business.

And on Wednesday, that vision got a little clearer. If your idea of perfect vision is 80/20, anyway.

That’s the view Icahn believes eBay EBAY, -0.77% should have with regards to PayPal. Specifically, he called for eBay to sell off 20% of PayPal in a public-stock offering and maintain an 80% ownership stake in the business. Icahn made his views known in what may be his longest screed since he began battling with eBay over PayPal, and certain members of the eBay board of directors several weeks ago.

“We believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal – and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses – will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,” Icahn wrote in his latest open letter to eBay shareholders. “The 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the “secret sauce” and “flywheels” would be preserved.

Icahn, who owns about 2% of eBay’s stock, gave what might as well be called his “seven points” for why he thinks it makes sense for eBay to spin off 20% of PayPal into a separate, publicly traded company. In a nutshell, Icahn said such a move:

1) Highlights value. “A separation of the businesses will allow investors and analysts to more clearly see the value” of what Icahn called PayPal’s sustainable double-digit growth and eBay’s strong free cash flow.

2) Focuses management teams. This has been a big one for Icahn, who has repeatedly said the “inexcusable incompetence” of eBay’s management has cost its shareholders billions of dollars.

3) Creates a valuable currency for acquisitions and attracting top talent. Icahn noted eBay’s recent $800 million purchase of Braintree in order to incorporate its payments processes with PayPal, but said PayPal’s stock would be “a more valuable currency” on its own for incorporating advantages in the payments business. Icahn went on to say that “PayPal employees will be more motivated when the company operates independently of eBay.”

4) Prevent dissynergies. Icahn hinted that PayPal, by being so tied to eBay, is unable to pursue potential strategic partnerships with the likes of Google Inc. GOOG, -1.67% and Facebook Inc. FB, -1.11%

5) Preserves current synergies. The main point here being Icahn’s belief that eBay and PayPal should have “a commercially advantageous long-term contract between the two companies.”

6) Extends PayPal product offerings. “We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace,” Icahn said, adding that the company has a “significant opportunity” to offer products such as check writing, direct deposits and interest on PayPal balances.

7) Allows for true “world-class” boards. Throw a dart and you can probably hit one of the many reasons Icahn is mad at eBay’s current board of directors, and members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook, in particular.

For its part, eBay has no plans to separate PayPal. Why should it? In 2013, PayPal accounted for $6.6 billion of eBay’s total $16 billion in sales. EBay has even set up a Web page to highlight why it thinks the two businesses are “better together.” Among the points eBay makes is that eBay is responsible for delivering 30% of PayPal’s new users and 50% of PayPal’s mobile volume.

And just before the market closed, eBay issued a statement of its own, saying “Being part of eBay Inc. for more than a decade has enabled PayPal’s strong growth and global leadership position in digital payments.” EBay added that since PayPal became part of the company, it has built relationships with the likes of Visa V, +0.01% MasterCard MA, +0.13% and Facebook FB, -1.11%

But will Icahn’s vision be clear enough to sway Wall Street, or eBay shareholders, in his favor?

“He says analysts can’t analyze the business properly, and a partial IPO would help,” said Gil Luria, who covers eBay for Wedbush Securities and has a buy rating and $70-a-share price target on eBay’s stock. “The truth is we know the revenue numbers and we have all we need to do our jobs.”



Luria admitted that Icahn’s ideas “could unlock some short-term value,” but over the long run, he thinks PayPal is more valuable with eBay.

“He certainly writes these things with an amount of humor,” said Gil Luria. “These points have been made in the past, so there’s nothing too surprising here.”

Surprising or not, neither eBay or Icahn are likely to adjust their vision of each other any time soon.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank’s monthly poll of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts. The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

A ZEW economist said the Ukraine crisis had played a “very important part” in the indictor’s decline.

The index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said. A separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0.###2445||Honestly, the idea behind Airbnb makes me really uncomfortable. I barely like having people I know in my place when I'm there, forget about trusting strangers when I'm not around. I read stories like this and it freaks me out to think just what someone might do to my place, and to my stuff.

I seem to be in the minority here, though, because the service has become incredibly popular over the last few years. It took Airbnb four years to serve its first four million guests, and then another five million in just a few months.

And now it looks to be raising a gigantic new funding round, at an astounding valuation.

The the online home-rental company is in "advanced talks" to raise a new round worth between $400 million and $500 million, according to a report out from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Private-equity firm TPG is said to be leading the round.

If true, the new round would bring the company's value to more than $10 billion. It would also more than double Airbnb's previous fundings put together.

Airbnb has raised $326 million altogether at a $2.5 billion valuation, including a $117 million Series B round from Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global and General Catalyst and, most recently, a $200 million Series C round from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst Partners, Crunchfund, Ashton Kutcher, and Founders Fund in 2012.

This latest round would bring Airbnb’s total funding to between $726 million and $826 million, and place it among the world's most valuable startups.

How much money Airbnb makes has not been divulged, but private company analyst Privco has estimated Airbnb’s 2012 revenue to be $189 million. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter forecasted at the beginning of last year that it won’t be long before Airbnb is pulling in $1 billion in revenue per year.

Since its founding in 2008, Airbnb has served more than 11 million total guests. In now operates in over 34,000 cities in 192 countries and has over 600,000 listings around the world.

Recently, the company has been looking to expand beyond ts current room rental service and into more hospitality services. In January it announced that it was piloting a cleaning service in certain zip codes of San Francisco and New York City, where hosts can arrange a cleaning of their listing prior to a guest’s check-in.

The cleanings are arranged by Handybook and Homejoy, and the cost of the cleaning service is taken from the renter's payout for the reservation.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 18 (Reuters) - Drought-plagued California will ease some protection for fish in the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, officials said Tuesday, a move expected to make more water available for farming and ease political tensions in an election year.

The move marks a retreat from restrictions imposed earlier in the year which had widely been expected to be tightened further, rather than eased, and was welcomed in the agricultural community.

"California's agriculture is critical to the world's food supply," said assemblywoman Kristin Olsen, who represents part of the San Joaquin Valley, who had lobbied hard against the restrictions. "An inability to produce that food would clearly be devastating to health and human safety not only in California but around the globe."

Citing recent rains, regulators said Tuesday there was enough water in the state's reservoirs now to partially ease restrictions.

"We were quite concerned at that time about the issue of public health and safety," Tom Howard, executive director of the state Water Resources Control Board, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. "This really had the markings of a historic drought."

The move comes after weeks of intensive lobbying from growers, lawmakers from agricultural regions and the state's two U.S. Senators, who said the restrictions, along with the possible curtailment of water rights for some agricultural and municipal customers, would harm the state's economy.

The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of a drought that may still turn out to be one of the worst in its history despite storms that brought rain and snow last week, leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water and possibly forcing farmers to leave fallow a half-million acres (202,000 hectares) of land.

Recent storms dropped nearly a foot (30 cm) of rain in some areas, boosting reservoir levels and the snowpack that the state relies on for drinking water in the spring, but still leaving supplies way below normal for this time of year.

Earlier this month, concern that the state was about to restrict water supplies to farmers even further swept through the agricultural community, spurring intensive pushback and a series of tense meetings with water regulators in the administration of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

"We are very concerned that if the current proposal as reported to us is enacted, it will have significant near- and long-term effects on the California economy and, more importantly, will not achieve the desired water supply security intended," U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jim Costa and John Garamendi, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to the water board.

CUTBACKS STILL POSSIBLE

Under the new rules announced Tuesday, which Howard said may be modified again next month, the two massive public water projects responsible for pumping in the delta will be able to deliver it to farmers and others, once the state determines that there is enough flowing to meet the health and sanitation needs of residents.

Scott Shapiro, an attorney specializing in water issues for the Sacramento firm Downey Brand, said expanding the allowable uses of tight water supplies was not just important for farmers.

"It's not just for agriculture, because there are other needs that may be contracted for that go beyond health and safety," Shapiro said. "It could include other municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.

In addition to allowing more of the water pumped from the delta to be used for purposes other than meeting health and safety needs, the state planned to reduce by about a third the amount of water that the projects were required to leave in the delta as a way of protecting fish, Howard said during the press briefing.

But he cautioned that the state could still implement severe cutbacks to the water rights of many users if dry conditions continue.

Environmental groups, long critical of what they say is over-use of the state's limited water resources for farming in dry areas, did not immediately respond to the rules change.###2448||Though it may seem an odd choice in the era of digital downloads and consoles that very-nearly abolished used games altogether, Wal-Mart has announced that it plans to begin accepting game trade-ins as soon as March 26th in 3,100 of its stores.

The news comes via GameSpot, who attended a recent Wal-Mart conference call hosted by Duncan Mac Naughton, the company’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. Though the service should offer a potentially interesting alternative to GameStop and Best Buy, there is a catch: you can only trade for store credit.

Of course, Wal-Mart doesn’t see this as a bad thing, and maybe you shouldn’t either. Because Wal-Mart sells such a wide range of products, you really can buy anything you’d like with the store credit. While you can also do this with the cash you get from GameStop, it does require leaving and heading to another store. Also, it remains to be seen if Wal-Mart’s credits will amount to more cash than GameStop generally offers. If so, they may be on to something.

Traded games will be refurbished by a third party company, and there will be a set process to how a game is exchanged. GameSpot detailed the process in their report, as can be seen below.

Here’s how Wal-Mart’s used-game program works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

We’ll be sure to post more info as it develops.

After the bell, shares had taken off 5.4% to $36.81.

The enterprise software developer recorded revenue of $9.3 billion in the three months to February, a 4% year-over-year increase. However, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast slightly-higher sales of $9.36 billion.

Adjusted net income of 68 cents a share fell short of consensus by 2 cents.

A strengthening U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and exchange rate changes in Venezuela negatively impacted earning power, the company said in a statement.

The board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share. The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of April 8 with payment on April 29.

INDIANAPOLIS – Indiana’s unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been since September 2008, but House Minority Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, said officials need to “take a longer look before gushing praise.”

According to the Department of Workforce Development, Indiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points to 6.4 percent in January. That is lower than all neighboring states and 0.2 percentage points below the national average.

“Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today’s unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement Monday. “Indiana’s rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow.”

The Hoosier state added 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector in January, the most in the country. But Indiana also lost 7,100 private sector jobs, leaving the state at a net loss of 2,500 jobs for the month.

“While others may gush about ‘the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,’ I look at the report and find myself wondering many things,” Pelath said.

He noted all but one of the state’s Metropolitan Statistical Areas – and 82 of the 92 counties – actually saw unemployment rise in January.

“These disparities only serve to heighten the concern that many of us have about the so-called ‘job creation’ engine that the governor, his administration, and his super-majorities like to tout so often,” Pelath said.

But Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center, said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the recent administration’s job creation strategies.

He said the Hoosier economy is closely tied to the national economy so these numbers may be result of the general economic upswing throughout the country.

But Conover also said Indiana has a “well-deserved” reputation as a business-friendly state. The legislature recently passed a bill that will give Indiana the lowest corporate tax rate in the country.

That lowering of the business personal property tax was one of the landmark items of the Pence agenda.

“With this legislative session’s accomplishments in cutting the corporate income tax rate, giving counties new tools for reforming the business personal property tax, and offering new opportunities for career education and retraining, we continue to work hard to ensure the future economic prosperity of our state,” Pence said.

The DWD – along with the U.S. Federal Reserve – cited January’s severe winter weather as one of the main reasons for the loss of jobs around the country.

Conover agreed with the assessment and noted that more than 9,000 jobs were lost in the areas of trade, transportation and utilities and construction alone.

But that explanation was not enough for Pelath.

“People can talk about seasonal adjustments all they want, but I continue to be concerned about the raw employment and unemployment numbers,” he said. “Those tell me who has a job and who is able to take care of their family.”

Pence agreed that there is still more work to be done.

“Amidst this good news, we know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy,” he said. “Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve Indiana’s economic climate, to attract more jobs, and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future

Though the company thinks only 25,000 were hit, but why this keeps happening is the real question.

Sally Beauty Stores Another Victim of Data Breach, 25,000 Customers Affected

Sally Beauty Supply is a beauty supply store that sells professional beauty products usually only sold to salons, to the public. It is a publicly traded company that has over 4,000 stores in many countries.

The breach was discovered on March 5 and is believed to have only affected 25,000 customer’s debit and credit card information. The company is looking into the breach with a private investigation firm and the U.S. Secret Service to make sure that the right precautions are taken to prevent future breaches and protect those whose information has already been compromised.

Security breaches on consumer information have become all too familiar lately and are making consumers wary of where they shop. Around Christmas time, Target had a large data breach into the information of their customers as well and it seemed like the breaches kept coming through ever since. What consumers once believed to be secure systems to make purchases with, have been proven otherwise in the last few months. Will new systems be put into place for retail stores to become more secure? As less and less people tend to use paper money, it is certain something needs to be done.

GameStop GME, -3.97% shares dropped 3.1%. The move came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.55% said it would allow customers to hand in used videogames in exchange for gift cards, which can be used in its retail stores or online. The change in policy from Wal-Mart Stores could eat away at GameStop’s dominance of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S. Wal-Mart shares are up marginally.

Microsoft MSFT, +1.27% shares rose 4.3%. Analysts at Barclays hiked the stock’s price target to $44 from $43. “Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365. It can drive better earnings growth as it transitions its ubiquitous on-premise install bases (Office and Windows Server) to its cloud platforms,” analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a report. Barclays rates the stock at overweight.

Decliners

Bloomberg GameStop shares are sliding.

NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +2.02% shares fell 3.1%. The exchange operator will host an investor’s day on March 27. Analysts from Jefferies who recently met with Nasdaq executives said the management is upbeat about Nasdaq OMX NLX, its derivatives platform.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. KORS, +0.02% slid 2.2%. Analysts at Barclays initiated coverage of the U.S. luxury sector with a positive industry outlook but Michael Kors was issued an underweight rating.

Gainers

Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ, +0.04% shares added 3.7%. The stock’s rating was raised to overweight from equalweight and its price target hiked to $38 versus $33 at Barclays on Tuesday.

SanDisk Corp. US:SNDK shares gained 4.4%. The stock will be added to the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index on March 24. The index is composed of 100 tech and telecommunications companies that regularly pay a dividend.

Shares of United States Steel Corp. X, +3.18% rose 5.3%. Analysts at Nomura lowered U.S. Steel’s first-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to 35 cents from 40 cents. The stock is rated a buy with a target price of $32. The stock is down 14% year to date.

Tickers to Watch

TSLA: Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, -1.45% rose 2.3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the stock’s six-month price target to $200, which is still below its current trading level of $239.

MSG: Madison Square Garden Co. MSG, +4.54% shares are up 0.8%. The entertainment company said Tuesday that it named Phil Jackson, one of the successful coaches in the NBA history, as president of the New York Knicks. Jackson won two championships as a player with the Knicks in 1970 and 1973. He also coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles and the Los Angeles Lakers to five titles.

HTZ: Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, +5.08% shares edged up 0.1%. The company said Tuesday it received board approval to proceed with a spinoff of its equipment-rental business that is expected to close by early next year. The new company will be called HERC, the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, while Hertz will retain the rental-car businesses. Hertz said it will receive about $2.5 billion in proceeds from the spinoff that will be used to pay down debt and fund a new $1 billion stock buyback program.

At the same time, Hertz said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed as revenue rose to $2.56 billion, with its adjusted per-share earnings coming in at 26 cents. But results fell short of analyst expectations compiled by FactSet.

THC: Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, +0.11% rose 1.6%. Analysts at Mizuho said they would be buyers of hospital stocks like Tenet due to the sector’s recent weakness on changes related to individual mandate exemption rules and earnings. “We do not think either issue will have a meaningful negative impact on our EPS estimates for the hospital group,” the analysts said in a note. Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, +0.52% climbed 3.4% and HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, +0.68% advanced 2.2%.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for the tax administration.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

"This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen," George said in a statement. "The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming."

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected. The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the IG's office said.

The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of Social Security numbers, and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.###2467||Empty###2468||Empty###2469||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

At the same time, the US central bank said dropping a promise to hold rates steady “well past the time” the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5% did not indicate any change in the Fed’s policy intentions.

Wall Street reacted with a modest sell-off with major indexes falling to session lows shortly after the statement from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets—the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015,” said Thomas di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.

The benchmark 10-year treasury notes yield rose 7.5 basis points to 2.753% while the 5-year notes yields surged 12 basis points to 1.67%.

The 3-year treasuries yields rose 10.5 basis points to 0.862%, the highest level since January.

In the currency market, the euro and the yen extended losses against the dollar.

The central bank proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of the US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.79 points or 0.3%, to 16,287.4, the S&P 500 lost 4.43 points or 0.24%, to 1,867.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.02 points or 0.25%, to 4,322.293.

The FTSEurofirst 300 edged down 0.03%, at 1,305.68 points, while the euro zone’s blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index was up 0.2% at 3,078.78 points. Reuters###2474||Empty###2475||Pass, pass, pass! That was the happy result for nearly every financial institution that underwent the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress tests, the key results of which were released yesterday. Essentially, the tests are a series of measurements gauging how the selected companies would perform financially under a set of increasingly dire economic circumstances.

If the results are any indication, they'd do just fine. Of the 30 institutions in the Fed's examination room (up from 18 last year), only a single one -- Utah-based regional lender Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) -- would lack the capital to survive the Fed's worst-case economic scenario.

This, of course, provides hope that the more high-profile financials on the market will have scope to raise their dividends and/or share buyback programs. This will be determined when the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (yeah, try saying that ten times fast) is released next Wednesday afternoon by the Fed. This is the second and perhaps more critical part of the tests, as it will include the Fed's approvals (or lack thereof) to the banks' capital distribution plans.

Two lenders busy biting their nails and pacing the room in anticipation are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Investors in the two incumbents are starving for an increase in their quarterly dividends, which have stood at $0.01 per share for both firms for longer than anyone cares to remember. The chances are higher for Bank of America to get the nod for such increases, as it had an excellent year in 2013 and continues to thrive. Citigroup is doing better than it has in some time, but still has some fat to shed before it can return to meaningful growth and profitability.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is in the Bank of America club of 2013 overachievers. Although it's been struggling with a slowdown in the mortgage market of late, it's still very far in the black in terms of bottom line and the market remains quite bullish on its prospects. The company has admitted that it is seeking hikes in both its dividend and its share repurchase program; at this point, it'd be surprising if the Fed said no to either.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), for one, will have a few more coins to hand out in dividends or buybacks (assuming, of course, that it's requested a lift in either and the Fed turns on the green light). The bank finally sold its physical commodities trading unit, nearly a year after announcing it was "pursuing strategic alternatives" for the division. The buyer is Switzerland-based Mercuria Energy Group, and the price is $3.5 billion.

This weekend will be a long one for the banks. CCAR Wednesday can't come fast enough. When it does, though, expect at least a few lenders to pop open the Champagne and get good and drunk; at least a few of them should have something to celebrate.###2476||Empty###2477||Oh no! Page not found

The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

"I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years," Davis said in a short statement.

"He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he added.###2479||Automaker Toyota has reached a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over the company’s handling of consumer complaints related to unintended vehicle acceleration. CNN reported the agreement would be announced this week, and Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges.

A Toyota spokeswoman told CNN, “Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years … During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization and we are committed to continued improvements.”

For the last four years, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan had been investigation allegations that Toyota had misled U.S. authorities after consumer complaints were made about unintended acceleration in its vehicles. As a result of the complaints, Toyota recalled millions of vehicles since 2009. The company has already paid more than $1 billion last year to resolve claims related to the recall.

The potential settlement was first reported by the Wall Street Journal which mentioned, according to its sources, that the settlement would allow Toyota to avoid criminal charges and that an independent monitor will be appointed to manage Toyota’s compliance with the terms of the settlement.

Currently, hundreds of civil lawsuits are pending in the matter and the company is still under an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The “sudden acceleration” issue gained public attention when in 2009 an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer and his family were killed in a crash. The cause was believed to be the gas pedal getting stuck under the floor mat of the car. The officer made desperate calls to 911 prior to the crash and pleaded for advice on how to stop the car. The car went up to 120 mph, then flew off the road and burst into flames, instantly killing everyone inside.

Following the investigations, Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles globally, even though the automaker continues to deny any fault in its systems, and pins blame on driver error or sticky gas pedals.

In a similar report on Wednesday, the US business daily Wall Street Journal also said a settlement to this amount was discussed, but according to unnamed sources was still likely to fall apart.

A spokeswoman for Toyota told CNN that the Japanese carmaker had cooperated with the US Attorney's Office in this matter for four years.

"During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements," the spokeswoman said. Both CNN and Wall Street Journal said the US Justice Department was not available for comment.

In 2009, Toyota started a series of massive recalls involving more than 10 million cars, mostly in the United States. The problems involved faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats that had led to unintended acceleration of its cars.

The US Attorney's Office has been investigating allegations Toyota had misled US authorities after the complaints. Between 2010 and 2012, the company already paid $66 million in fines for delays in reporting its safety problems.

Just recently, the Justice Department has started a probe into whether US automaker General Motors was slow in recalling cars with a defect linked to 13 deaths.

uhe/mz (AP, Reuters)###2481||Empty###2482||Stocks surged for the second straight day today, making last week's slide a distant memory, as remarks from Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed markets. Putin said he did not wish to seize further parts of Ukraine, but still defied Western protests by formally declaring Crimea as part of Russia. Investors, however, seemed to be glad that the crisis is contained to the peninsular region for now as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished up 89 points or 0.6%, and the S&P 500 approached its record high once again, climbing 0.7%.

In other macroeconomic news, housing data was positive as February housing starts at 909,000 were roughly in line with estimates, but building permits, a leading indicator for the sector, jumped to 1.02 million, well ahead of January's total of 945,000 and better than expectations at 955,000. Data also showed that last month's Consumer Price Index increased 0.1%, indicating that inflation continues to be under control.

Leading the blue chips' gains today was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jumped 4%, hitting $39.55, or its highest point since 2000. The jump came on rumors that the software giant would introduce a version of its Office suite. According to Reuters, new CEO Satya Nadella could make the announcement at a March 27 event. Investors reacted well to the news as Office is Microsoft's most profitable product, but the decision could undercut sales of Microsoft's own Surface tablet, which runs on Windows and comes with Office installed. Still, analysts estimate that the Windows-maker is forgoing $2.5 billion a year by not making Office for the iPad. Considering the Surface has undersold expectations, perhaps the iPad strategy is the better direction.

Elsewhere on the Dow, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) said it wanted to get into the used video game business. The retail giant said starting March 26 it will allow customers to trade in used video games for credit on purchases at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart said it would refurbish the old games and sell them in "like-new condition." Investors did not have a strong reaction to the news, as used video games are just a $2 billion business, and Wal-Mart's entry is unlikely to be meaningful to its bottom line. Shares moved up just 0.1%, but when the world's largest retailer enters a new business there are bound to be consequences. Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME), the No. 1 retailer of new and used video games, fell as much as 6% and finished down 3.4% on the news. The effects of Wal-Mart's are unclear, but GameStop benefits from a smaller store format that is often more accessible and staff specialized in video games. Considering Best Buy and Target already offer such programs, I wouldn't expect the move to have an immediate impact on GameStop.###2483||Alta Bicycle Share, the company contracted to run Portland’s much-delayed $4 million bike-sharing system, has responded to a report that its New York City network is going broke by saying it is seeking help from investors.

Without directly addressing the Wall Street Journal story, in which sources partially blame Alta for the 10-month-old Citi Bike system’s financial woes, the Portland-based company explained that it has “grown tremendously” over the past four years.

“We are seeking outside investors to help continue to accelerate the growth of our company as we continue to improve service for our existing clients and expand our existing systems,” Alta’s e-mail statement said.

It's unclear if the company is seeking financial support for just Citi Bike or its entire bike-sharing division.



The company, run by former city of Portland bike planner Mia Birk, also said bike sharing in U.S. cities and around the world remains strong. Alta already runs eight bike-sharing programs in the U.S. and Australia.



“Bike share systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco are growing and expanding, with more users and more trips every year,” the company said.

However, the Wall Street Journal paints a troubling picture of Citi Bike frantically trying to raise tens of millions of dollars “to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money.”

The story says that Citi Bike “has been forced to contend with a number of costly issues.” Among them: superstorm Sandy beating up equipment, software bugs and a rough winter that discouraged ridership.

Bike share pricing Portland has yet to announce the pricing for its proposed bike-sharing system. Here's the pricing for Citi Bike in New York City. * $95-a-year membership (with unlimited 45-minute rides). * $25 for a seven days. * $9.99 for 24 hours.

At the same time, advocates told the Journal that Alta hadn't done enough to improve the system and has basically ignored problems as they popped up. The story cites Alta's failure to get the bikes where they need to be, problems loading new batteries into charging stations and layoffs hampering customer service.

Alta's bike-sharing system in Portland would have 75 stations with 750 bikes, mostly in Portland’s central city.



One thing that should give Portland officials pause: Tourists aren't using Citi Bike as much as New York City had hoped. And when they do, many reportedly can't even use their credit cards with the high-tech sharing stations.

An analysis by The Oregonian earlier this month showed Portland is counting heavily on tourists to keep the local bike-sharing system afloat when it launches.

The Portland Bureau of Transportation has not responded to The Oregonian’s request for comment.



However, in a text message, Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees the bureau, said Portland is being deliberate about starting bike sharing. One reason is "that it gives us a chance to learn from other cities, so we'll see what we can learn from what's happening in New York," Novick said.



"Part of the problem in New York was the software, and we are using different software that has gotten good reviews from the other cities that have it," Novick said. "I talked to Mia (Birk) and asked her about the tourist issue, and she doesn't think it's true that tourist usage in NYC has been way lower than expected; I asked her for numbers and she said she'd get them to me."

Earlier this month, a messy bankruptcy involving an equipment supplier prompted Portland to once again delay launching the system in Alta’s hometown until 2015.

Alta made only a passing reference to Citi Bike’s financial problems. Instead, the company’s statement to The Oregonian focused primarily on the system’s popularity and growth:

“New York's Citi Bike has proven particularly successful. (Seven hundred) people joined in the last week alone, even with near freezing temperatures in New York. Citi Bike currently has over 99,000 Annual Members and average daily ridership of over 36,000 trips per day during the summer and fall. We look forward to working with our partners at the City of New York to ensure the program to continues to be a success, and to expand this convenient, healthy and fun form of transportation for all New Yorkers.”

It requested that future questions be directed to the New York City Department of Transportation.

On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Alta shouldn't count on the nation's largest city to pour money into Citi Bike.

Unlike Portland, which is depending on government grant funding to cover half of its bike-sharing project's startup costs, New York was able to get Citi Bike up and running with corporate sponsorships from CitiBank and MasterCard.

Meanwhile, David Bragdon, the former Metro Council president who now works as an executive director of Transit Center, Inc. in New York, took to Twitter to defend bike-sharing, pointing out that the nation’s highway fund is about to go belly up.

According to a New York City bicyclist and bike shop worker named “Matthew,” who sent an email to The Oregonian on Friday morning, Portland bicycle businesses should also be concerned about Alta setting up its rental kiosks.



He asked that his last name not be published.



His email also pointed out what he saw as problems with Alta’s public relations:

It's rarely mentioned, but the effect on bike shops is nearly catastrophic. Most bike shops rely on repairs as their most profitable source of income. And the bike share has cut into that dramatically. I'm an avid cyclist from the NW, living in NYC, and I'm surprised they're doing so poorly. It has been a long winter but regularly I ride by these stations and there isn't a bike there. How can they be losing money? Didn't the city give them the space to park? If so, how bloated is the hierarchy? I've only commented on two news stories ever. Both bike share in NYC. And previously the NY Times ran an article pre-launch about the program and tips on bike safety. The first thing in the article was a "safety tip" that had an Alta Bike safety coordinator saying, "If a taxi window is down, listen for the receipt printing because it's a clue the door may open." So I called and emailed this crew about how negligent that tip is! Was their any accountability? No! Did they ever once go onto a NYC street and listen for a receipt? If they did, they'd realize how idiotic that tip is. Borderline gross negligence. When was the last time a printing receipt harmed anyone? Never! And with all the different safety checks a cyclist must make, why would you lead a NYTimes article with a tip that doesn't work in actual practice? Because these are a bunch of college educated theorists who are afraid to get their hands dirty and understand what truly works and what doesn't. Instead they have theories and bar graphs and pie charts that include listening for printing receipts. They are lucky no one has died trying to hear a receipt only to be hit by a vehicle. And it's sad that these people stay employed. If it was the private sector they'd be broke. Instead they are in some swank office answering emails and seeing how much social media traction they have. Meanwhile, their bike wheels spin aimlessly.

For what it’s worth.

###2484||It's déjà vu all over again in the more-than-two-week search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370: Today, like yesterday, Malaysian authorities announced that another satellite detected suspected debris near the spot they believe the 777 went missing.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

We've tweaked the language at the beginning of this post to reflect this development.

It’s not clear whether the imbibing is due to joy or despair, but the latest round of punitive measures against Russia announced by President Barack Obama on Thursday packs a wallop.

The new sanctions add 20 individuals and one bank to the 11 already on a US blacklist. The people face travel bans and asset freezes. The bank will be unable to do business with any US firms or individuals.

The measures target President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, with the threat of more to come. Obama indicated he’s prepared to target key sectors of the Russian economy in retaliation for Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which Putin signed into law Friday.

“Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community,” the US president said.

The new sanctions certainly increase the tension between Moscow and Washington; it’s not yet clear whether they will do anything to move Russia out of Crimea or curb the Kremlin’s expansionist ambitions.

But the market is already reacting: Standard & Poor’s and Fitch credit rating agencies promptly downgraded the outlook for Russian sovereign debt from stable to negative, and Russian stock indexes plummeted in early trading on Friday.

Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported on Friday that Visa and MasterCard have stopped processing transactions for cardholders at certain Russian banks, including Bank Rossiya, the institution named in the US sanctions list.

Watch GlobalPost On Location video: Awaiting Russia’s next move at Ukraine’s eastern border

Moscow responded swiftly, imposing corresponding sanctions on nine US officials, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker of the House John Boehner.

The Russian measure was greeted with humor by some.

“I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off,” McCain said in a statement Thursday. “My Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.”

But Moscow isn’t laughing. Russia’s Foreign Ministry released a strongly worded statement saying that it was prepared to retaliate tit for tat.

“We have warned on numerous occasions that sanctions are a double-edged sword, and would come back like a boomerang to hit the United States,” read a statement released on the Foreign Ministry’s website. “Using this kind of language to speak with us is inappropriate and counterproductive, as those in Washington have had ample opportunity to observe.”

The United States does not do a great deal of trade with Russia — just $11 billion in exports and $27 billion in imports in 2013, which leaves Russia outside America’s top 20 list of trading partners.

Still, the portfolio of US companies with business interest there includes many of the world’s biggest corporations, which are watching the punitive actions closely. Some of them are lobbying for Washington to take a circumspect approach and avoid whacking too hard against what they consider the economic drivers that are modernizing Russia, the Financial Times reported. Until Thursday's sanctions, however, critics had been prodding the Obama administration, saying the US approach wasn't tough enough.

Europe’s economy, meanwhile, is more closely entwined with Russia’s.

Countries such as Germany and Italy are highly dependent on Russian gas, getting more 30 percent of their supply from Moscow. London banks hold vast amounts of Russian assets — up to $400 billion, according to some estimates. France has a more than $1 billion deal to sell warships to the Russian fleet.

That might explain why the EU is proceeding cautiously. At a summit meeting on Thursday, EU leaders said they would add 12 individuals to their original list of 21 Russians to be sanctioned, but as yet have released no names.

Moscow has some arrows in its quiver that are not specifically economic. It’s been cooperating with the US and allies on issues such as negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program and the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons stocks.

On Wednesday a top Russian diplomat threatened that Russia could change its stance on Iran if the standoff over Crimea continued.

Moscow and Washington are colleagues in the six-nation coalition in Vienna, known as P5+1, that’s trying to rein in Iran’s nuclear ambitions. If it so chooses, Russia could easily put roadblocks in the way. It could, for example, engage in an oil-for-goods barter deal with Tehran, undercutting the effects of US sanctions that many credit with getting Tehran to the negotiating table.

More from GlobalPost: As the Kremlin celebrates, Russia's liberals wallow

Speaking to the Interfax news agency, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was prepared to up the ante.

"We wouldn't like to take advantage of these negotiations [between the P5+1 group and Iran] as an element of gambling with a higher ante considering attitudes in some European capitals, Brussels and Washington," he said. "But if we are forced to do so, we will take retaliatory measures as well.”

Russian dissident Alexei Navalny is pressing the Obama administration to get tougher with Moscow. A candidate for Moscow mayor last fall, he garnered more than a quarter of the vote, but he’s currently under house arrest and his blog has been blocked in Russia.

On Wednesday The New York Times published an op-ed piece by Navalny advising the Obama administration on “how to punish Putin.”

Navalny recommends Washington widen its scope to target “the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation’s wealth.”

He goes on to name nine individuals. Five of those ended up on the Treasury Department’s sanctions list the next day.

The four who didn’t make the list include the heads of Russia’s oil and gas industries, and two oligarchs — businessmen who made quick fortunes in the massive grabathon that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.

While Obama has not ruled out measures against Russia’s energy sector, it would be a significant step to blacklist Igor Sechin, CEO of state oil company Rosneft, and Aleksei Miller, who runs the state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom, as Navalny suggests. The ripple effects could be severe, something that Obama acknowledged in his speech Thursday morning.

If the US was forced to target key sectors of the Russian economy, he said, “these sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy.”

As for the oligarchs: Roman Abramovich is the owner of the UK’s Chelsea Football Club, while Alisher Usmanov is the second largest shareholder in Arsenal, another popular soccer team. Trying to mess with British football hooligans might give even the leader of the free world pause.

Bennett, who took previous chief Enrique Salem's job in July 2012, vowed to streamline operations, prune midmanagement’s ranks and reframe the company around a more succinct mobility and security lineup. He apparently took the hit for Symantec’s sliding revenue, sagging share price and sluggish delivery of new products. In addition to handing over his titles, Bennett also resigned his position on the board.

As a side note, Salem now is a member of Symantec rival FireEye’s (FEYE) board of directors. FireEye is among a growing number of younger security vendors challenging Symantec’s conventional approach, aiming instead at intrusion detection and prevention.

Symantec said it has appointed a special committee of the board to collaborate with an executive search firm to find Bennett’s successor.

Board chairman Daniel Schulman said Bennett’s firing did not result from any one event or behavior but stemmed from what he termed “an ongoing deliberative process,” in which he was found lacking on product innovation and growth.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” said Schulman. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5 percent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 percent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.”

Symantec’s revenue fell 4.8 percent to $1.7 billion for the quarter ending Dec. 27. In tandem with announcing Bennett’s departure, Symantec said it expects sales in the current quarter will slide from $1.75 billion a year ago to between $1.62 billion and $1.66 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected between 29 cents and 31 cents, as compared to 27 cents in the year-ago period.

Brown, who joined Symantec's board in 2005 following the Veritas merger, said he will focus on product innovation and growth.

"With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan,” he said.

“The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market,” Brown said. "By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

On Bennett’s watch, Symantec last April rolled out Symantec 4.0, its new customer-focused sales strategy with an increased emphasis on channel partners. Under the revamped sales model, field reps are incented to work with channel partners with more resources invested in business development activities and enablement.

Justin Moore, Axcient chief executive, defended Bennett’s performance at Symantec’s helm.

“When Bennett announced his vision for Symantec 4.0, which was announced less than a year ago, he made the right choices—for the most part,” Moore said in an email. “Yet, Symantec was already too far behind the cloud/SaaS curve to catch up. A change of this magnitude is impossible in less than three to five years.”

Moore said Symantec’s problems extend beyond Bennett’s control. “Like so many other enterprise software companies, it has struggled to transition to the enterprise cloud world proving that it is indeed a systemic issue that goes far beyond Bennett's control.”###2489||Empty###2490||As Prime Minister Stephen Harper landed in the Netherlands ahead of a visit to Ukraine to meet with the country’s interim government this weekend, he announced a fresh expansion of sanctions against Russia.

Harper issued a statement Friday afternoon as he landed at The Hague announcing that Canada has imposed economic sanctions on 14 more Russian officials as well as Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based bank owned by supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Travel bans have also been imposed on the 14 individuals.

“Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty,” said Harper in the statement.

Friday’s announcement brings the total number of Ukrainian and Russian officials sanctioned by Canada to 41. The officials have been sanctioned for their connection to the invasion of Crimea nearly three weeks ago and orchestration of Sunday’s referendum that saw Crimeans vote for independence from Ukraine.

Bank Rossiya is the first financial institution to be sanctioned by Canada.

The punishments are part of Canada’s efforts to isolate Putin and his government. In addition to economic sanctions and travel bans, Canada has also broken military ties with Russia.

Along with its G7 partners, Canada has refused to recognize last weekend’s referendum in Crimea.

“The so-called referendum that was held has no legitimacy, and any additional escalations by Russia will lead to further isolation from the international community,” said Harper in the statement.

On Friday, NDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar called on the government to suspend military sales to Russia, following a similar move by Germany earlier this week. It is not known whether the Conservative government is on side with this idea.

Harper is the first G7 leader to visit the eastern European country since pro-Russian troops invaded Crimea. He will meet with Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird will also accompany the prime minister.

Following his visit to Ukraine, Harper will return to The Hague for the Nuclear Security Summit and an emergency meeting between G7 leaders. He will complete his trip with a visit to Germany, where he will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss a variety of bilateral issues.

The newly targeted individuals on Canada’s sanctions list are as follows:

– Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, Putin aide;

– Alexei Gromov, first deputy head of presidential administration;

– Sergei Ivanov, chief of staff to the presidential executive office;

– Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the Russian security council;

– Vladimir Igorevich Kozhin, Putin’s head of administration;

– Yuri Valentinovich Kovalchuk, largest single shareholder of Bank Rossiya and personal banker to senior officials;

– Sergey Yevgenyevich Naryshkin, chairman of the government Duma of the federal gathering of the Russian Federation;

– Lt.-Gen. Igor Dmitrievich Sergun, general staff chief of military intelligence

– Yury Viktorovich Ushakov, Putin foreign policy adviser;

– Vladimir Pligin, chairman of the Duma constitutional law committee;

– Arkadii Viktorovich Bakhin, first deputy defence minister;

– Mikhail Vitalevich Margelov, chairman of the federation council committee for foreign affairs;

– Vitalii Nikitich Ignatenko, first deputy chairman of the federation council committee for foreign affairs;

– Gennady Timchenko, one of the founders of the Gunvor, a major commodity trading company.

By Neil Maidment and Kate Holton

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Bruno Guillon has quit as chief executive of British luxury brand Mulberry, bringing an end to a two-year tenure marked by three profit warnings during an attempt to move upmarket that has failed to pay off.

Under Guillon, Mulberry hiked prices in an effort to become more exclusive and win back customers who were upgrading to pricier brands. But, like others in the market, it has been taken by surprise by the arrival of aspirational brands at the lower end of the luxury range, such as Michael Kors.

At the end of January, it was forced to cut profit forecasts for the third time in 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain which contributes 65 percent of sales.

“The board agreed that it was now time to part company,” a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Mulberry, which makes Bayswater and Alexa handbags that sell for up to 4,500 pounds, said Frenchman Guillon would leave immediately, without saying if he would receive any payoff.

The warning wiped over 25 percent off Mulberry’s shares in January, a loss from which they are yet to recover. Analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry’s growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

The firm’s efforts to become a global brand were also dealt a heavy blow last September when the highly-rated Emma Hill, creative director behind the Alexa and Del Rey bags, quit. Media reports suggested that Hill did not agree with the group’s strategy and she is still to be replaced.

“Given all the profit warnings at Mulberry, it was debatable how long the core shareholders would keep faith with the embattled CEO and his strategy,” analyst Nick Bubb said.

Mulberry said chairman Godfrey Davis, 64, would become executive chairman until a successor was found. During his 27 years at the group Davis has been finance chief and CEO.

Shares in the firm, which is 56 percent owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, rose 1.3 percent to 644.5p at 1028 GMT.

GROWTH STRATEGY

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to pursue more exclusive aspirations, larger rivals like Kering and LVMH, respective parents to Gucci and Louis Vuitton, have also been surprised by newcomers grabbing customers at the lower end of the market.

The likes of Michael Kors and Tory Burch, whose bags are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals, are proving increasingly popular, especially with emerging market customers - the industry’s main growth engine.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Birkin handbag maker Hermes and also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry’s share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged that value down to less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned on profits again.

On the last occasion Guillon, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, told Reuters he’d stick to his strategy. A new collection of bags was unveiled in February in collaboration with British model Cara Delevingne.

Mulberry, which still sells 60 percent of its bags for under 1,000 pounds, has focused on improving product quality and has committed to making half of its handbags in England as it seeks a higher-end position for the brand.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon “has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering” and increased the firm’s international appeal and sales overseas.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” Davis said.###2497||Image copyright AFP Image caption Mulberry shares fell more than 25% after January's profit warning

The boss of Mulberry has quit after two years in charge of the luxury handbag firm.

Bruno Guillon's departure follows a profit warning from the company in January, in which it said results would be "substantially" below expectations.

Mulberry's shares fell by more than 25% as a result and have not recovered.

Mr Guillon will be replaced on an interim basis by former boss Godfrey Davis, who oversaw rapid growth of the brand between 2002 and 2012.

Mr Davis said his predecessor had "improved the quality of the Mulberry offering", and added: "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The company issued a profits warning within months of Mr Guillon's appointment in March 2012, and in June last year announced the departure of creative director Emma Hill, who had been credited with much of the company's previous success.

Mulberry's latest profit warning earlier this year came after it said retail sales fell over the key Christmas trading period, down 7% in the eight weeks to the end of January.

It said it had experienced "significant" cancellations of wholesale orders from South Korea, and that annual profits would be about £19m, compared with analyst forecasts of £27m.

Mulberry shares rose by 1.26% in early trading on Thursday.###2498||###2499||Empty###2500||Empty###2501||Mt.

Airbnb could raise between $400 million and $500 million in a round that would value the company at $10 billion, making it among the most valuable online startups in the world, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the company's plans. If completed, the round would be the first for Airbnb since 2012 when the company raised cash on a $2.5 billion valuation.

Results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks’ financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year’s tests.

“The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago,” said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The banks’ stronger positions should enable them to pursue business plans, pay dividends to shareholders, raise capital from investors and expand services to customers, said Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment - now at 6.7 percent - would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests - even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks’ progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.

The 30 banks were also tested on how well they would withstand severe downturns in Europe and in Asian countries like China and Japan.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Nearly all U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in assets were in the group of 30 that were tested. Together they account for some $13.5 trillion in assets - about 80 percent of U.S. banks’ total amount. Twelve of the 30 banks were added to the testing roster for the first time this year.

Most of the 30 banks tested, along with hundreds of others, received federal bailouts during the financial crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.

Zions, the only bank to fall short this year, is based in Salt Lake City. It slid to a loss in the fourth quarter as it booked hefty charges related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items.

Zions said in a statement that its performance on the stress tests was worse than it expected mostly due to significantly higher commercial real estate losses, significantly greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue. The bank said that it will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Ally said it was pleased that the test results “recognized the substantial transformation that the company has undergone since last year.”

The Fed concluded last March that Wall Street powerhouses JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needed better plans for coping with a severe downturn and gave the banks until September to revise them. The two banks were allowed to increase their dividends and buy back their stock on condition they submitted revised capital plans that satisfied the Fed.

At the same time, the Fed approved requests outright from 14 of the 18 banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

But the Fed forbade Ally and BB&T; Corp. from making any dividend increases and share buybacks they may have been seeking.

Next Wednesday, the Fed will announce whether it has approved each bank’s request, if one has been made, to raise dividends for shareholders. Its decisions will be based on how each bank would fare in a severe recession if it increased its payout.

Raising dividends costs money. The government doesn’t want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.

The other banks tested were: American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Comerica Inc., Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp, M&T; Bank Corp., Northern Trust Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., Santander Holdings USA Inc., State Street Corp., U.S. Bancorp and UnionBanCal Corp.

Mixed close of markets

16.52 Europe's main stock market indices closed mixed on Thursday, with the London's FTSE 100 sliding 0.47pc to 6,542.44 points.

In Paris the CAC 40 climbed 0.46pc to 4,327.91 points, while the Dax 30 in Frankfurt added 0.21pc to 9,296.12 points.

US interest rate concerns weighing on markets

16.27 Ahead of European markets closing, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, takes a look at trading today.

UK and European markets spent most of the day bogged down in US interest rate concerns only to follow US markets higher after the Philadelphia Fed Index came in at 9 months highs with a sign that US business sentiment is improving.

The FTSE dipped briefly below the March 14 low at 6500 before recovering almost all the sessions’ losses tracking US markets higher after the positive Philly Fed and conference board data.

The Dax has been showing relative strength over the FTSE this week since tensions eased in Ukraine with a small decline yesterday and subsequent bigger percentage bounce today.

Breaking: Fitch says UK upgrade to AAA rating 'unlikely in the near term'

15.25 The UK's gold-plated credit rating isn't returning any time soon, according to Fitch

The agency says that although the economy is improving, "the UK's fiscal challenge remains large relative to most high-grade sovereigns". It adds that most of the remaining deficit reduction will be left to the next parliament, "making it somewhat less certain".

IFS questions Budget figures

14.30 Here's the bombshell graph from that IFS report - the Government's change to pension rules, allowing people to withdraw their pots instead of buying annuities, will increase borrowing in the long term rather than lowering it, as the Office for Budget Responsibility said it would yesterday.

This is because there is only a short term boost from a rush of pensioners taking their money out, which is taxable.

14.15 The IFS presentations are out (you can find them here)

A couple of slides of note: Firstly, the think tank using smileys to assess whether policy announcements add up:

Secondly, the number of taxpayers that will be dragged into paying the higher rate will climb above 5m soon:

13.30 The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the think thank, has raised questions over the OBR's sums around how much income the Treasury will receive from liberalising pensions.

The IFS's Paul Johnson said the expected higher income from pensioners drawing down taxable lump sums depend "on highly uncertain behavioural assumptions about when people take the money".

He added that allowing pensioners to access their entire pot would be potentially risky, and that those aged 60-65 tend to underestimate their own life expectancy.

New US unemployment claims rise, but point to stable jobs market

13.00 320,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, according to the US Labor Department.

This was up from 315,000 the previous week, but suggests underlying strength in the jobs market, according to economists.

The four-week mobing average, deemed a more reliable indicator, fell to 327,000, the lowest level since November.

Trader fined £662,700 for attempting to manipulate QE

12.25 A City trader has been fined £662,700 for driving the value of a government bond higher with the intention of selling it to the Bank of England as part of its quantitative easing scheme.

The Financial Conduct Authority has handed the fine to Mark Stevenson, a bond trader with over 30 years experience.

The FCA says that on October 5 2011 he deliberately raised the price of the gilt by buying into it, in the knowledge that the Bank of England would be buying bonds later that day.

Here's FCA head of enforcement Tracey McDermott's statement:

Stevenson's abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and, ultimately, for UK tax payers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions.

Odds almost even on Mulberry takeover

12.00 Mulberry's CEO Bruno Guillion is out the door this morning, and somewhat insultingly, the market likes it - shares are up 2pc as of midday.

Paddy Power has put together the odds on the company's future, and is offering 11/10 on the company being taken over by the end of the year.

Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) and Kering are Paddy Power's favourites to dip into their pockets and buy Mulberry, both at 3/1.

Mortgage lending rises 43pc in a year

11.20 With Help to Buy now due to continue until the election after next, the housing revival looks set to continue for some time. Today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show a 43.1pc rise in the value of mortgage lending between February 2013 and February 2014.

February lending of £15.2bn was the best February performance since 2008. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the data highlights the need for policymakers to keep an eye on prices:

Once strong upward momentum has developed in the housing market, it can be hard to stop – especially if interest rates are unlikely to rise markedly.

We expect house prices to increase by around 8% in 2014 with gains across the country. Furthermore, there is a genuine possibility that this could prove to be a conservative forecast particularly if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is increasingly supported by the “Help to Buy” mortgage guarantee scheme.

FTSE now falling below 6,500

10.50 The stock market remains weak, with the FTSE 100 now down 1.2pc, or some 78 points, at 6,494 after the Fed last night sparked fears about sooner-than-expected interest rate rises. Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at spread-betting firm IG, said:

Sometimes all it comes down to is a single sentence. Janet Yellen will be pondering over her performance last night, after she spooked markets with talk of an earlier-than-expected rise in US interest rates.

Although the Fed’s statement implied there would be a ‘considerable’ gap between the end of QE and the first rate hike, Yellen’s definition of considerable as ‘around six months’ wasn’t as long as some had hoped.

Barnier: Banking union will 'put end to massive bailouts'

10.00 The EU banking commissioner Michel Barnier says the agreement on banking union was reached at 7am this morning after 16 hours of negotiations.

Today's compromise allows us to complete the architecture of the banking union for the eurozone. This would not have been possible without the assiduous work and spirit of compromise demonstrated by both co-legislators

He said that banking union will create financial stability and mean banks will not require huge bailouts funded by taxpayers any more.

Together with the reforms to the financial sector for all 28 countries, the completed banking union will put an end to the era of massive bailouts. It will further contribute to the return to financial stability thus creating the right conditions for the financial sector to once again lend to the real economy which is essential to consolidate the economic recovery and to create jobs.

FTSE continues slide

09.00 The FTSE 100 is now down 44 points, or 0.7pc, at 6,528 as investors take fright at the prospect of interest rate hikes in the US. Gerard Lane, economist at Shore Capital, said:

The Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in the post-FOMC conference gave a shock to investors by suggesting that the gap between the end of QE tapering, scheduled at the end of October, and the first interest rate rise could be ‘around six months’. Given the market expectations were towards the end of 2015, for markets to consider an interest rate rise in the April 2015 resulted in sharply higher bond yields.

Osborne: More difficult decisions will be required

08.30 George Osborne has been on Radio 4 speaking about yesterday's Budget. He says policies to reduce energy bills for businesses are an attempt to put the UK on a level playing field with the rest of Europe:

We thought the European carbon trading scheme would work better than it did. The hard fact is that British businesses were going to be unable to compete with those on the continent. It will help many manufacturers who arent particularly energy intensive but do have high energy bills. We want to stay competitive create an economy where companies such as Hitachi choose to come to Britain.

More difficult decisions are required but I think we've shown we're capable of doing that. Public services have improved crime is down, we've protected the NHS budget so we've proved we've got the right approach to this. The big picture is we've got a long term economic plan that is working and brining economic security to Britain.

We don't manufacture enough, we don't export a lot, we don't save enough, we don't invest a lot and that's what future budgets are going to be about.

Stocks fall after Yellen says rates could rise next year

07.30 You may have missed it with everything else going on, but the Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen dropped a bombshell last night, suggesting that interest rates in the US could be rising as soon as 12 months from now.

The US central bank continued to slow its bond buying programme by $10bn a month to $55bn from next month, and said it could stop purchases completely in the autumn. Yellen added that the Fed could start to rise six months after that. Our US Business Editor Katherine Rushton has more here.

Refinances of residential loans that are owned or guaranteed by either Fannie Mae or Freddie totaled 138,329 during January.



It was the lowest level of refinance activity since at least 2010, the oldest date that monthly data is available for government-sponsored enterprise refinances.###2507||But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin's personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won't do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.



(Read more: Russia, West 'doomed to agree' on gas supply issues)

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations, and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes, and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)



Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPOs have been sold there. So, if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?



Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits like Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia's finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.



And then there's Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S., and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.



The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.



(Read more: Putin signs laws completing procedure to absorb Crimea into Russia)

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It's a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia's stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.



Of course, there other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign, and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it, deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That's how difficult this job is going to be.

Mulberry CEO Bruno Guillon – former managing director at Hermes in France – has resigned after two years with the brand. Mulberry’s non-executive chairman and former CEO Godfrey Davis will take over until a replacement can be found.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and he has grown international retail sales,” he said about Guillon. “I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

It was announced back in January that Mulberry’s profits were substantially low, bringing its share value down by a staggering 22%. Mulberry prices have increased significantly under Bruno Guillon as he tried to step away from “affordable luxury” and make the brand more upmarket.

Airbnb Founded: 2008 Headquarters: San Francisco Business: Lists rentals in 34,000 cities across 192 countries, charging a service fee between 6 and 12 percent for each booking. Reports indicate that the company has raised around $300 million in private investment to fund its growth. Funding: Venture capitalists have put more than $300 million into the company. : Venture capitalists have put more than $300 million into the company. -- Mike Rogoway



The financing will bring in several hundred million dollars, though the final amount hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal remains in flux. The San Francisco-based company, backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was valued at $2.5 billion in 2012.

Airbnb confirmed last week it would open a Portland outpost with 160 employees to start, and with more hires likely to follow.

At $10 billion, Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, which includes Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It would also be worth more than twice as much as publicly traded vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc.

A slew of technology startups have lately raised huge rounds of financing at increasing valuations, as corporate investors, hedge funds and mutual funds seek stakes in companies before they go public. Messaging application TangoMe Inc. today raised $280 million from investors led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in a deal that values the startup at more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this week, Cloudera Inc. said it raised $160 million, with more set to come from investors including Intel Corp., people with knowledge of the situation said.

Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb lets users rent out a couch, bedroom or house and makes money by charging a fee for each transaction. The company has listings in more than 34,000 cities, according to its website.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Airbnb’s financing. An Airbnb representative didn’t immediately have a comment. Adam Levine, TPG’s global head of public affairs, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.

###2515||Airbnb, whose chief executive is Brian Chesky, assists people in renting out their homes.

Airbnb Inc. is poised to join the 11-digit club.

The company, which was created nearly six years ago as a way to help people find spare rooms and couches to sleep on, is in advanced talks to raise more than $400 million in capital, a round of financing that would value it at more than $10 billion, people briefed on the matter said Thursday.

Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology startup firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing startups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday.

But Airbnb, a centerpiece of what has become known as “the sharing economy,” is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws, and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords, too.

Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added.

The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, may still fall apart, these people cautioned.

Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $170 billion — paid more than $16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $10 billion, while Palantir, a data analysis firm, has raised money at a $9 billion valuation.

“We’re seeing valuations go nuts,” said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.

Even so, Ellis conceded that many of the companies now in the limelight were a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits.

Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated — and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities.###2516||Carl Icahn won't give up on nagging eBay over selling PayPal (among many other things), but a new suggestion demonstrates he might be backing down -- albeit slightly.

The American business magnate published yet another open letter to eBay shareholders on Wednesday, outlining a scheme in which eBay sells off 20 percent of PayPal through an initial public offering.

As described by Icahn, the online marketplace conglomerate would then be able to keep the majority of PayPal.

Aside from the rather lengthy proposal, Icahn reiterated his disappointment (to put it lightly) in eBay's leadership:

Over the last few weeks, we have raised a number of troubling questions regarding corporate governance at eBay. Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay. Now, we have given a basic overview of the reasons we believe a 20% IPO of PayPal could be advantageous for the companies, employees and stockholders. We hope that eBay’s management is paying attention and decides to respond to this first message on the topic in a productive, transparent manner.

Icahn concluded by stressing he believes in the value of PayPal, but warned "it is on the verge of going to war against strong adversaries, and only with the benefits of being an independent company, as described above, will PayPal be capable of winning that war."

This new suggestion regarding the future of the digital payments brand is only the latest incursion between eBay and Icahn's inventment group empire.

The trouble with eBay started in January amid the company's fourth quarter earnings report. At the time, Icahn suggested (putting it mildly) that PayPal should be spun off .

Ebay didn't agree .

By the end of February , Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of the board of eBay Inc., published a pointed letter rebuffing Icahn's public criticism of eBay CEO John Donahue as well as two prominent shareholders, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Intuit founder Scott Cook.

Since then there has been a flurry of public memos and outbursts volleyed back and forth, including one by Icahn arguing that Icahn that Andreessen had too many conflicts during the Skype sale , putting up his reputation for further scrutiny.

Then last week , eBay took things to a new level in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, urging shareholders to ignore both Icahn's nominees for the board of directors while encouraging them to re-elect CEO John Donahoe and director Fred Anderson.###2517||TORONTO – Prime Minister Stephen Harper imposed economic sanctions and travel bans Friday against 14 additional Russian officials.

Harper also issued an economic sanction against Bank Rossiya, a financial institution that serves as the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation following the “so-called” referendum that annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

“Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty,” he said in a statement.

The Russian officials include Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, aide to President of the Russian Federation, Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the security council of the Russian Federation, as well as various military and foreign policy advisors.

Harper left for a trip to Ukraine Friday morning to meet with that country’s prime minister and show support for Ukrainians during the Russian incursion into the Crimean peninsula.

The brief trip to Ukraine comes a few days before Harper is expected to make the case for a tough, united G7 front against the Russians.

MOSCOW — Russia conceded today that it may scrap plans to tap international markets for money this year as it counts the cost of the sanctions imposed in the wake of the annexation of Crimea.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country absorbed Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported the move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

The sanctions are already being felt on the streets of Russia as Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin’s entourage.

Russian shares continued to falter today, and the benchmark MICEX index was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month amid growing tensions between Russia and the West.

In comments carried by Russian news agencies, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov became the first Russian official to admit to an economic fallout from the sanctions.

Siluanov said the country may scrap plans to raise $7 billion worth of bonds this year if oil and gas revenues remain steady. Moscow “may decide to give up external borrowing,” he said.

The economic sanctions ordered on Thursday by President Barack Obama targeted 20 people, including Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be his lifelong friends, and also a major Russian bank that provides them support.

Two Russian banks, including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up today to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank’s. They can also get cash directly inside their banks’ branches.

Putin has ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. As well as denying he had an account there, he ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them.”

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked for his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by the U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Fitch warned that the sanctions could weigh on Russia’s economy as it followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.

Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive. Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status.###2525||The US Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal that could have gutted regulators’ authority to impose net neutrality rules — as conflict over the issue continues elsewhere###2526||Russian stock indexes fell sharply today as investors digested the impact of US sanctions over Ukraine, including possible moves by Washington to target whole sectors of Russia’s economy.

Earlier the rouble-denominated MICEX was down 3 per cent to 1,281 points while the dollar-denominated RTS index had fallen 3.6 per cent to 1,109.

The falls came a day after US president Barack Obama said Washington was considering sanctions against key economic sectors in Russia, including financial services, oil and gas, metals and mining and the defence industry, if Russia made military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine.

EU leaders, meeting in Brussels, have said they will introduce more asset freezes and visa bans against Russian officials, and are mulling wider economic sanctions if Russia further destabilises the situation in Ukraine.

In a morning note, Promsvyazbank analyst Oleg Shagov said Mr Obama had “opened a Pandora’s box full of sanctions”, with future sanctions to be “directed against whole sectors of the Russian economy”.

The United States also introduced asset freezes and visa bans against high-ranking Russian officials and businessmen, dubbed “cronies” of president Vladimir Putin.

A St Petersburg bank linked to these businessmen, Bank Rossiya, was also sanctioned, with US officials saying that the bank would be “frozen” from the dollar. Today, Bank Rossiya said Visa and Mastercard had stopped providing services for payment transactions for the bank.

Earlier the bank said it was working “in a stable regime”. Bank Rossiya is not listed, but the sanctions against the bank - coupled with the US threat of further measures - has raised fears that similar actions could be taken against other Russian banks, echoing US measures against Iran or Syria. Investcafe analyst Grigory Birg said in a morning note that “one can expect a sharp negative reaction in the dynamics of Russian bank shares”.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, were down 2.9 per cent today, while shares in VTB were down 4.3 per cent. However the falls were broad-based, with shares in most of Russia’s blue-chips also down around 3 per cent. Gas giant Gazprom was down 2.5 per cent, oil company Lukoil down 3.2 per cent, steel company NLMK down 2.9 per cent and telecommunications company MTS down 3 per cent.

Shares in independent gas producer Novatek fell by 5.7 per cent. The company is part-owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder of Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy businessmen who has been sanctioned because of alleged links with Mr Putin.

Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from ratings agencies Fitch and S&P that they were changing their outlooks on Russia to negative from stable, because of the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy and business climate.

Both agencies presently rate Russia BBB. Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev said in response that he did not see any immediate impact from sanctions on Russia’s financial sector or creditworthiness.

In contrast to Russian shares, the rouble was stable today, having fallen steeply yesterday evening in response to the US sanctions statement, and helped by the need for Russian exporters to buy roubles to pay end of month taxes.

Reuters###2527||Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.

What: Shares of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) slumped nearly 13% Friday after the company announced the termination of CEO Steve Bennett.

So what: Bennett will be temporarily replaced by board member Michael Brown as Symantec searches for a permanent CEO. The move also follows yet another painful quarter in which Symantec saw revenue fall 5% year over year amid sluggish PC sales and a drastic sales force restructuring. Bennett insisted at the time, "While we won't be happy until total business activity is growing again, I'm happy with our financial results given the massive changes in our business."

Bennett served in his post for roughly a year-and-a-half after replacing Symantec's then-CEO of three years, Enrique Salem.

Now what: Though board chairman Daniel Schulman recognized Bennett's actions as "establishing a solid foundation for Symantec's future," he stated, "Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

So what's an investor to do? Even with shares down 23% year to date, I'm sticking by my previous stance of patiently watching from the sidelines. Symantec shares may look cheap trading below 10 times next year's expected earnings, but I have little interest diving into the stock of a faltering business until we receive more clarity on its future direction.###2528||Empty###2529||For the 24 hours to 23:00 GMT, GBP fell 0.26% against the USD and closed at 1.6596, after Ukraine remained firm on its view that the Crimea peninsula would continue to be part of its country, suggesting more friction with Russia.

Gox, once one of the biggest exchanges for the digital currency.

Version 0.9.0 of the "Bitcoin Core" software , the Bitcoin infrastructure software previously known as Bitcoin-QT, contains five separate changes designed to make so-called transaction malleability attacks harder to pull off. As Ars explained last month , the attacks work by flooding exchanges with large numbers of malformed transactions that are similar, but not identical, to legitimate transactions that have already been made. Exchanges that trust one or more of the phantom records instead of the entries in the official Bitcoin blockchain can fall out of sync with the rest of the network and must recalculate their fund balances once the mistakes become apparent.

Attacks that abused the weakness caused several exchanges to suspend cash withdrawals. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox never recovered. Three weeks ago, it filed for bankruptcy after claiming to lose $468 million, $412.5 million of which it said belonged to customers.

In version 0.9.0, the transaction malleability weakness has been fixed by tightening transaction rules preventing “mutated transactions” from being relayed or mined. It also contains new functions that report wallet transactions that conflict with each other or that contain incorrect balances for double-spent (or mutated) transactions. It also includes an installation executable that works on 64-bit versions of Windows.

"If you are running an older version, shut it down," Wednesday's release notes stated. "Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version."###2532||Mortgage Lawsuits News | Mortgage Litigation Index

FHFA MBS Settlements Surpass $10 Billion Non-agency MBS sold to Fannie and Freddie at issue March 21, 2014 By Mortgage Daily staff





The latest settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency brings to more than $10 billion the amount the regulator has collected from parties that allegedly sold faulty securities to the government-sponsored housing enterprises.



FHFA filed 18 lawsuits in 2011 against issuers and underwriters of private-label MBS that were sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007.



The lawsuits alleged that the defendants violated the Securities Act of 1933 by deceiving the secondary lenders about the quality of the MBS and the underwriting performed on the loans.

Last month CEO Mark Karpeles reported 850,000 Bitcoins missing, where Bitcoins were mysteriously moved to online wallets and then to offline wallets where they disappeared, but some has been found. Mt. Gox revealed today that they found an old online wallet that hadn't been used since 2011 and still had some change in it. The company announced in Japan that it found 200,000 Bitcoins in said wallet, which is worth just over $115 million at this morning's exchange rate.

There's still a ton missing and a lot of people lost money on the now-closed company, but it's something.

Of course, no one knows exactly what happened to all that money- was it straight theft? Why did the company keep trading long after it had knowledge of the theft? Was it outside forces or someone within?

Whatever the case stories like this don't help the new currency's reputation, especially when compounded of stories about suicides, a mysterious creator who may or may not have been finally revealed, and a rapidly fluctuating exchange rate.

According to preliminary data yesterday from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state lost 3,900 jobs during the first month of the year.

Meanwhile, the state made scant progress over the past year toward returning to the peak employment levels it reached exactly six years earlier.

In January 2008, New Jersey boasted a record 4.092 million jobs, according to data provided by Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick in Roseland.

Six years on, the Garden State is more than 167,000 jobs shy of that number, as the state reported an estimated 3.925 million jobs for January. And the 5,600 jobs the state added between January 2013 and January 2014 barely closes the gap.

"In 2013, we made less progress in the recovery than we thought," said O’Keefe, a former deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor.

According to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning think tank, the state has recovered just 37 percent of the jobs it lost during the recession. New York has recovered 163 percent and Pennsylvania 78 percent.

One area where New Jersey has made significant progress is its unemployment rate. The state’s jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent in January from 8.9 percent a year earlier. This drop puts the state closer to the national average, which stood at 6.6 percent in January and climbed to 6.7 percent in February.

But as O’Keefe noted, the drop in New Jersey’s unemployment rate had little to do with people getting jobs, but rather with people dropping out of the labor force. Yesterday’s data showed that the civilian labor force — or the count of working-age people who either have a job or are looking for one — shrank by more than 100,000 over the 12-month period ending in January.

In an interview, state Labor Department Commissioner Harold Wirths said he believed the declines in the labor force are due in part to people retiring rather than just giving up on finding work. But he acknowledged that the state, with its high taxes and heavy regulation, is lagging the nation when it comes to creating jobs.

"We definitely have a lot more work to do," he said. He expects big projects such as the Pulaski Skyway overhaul and completion of the American Dream Meadowlands in East Rutherford to create more jobs.

The January data still is subject to revisions as more complete and accurate data comes in.

"These preliminary numbers almost mean nothing," said Wirths, whose department issues the monthly jobs reports derived from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The first set of revisions occur when the state issues its February jobs report on March 27. The data also may be tweaked again when it undergoes annual "benchmarking" next year, a process meant to make it more accurate.

It was this benchmarking process that state officials gave the most attention yesterday.

Along with the January jobs numbers, the Labor Department also released benchmarked numbers for 2012 and 2013. Among other things, the data showed that the state gained more jobs last year than initially estimated, and that its persistently high unemployment rate has been mostly lower than previously reported.

The average unemployment rate in New Jersey last year was 8.2 percent, rather than 8.4 percent. Meanwhile, the average jobless rate for 2012 was revised down to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent.

Meanwhile, the state added 18,800 jobs in 2013, compared to earlier estimates that it would add just 10,100 jobs. All of the job gains were in the private sector, while the public sector shed 1,000 jobs last year. Earlier estimates saw the private sector gain just 7,300 positions last year. Also, December’s job losses, initially reported at 36,300, were revised lower to 19,100 jobs lost.

However, any boost this provided was offset by the finding that 2012 provided a smaller job haul than originally reported. Yesterday’s benchmarked data showed that the state gained just 43,900 jobs in 2012, or about a third less than the 66,400 jobs originally reported for the year.

With respect to the January and December job losses, the bitter winter did play a part, Charles Steindel, chief economist for the state Department of Treasury said in a statement, though he expects this too will abate.

"As is typically the case after such an episode, there’s a good chance the pace will pick up as the temperatures rise," he wrote.###2539||MOUNTAIN VIEW — Less than two years after taking over the helm of troubled Symantec, the world’s biggest security software company, CEO Steve Bennett was fired on Thursday in a move that stunned analysts and sent Symantec’s shares tumbling in after-hours trading.

The Mountain View company named board member Michael Brown to take over as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.

No reason was given for the termination of Bennett, who was hired to replace ousted CEO Enrique Salem in July 2012, in hopes of reviving the struggling company. Because Bennett, previously Intuit’s CEO, was widely regarded as moving the company in the right direction, his firing left some industry experts flabbergasted.

“It’s a shocker,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out. They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”

Before the announcement, Symantec’s shares rose 33 cents to $20.91 at the market’s official close. But after the company reported Bennett’s ouster, its stock price fell $1.56, more than 7 percent, in after-hours trading.

Matthew Casey, an analyst with Technology Business Research, also expressed surprise.

“It kind of caught me off guard,” he said. “I know the results of their recent quarters haven’t necessarily been the most flashy in terms of growth.” But he added that the changes Bennett was trying to bring about, which largely involved streamlining Symantec’s business, “were the correct changes that needed to be made.”

Best known for its popular Norton antivirus software, Symantec has struggled in recent years against a proliferation of other security companies, such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, in an effort to expand into the data storage business, also was widely criticized as a mistake.

In recent years, Symantec’s sales have been flat.

Last summer, Bennett cut about 1,000 jobs from Symantec’s workforce of about 20,000 and tried to find new product niches because slumping demand for personal computers had hurt its anti-virus sales. In recent months, it also has seen its chief technology offer and chief financial offer leave. But Symantec officials were vague about why Bennett was fired.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” the company said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”

The statement added that “our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

But that explanation failed to satisfy Rick Holland, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.

“This completely caught me by surprise,” he said. “I wonder what happened, for real. What’s the story that we’re not getting here?”

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

Four banks are so far affected, all of which have links to Russians blacklisted by the US.

Visa and MasterCard, both US-based companies, are forbidden from having any dealings with those targeted by the sanctions.

The banks, which said card services stopped without warning, have described the move as unlawful.

'Frozen out'

One of the banks affected, Bank Rossiya, is described by the US as Russia's 15th largest, with assets of $12bn (£7.27bn).

The St Petersburg-based bank has been singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials. US officials said it would be "frozen out" from the dollar.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bank Rossiya had nothing to do with events in Crimea and promised to transfer his wages there.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

President Putin also instructed the Russian central bank to step in, if needed, but the latter said the sanctions on Bank Rossiya did "not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability".

'Illegitimate'

Visa and Mastercard also confirmed they had stopped providing services to SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

The bank, which is Russia's 39th biggest with $5bn in assets, called the actions "illegitimate" because its owners, rather than the bank itself, were the subject of sanctions.

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

But Visa said more than 99% of its business in Russia was untouched by sanctions.

Russian shares fell sharply on Friday as investors weighed the impact of western sanctions over Ukraine.

The MICEX index, which is priced in roubles, fell as much as 3% and the RTS, which is priced in dollars fell 3.6%.

Stocks slumped after US President Barack Obama said sanctions might be extended to key parts of the Russian economy if Russia took further action in Ukraine.

Share fallsRussia's mining, defence and natural resources sectors could all be targets.

Stocks recovered some ground during the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to restore calm following the introduction of asset freezes and visa bans by the US against high ranking Russian officials.

The MICEX closed down 1% and the RTS index was down 1.3% at the end of the day.

Although only banks with connections to high-ranking Russian officials have been targeted, Russian bank shares were broadly lower.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed 1.17% lower - having fallen 2.9% earlier on Friday, while shares in VTB Bank were 2.61% lower after falling 4.3% earlier in the day.

Other sectors were also hit. Gas giant Gazprom was down 0.9%, oil firm Lukoil ended the day 1.36% higher. Russian steel company NLMK closed 1.94% lower.

Shares in gas producer Novatek closed down 9.63%. The company is part owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder in Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy Russian businessmen targeted by Western sanctions.

Negative outlook

Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch warned they were changing their outlook for the Russian economy to "negative" from "stable" - the first stage before a possible downgrade in the country's credit rating - because of the potential impact of sanctions.

Fitch said: "Since US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."

It’s business as usual at LoDo Wellness Center, one of the 54 licensed retail marijuana dispensaries in Denver. Some customers wait to order leafy buds named Sour Diesel, Dragon and Bubba Kush. Fewer just want to price or smell the merchandise.

Friendly clerks—nicknamed “bud tenders” here and elsewhere—advise, weigh, fetch and roll. Shopping happens early because closing time, citywide, is 7 p.m. for these stores.

Cannabis sales for recreational purposes turned legal Jan. 1 in Colorado, but each community decides how and whether business proceeds. Colorado Springs, one hour south of Denver, bans recreational sales. Vail is on the fence, with a moratorium until at least July 31, but a marijuana superstore proposal slowly begins clearing hurdles in Eagle, population 6,400 and 30 miles west.

Colorado’s experience with full legalization is of interest to other states—including Wisconsin—that are considering easing restrictions on the sale of recreational or medical marijuana.

Colorado’s approach to business is far from uniform and not every issue has been addressed. For example, potency of commercially manufactured “edibles”—foods and beverages infused with THC—doesn’t match product labels, according to lab analyses commissioned by The Denver Post .

Entrepreneurs smell opportunity and confront roadblocks, particularly in opening members-only social clubs for pot smoking.

Dispensaries have multiple personalities. The reception area at LoDo Wellness looks like a homey living room, good for lounging, with a window view of pot plants growing under greenhouse lights. In contrast, the narrowness of Good Chemistry, near Colorado’s State Capitol, provides little room or opportunity for gawking. Healing House, near the University of Denver, displays merchandise like fine jewelry, stretched beneath glass countertops. The 3D Cannabis Center, a warehouse not far from Denver Coliseum, was closed on a weekday afternoon, without explanation.

Tourism offices, for now, take a hands-off approach to pot tourism. That means no comprehensive guides (or vetting process) for pot-friendly lodging, tours or nightlife.

One thing is certain: Colorado collected about $2 million in taxes from $14 million in recreational pot sales during January, and optimists say it’s the birth of a billion-dollar industry.

“In progressive precincts, pot is becoming a fixture of polite society,” asserts party planner Jane West of Denver’s Edible Events during a recent interview with TV journalist Harry Smith. “We’re changing the face of what a cannabis consumer looks like.”

Here are a few things mile-high travelers will want to know.

How will I know where pot is being sold?

Consult weedmaps.com, which shows sales outlets throughout the U.S. Only Colorado allows shops for recreational use. That changes this spring, when rec shops open in the state of Washington.

How can I compare prices and get the word on quality?

Check ads and product reviews in alternative weekly newspapers: Westword (westword.com) in Denver, the Boulder Weekly (boulderweekly.com) and Colorado Springs Independent (csindy.com). The Denver Post ’s marijuana editor manages thecannabist.com.

Can you buy it in Colorado cafés, as is done in Amsterdam?

No. Only licensed dispensaries sell cannabis products legally, but you can’t light up or snack on edibles there. Similarly, you can’t buy a pot-infused dessert at a restaurant, but sometimes events invite attendees to BYOC (Bring Your Own Cannabis). Edible Events organizes high-end functions.

Must I be a Colorado resident?

No, but how much you can purchase for recreational purposes is dictated by residency. A Colorado resident can buy one ounce. A non-resident’s limit is one-fourth of an ounce.

Sales typically are for one-eighth ounce. Prices are all over the place, depending upon the strain, and can be twice as expensive for rec users vs. medical patients. Ads for a $15 eighth are likely not for tourists.

We saw joints priced at $8 to $15, and online averages of $40 or $45 for an eighth.

Do I need a prescription to buy?

No, but you must be at least 21 and flash a government-issued photo I.D. to get into rec dispensaries.

Forget about seeing a medically licensed dispensary unless you can slide a state-issued “red card”—medical marijuana card—through a security window.

When a dispensary is licensed both ways, you’ll only shop in the rec area. Medical patients may possess two ounces of pot—or more, depending on what their docs recommend—and purchases aren’t taxed as high. Being a medical marijuana patient also is the only way for those under 21 to legally buy pot products. Approved conditions for medical marijuana use include cancer, glaucoma, HIV or a chronic/debilitating condition with severe pain, nausea, spasms or seizures.

Must I use cash?

It depends upon the dispensary. Ask before shopping. Some have an ATM.

Where can I smoke?

Not in public view. Not while driving. Not on ski slopes. Not in most hotel rooms; state law says at least 75% per property must be smoke-free. Some hotels are entirely smoke-free, so check before making assumptions.

Some music venues, like Quixote’s True Blue in Denver, have a concealed outdoor patio for smoking. Good for Deadheads.

I don’t smoke, so what kind of pot-infused alternatives can I enjoy?

Packaged brownies, chocolate-dipped pretzels, hard candy, gummies, spiked punches—you name it. The range of products depends upon the dispensary, and it pays to compare prices, but few tip their hand online.

Product potency might be lots higher than you’d expect, especially if you haven’t indulged for decades.

Edibles with 100 mg of THC seem typical, and bud tenders advise starting with one-fourth of whatever you buy, then waiting at least 30 minutes before deciding whether to nibble more.

A single Love’s Oven oatmeal cookie with 100 mg of THC cost $25 (plus tax) at The Healing House, and the same potency in Dr. J’s Flying Aces hard candy cost $18. Good Chemistry’s thumb-wide chocolate-caramel cups from Mountain Medicine sell for $10.

How will I know if what I’m buying is any good?

Talk frankly to a “bud tender”—dispensary sales staffer—about how you define “good.” Much depends upon expectations, and bud tenders should be knowledgeable about their strains of products and effects.

If you don’t feel comfortable with the answers, find another dispensary. There’s no obligation to buy.

Are there any consumer protections? Or regulations?

This isn’t dark-alley dealing—a sales license is required. Although it’s OK to share small amounts of stash if no money is exchanged, personal sales of marijuana remain illegal.

Whatever is bought from a dispensary is labeled with great detail. Each product can be traced back to a specific grower and plant.

To complain, contact the confidential tip line of Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division at 855-277-7500 or file online with the state’s Consumer Protection Section (coloradoattorneygeneral.gov).

How are police dealing with stoned drivers? Is it a problem?

It is illegal to drive under the influence. You can get a DUI with a minimum of five nanograms (five billionths of a gram) of THC per milliliter of blood. That’s “just a few hits off a joint,” concludes weedmaps.com.

A $1 million television ad campaign, to remind people not drive stoned, began this month after Colorado State Patrol reported 31 of 61 impaired motorists in January were detained because of marijuana.

“Drive high, get a DUI” is the slogan, and ads use humor to make their point.

Can I drive to Colorado, load up my car with pot, and leave?

We have no evidence of border patrols, but transporting cannabis or products containing it across state lines is illegal. As a federal offense, maximum punishment is one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Depending on your route home, penalties could be more severe: Get nabbed in Nebraska with more than one pound, for example, and max consequences are five years and $10,000.

The IRS inspector general says thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million. As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer.

Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.

J. Russell George is the IRS inspector general. He said Thursday that real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail. He says real agents don’t demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

He says people have been targeted in nearly every state.###2546||NEW YORK – Wal-Mart has unveiled an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. Other retailers offer to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Wendy’s beginning mobile pay option

NEW YORK – Wendy’s is rolling out a program that lets customers pay using their smartphones, following similar plans unveiled by Burger King earlier this week.

The Wendy’s Co., based in Dublin, Ohio, has been testing the mobile payment option over the past year and said the majority of its roughly 5,800 U.S. locations are now ready to accept the payments.

The move reflects a push by fast-food chains to court younger customers by tapping into the attachment they have to their phones.

Burger King Worldwide Inc. said this week it would introduce a mobile payment program at its U.S. restaurants in April.

Shrimp costs putting hurt on Red Lobster

ORLANDO, Fla. – A spike in shrimp costs is causing trouble for Red Lobster.

Parent company Darden has been fighting for some time to win back customers at its Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains as more affordable alternatives such as Chipotle have gained in popularity.

But in recent months, higher shrimp costs have become another factor weighing on Red Lobster. Chief Financial Officer Brad Richmond says the company is facing a $30 million increase in shrimp costs on an annual basis.

The Orlando-based company on Friday reported a lower quarterly profit due to weak sales at its Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains.

Darden has said it will spin off or sell Red Lobster to focus its attention on fixing Olive Garden.

Families sue GM over faulty ignition switch

DETROIT – The families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 Wisconsin car crash are suing General Motors, alleging that the company was negligent in designing its small cars and committed fraud by not disclosing facts about the defects.

Natasha Weigel, who was 18, and Amy Rademaker, who was 15, died after the October 2006 crash involving a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt compact car with a faulty ignition switch. The car’s driver, Megan Phillips, suffered permanent brain damage, according to a statement from the families’ law firm.

GM failed to warn the teens of a dangerous defect and misrepresented the car’s safety, said lawyer Robert Hilliard in a statement. The firm said the lawsuit was filed Friday in Hennepin County, Minn., where the car was purchased.

The crash was among the first blamed on the faulty ignition switches. Last month GM recalled 1.6 million Cobalts and other small cars worldwide to replace the switches. The company has admitted knowing about the problem for at least 11 years before taking the action.###2547||Empty###2548||Silicon Republic Cookies Policy

Despite the orgy ordeal that forced a comedian to vacate his Chelsea apartment, Airbnb is in talks raise money that would value the apartment rental service at an eye-popping $10 billion.

Airbnb, which counts actor Ashton Kutcher as an early backer, is in talks to raise between $400 million and $500 million from a group of investors that will likely be led by private-equity firm TPG, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Post.

At the $10 billion valuation, the San Francisco startup would be worth more than established hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide, valued at $8.45 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.

The talks are in the advanced stages, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.

Before this latest funding round, Airbnb was valued at $2.5 billion based on $326 million from financial backers, including venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Founder’s Fund.

Kutcher, Demi Moore’s ex, was named an Airbnb “strategic adviser“ after he invested in the venture in 2011.

Earlier this week, Airbnb found itself in a hot mess when Ari Teman discovered that his apartment, which had he had listed on Airbnb, had hosted a wild sex party advertised on Twitter as a “XXX FREAK FEST.”

Teman thought he was renting the pad to someone who was going to use it to host some wedding guests.

Airbnb has since put Teman up in a hotel and banned the party planner from its website. It is also discussing reimbursing him for the damage to his home.

“Airbnb has been responsive, and we are still in talks,” Teman told The Post about the bizarre episode, which he said left his furniture unusable and his clothes mysteriously damp.

Aside from the raunchy party, Airbnb is being probed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over a state law that forbids people from renting their homes for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is also present.

The AG is also concerned that some Airbnb hosts are avoiding a 14.75 percent state occupancy tax.

Schneiderman has asked for data on as many as 225,000 New Yorkers who have rented out rooms through Airbnb since 2010. The company has been fighting the data request, arguing it invades its users’ privacy.###2551||You are the owner of this article.###2552||British luxury company Mulberry Group has revealed that Bruno Guillon is to step down as CEO with immediate effect.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Guillon, who has been in the role for just two years, joined the business from French luxury brand Hermès where he was managing director of its French division.

While he has been credited with helping Mulberry to increase its international appeal and grow international retail sales, his departure comes after the company earlier this year issued a profit warning on tough UK trading at Christmas and order cancellations in South Korea.

The group's total retail sales were down 3% in the 17 weeks to 25 January, and down 7% for the last eight weeks of that period.

The company was also rocked by departure of its creative director Emma Hill last year amid reports of disagreements over company strategy. Hill was largely responsible for leading the resurgence of Mulberry in recent years.###
