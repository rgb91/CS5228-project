But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge.
But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe.###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.
GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.###5218||Starting March 26, Walmart will start accepting used games for Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles at more than 3,100 U.S. Walmart locations.

In her view, the relatively low volatility since the start of 2014 coupled “with the hope that the US data weakness is temporary has brought the EURUSD up, almost to the projected level (1.3967)”.
The weakness of US data over the winter months has been partly weather-affected, “but to which extent, we will only find out in April/May”, notes the FX strategist.

In her view, the relatively low volatility since the start of 2014 coupled “with the hope that the US data weakness is temporary has brought the EURUSD up, almost to the projected level (1.3967)”.
The weakness of US data over the winter months has been partly weather-affected, “but to which extent, we will only find out in April/May”, notes the FX strategist.

The company’s shares are feeling the heat today – down around 13% at time of writing.
At the same time, Symantec reiterated its fourth quarter revenue and profit guidance: it expects revenue of between $1.62bn and $1.66bn (versus $1.75bn the previous year).
So it’s no surprise that competition is fierce among both existing players and relatively new entrants as they grapple to gain a larger share of the growing security market.
Following underperformance, and in a bid to reposition competitively, Symantec embarked on a transformation plan, which included developing new competitive products and cutting costs.###5807||The domain woi-tv.com maybe for sale.

The escort change was for administrative reasons: The Stout is assigned to the U.S. European Command area, and the Elrod is assigned to U.S. Africa Command, Warren said.
About 25 members of the Stout's crew who had been aboard the Morning Glory to provide security, navigation and communications assistance have been replaced by about 34 sailors from the Elrod, according to Warren.
The Elrod and Morning Glory are expected to reach international waters just outside Libya this weekend, where the Morning Glory will be turned over to Libyan authorities, Warren said.

Nordea Markets FX strategist Aurelija Augulyte believes that, contrary to common understanding, the best chance for the US dollar to strengthen against the euro is if the US economic data should continue to surprise to the downside.
In her view, the relatively low volatility since the start of 2014 coupled “with the hope that the US data weakness is temporary has brought the EURUSD up, almost to the projected level (1.3967)”.
The weakness of US data over the winter months has been partly weather-affected, “but to which extent, we will only find out in April/May”, notes the FX strategist.

TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, said a lot of ipeople bought Symantec because it had a new CEO and was involved in online security.
Pointing to FireEye (FEYE), Cramer said that a stock can do very well in this industry when it delivers but when it offered 14 million shares in a secondary offering, FireEye shares suffered.
Cramer admitted he "fears" that when the insiders in Symantec start selling their shares, the stock will suffer.
"Insider selling is what wrecked 2000," Cramer concluded, and it can wreck these companies, too.###5966||Empty###5967||Empty###5968||Empty###5969||Empty###5970||###5971||You are using an older browser version.

It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue.
They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores.
Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides.

From the Associated Press:The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.
The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker’s disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.
“Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues … Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress,” Holder told a news conference.
