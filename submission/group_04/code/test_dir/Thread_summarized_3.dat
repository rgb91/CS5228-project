1915||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake.
The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.
The first coin to embed banknote-like securityAlthough it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.
EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded.
Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.
The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1917||Why did this happen?

Kellogg's is a pure-play food company with a 100-year plus legacy of maintaining integrity in the way it operates its business, serves its customers, and creates value for investors.
Kellogg's uses palm oil in its snack food products and came under scrutiny over its joint venture with Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil trader with a high-profile track record of controversial environmental practices.
Lucia von Reusner, Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management, confirmed via email that "By raising the bar, Kellogg's palm oil commitment should encourage other companies to step up and support the development of transparent and responsible palm oil supply chains."
With 2013 sales of $14.8 billion and more than 1,600 food products it's little wonder that besides General Mills (GIS), Kellogg's is one of the most popular food stocks among investors.###2026||Search for missing Malaysia Airlines jet: As it happened on Sunday"The search area experienced early sea fog particularly in the western areas, however, conditions improved during the day," it said.

Rather than stroke checks to insurers to make up for the huge sums they’ll lose by participating in Obamacare’s exchanges, Congress should scrap the law altogether.
Here’s how the risk corridors work.
Because estimates of Obamacare’s cost have marched steadily upward since the law passed, though, that outcome seems unlikely.

Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule.
By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it.###2171||Empty###2172||FTSE CLOSE: Stocks fall as US interest rate rise is planned for next year; betting and retirement firms struggle post-Budget17.30 (CLOSE): Blue-chip shares have fallen after US Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen warned that US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.
