The move will take effect on March 17, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement, and follows years of international pressure on Beijing to allow faster yuan appreciation.
The change, which follows Beijing's landmark move in April 2012 to double the trading band to 1.0 per cent, is seen by some analysts as a key step towards establishing a market-based exchange-rate system.
It added that the bank "will further develop the role of the market in the RMB exchange rate formulation mechanism".

It did not update its estimates for U.S. and Japanese growth in the second quarter because one-off factors made it too problematic, it said.Turning to Europe, the OECD saw Germany's quarter-on-quarter annualized growth rate reaching 3.7 percent in the first quarter before slowing to 2.5 percent.France, the euro zone's second biggest economy after Germany, was seen growing only 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year, rising to 1 percent in the second quarter.Outside the euro zone, the British economy was seen growing 3.3 percent in both the first and second quarters.Turning to emerging market economies, the OECD said some were seeing a marked loss of momentum as capital outflows exposed vulnerabilities in some countries.It noted that Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey among others have been forced to raise interest rates to keep capital outflows in check.Meanwhile, weak balance sheets in China raised the risk of a sharp slowdown there, the OECD said.###4259||Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia on Thursday denied a media report that its missing airliner flew on for hours after last making contact, and said Chinese photos that raised hopes of a search breakthrough actually showed no wreckage.

As my colleague Jeffrey Brown has pointed out, "Citi Research [an arm of Citigroup] puts the decline rate for existing U.S. natural gas production at about 24%/year, which would require the industry to replace about 100% of current U.S. natural gas production in four years, just to maintain current production."

The Fed's most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows "well past" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent.
One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health.
