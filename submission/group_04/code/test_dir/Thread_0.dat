1||ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

"So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

"Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well," he said.

(NYSE:HLF) halted trading to reveal that the Federal Trade Commission was launching an investigation into its business practices. That sent shares into a downward spiral, as they declined by as much as 9% in the wake of that announcement.

Activist investor Bill Ackman is probably smiling right about now, although his firm Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the FTC investigation.

Bill Ackman’s bet starts to turn around

Ackman famously announced he had a $1 billion short position in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in late 2012. Since then, he has been trying to discredit the company, calling it a pyramid scheme and targeting some of those who are connected with it. This week he gave another presentation, this time focusing on the company’s China operations and showing how he believes the company operates outside Chinese regulations governing direct sales. He remains convinced that regulators will investigate and shut Herbalife down as a pyramid scheme.

Business Insider reports that with today’s decline in Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s share price, Ackman has now earned back about $72 million on his bet against the company. Of course estimates have been changing over the last year or so, but the most recent estimate suggested he lost about $500 million on paper. So he’s still got a ways to go before he breaks even on his short bet.

Ackman did reposition his firm’s short position on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in October. He had been shorting approximately 20 million of the company’s shares, but then he swapped about 40% of his position for put options. According to Business Insider’s estimates, that means he still has about 12 million shares of Herbalife shorted. With today’s decline, that’s about a $72 million paper profit on that short. However, some of that turnaround could be erased as shares continue to ping pong on news of the FTC investigation.

Other MLM stocks affected by Herbalife news

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) shares aren’t the only ones affected by today’s news. Shares of competing multi-level marketing company Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted shortly after Herbalife’s shares because of extreme volatility. Shares of Nu Skin rose as much as 5% after the FTC probe was announced, as investors may be thinking Nu Skin will benefit from Herbalife’s problem.

Shares of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:USNA), another multi-level marketing company which sells nutritional supplements, declined as much as 6% after the probe was announced.###4||Why did this happen?

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777�s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.###6||Empty###7||Stock Market Headlines:

“Underwriting standards at present of mortgage providers are quite high...,” said Carney in remarks to a committee of lawmakers.

“Our concern is that those underwriting standards will deteriorate and that that deterioration itself would be fed by general improvement in the housing market.”

Britain’s recovery to date has been driven by household spending and a revival in the property market. Mortgage approvals in January hit their highest since November 2007.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28.

The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.

Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.

On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.

Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.

The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.

News of the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology worried investors last week.

The loss-making solar cell and panel producer announced Wednesday that it would not be able to pay the interest on a loan. The interest payment of 89.8 million yuan was due on Friday.

The company became the first domestic company in the corporate bond market to default. It was seen as an indicator that more similar defaults may follow.

Despite the potential boost for stock markets from policy announcements at the ongoing annual two sessions - the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - investors remained cautious last week.

The Bank of England has announced three new appointments: among the new names is Dr Nemat Shafik ('Minouche' to her friends), who as the Bank’s new deputy governor for markets and banking, will become only the fifth woman to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee since it was formed in 1997 – and the first in four years.



The other two appointments (male, natch) are former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser Ben Broadbent, who will replace current deputy governor for monetary policy when Charlie Bean steps down at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank. Whitbread chairman Anthony Habgood will oversee the court of the Bank of England.



George Osborne, who is in charge of appointments to the Bank of England, has been criticised for picking people he ’plays golf with’ to join the Bank. No word on whether Shafik, who is currently deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, ever frequents the fairway – but it’s an encouraging step forward for the all-white, all-male MPC.

This isn't the last we'll hear of the new, improved Bank of England: on Wednesday evening governor Mark Carney will announce a 'radical shake-up' of the way it functions. He's already said he wants to break down the 'silos' and create 'one bank'.

Shafik said this morning she's excited about the chance to 'reshape the Bank's balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank's operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world'.

She follows in some illustrioius female footsteps: the former ladies of the MPC have included an CBI economic adviser and a Shell chief economist...

1. Kate Barker CBE (2001-2010)

Previously: Chief economic adviser at the CBI. During her time on the MPC she led two major policy reviews for government, one on housing supply and one on land use planning.

Now: Senior adviser to Credit Suisse, non-executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s oversight board, non-exec director of Electra Private Equity, Taylor Wimpey and Yorkshire Building Society.

2. Marian Bell CBE (2002-2005)

Previously: Set up and ran research function of RBS’s treasury and capital markets division, worked at the Treasury

Now: Member of the Fiscal Policy Panel of the States of Jersey, economics consultant, member of Zurich Insurance’s International Advisory Council.

3. DeAnne Julius (1997-2001)

Previously: Chief economist at British Airways and Shell, senior economic advisor at the World Bank, consultant to the IMF.

Now: Director at Jones Lang LaSalle, non-exec director at Deloitte.

4. Rachel Lomax (2003-2008)

Previously: Permanent secretary of three departments (the Department of Work and Pensions, the Welsh Office and the Department for Transport), vice president and chief of staff at the World Bank, head of economic and domestic secretariat at the Cabinet Office

Now: Non-exec director at HSBC###18||Empty###19||J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.###20||Why did this happen?

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one of the pilots and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government announced findings that strongly suggested the plane was deliberately diverted and may have flown as far north as Central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communications systems — the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS — about 40 minutes after takeoff. The ACARS equipment sends information about the jet’s engines and other data to the airline.

Around 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems was also shut down. The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane’s disappearance was deliberate.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang told reporters he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air traffic controllers.

Given the expanse of land and water that might need to be searched, finding the wreckage could take months or longer. Or it might never be located. Establishing what happened with any degree of certainty will probably require evidence from cockpit voice recordings and the plane’s flight-data recorders.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

"The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort," he said. "It has now become even more difficult."

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane’s final movements.

With more information, he said, the search zone could be narrowed "to an area that is more feasible."

Malaysia is leading the search for the plane and the investigation into its disappearance.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC’s "Meet the Press" that the FBI was supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC’s "This Week" that so far "there’s nothing out there indicating it’s terrorists."

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Malaysia’s police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said he asked countries with citizens on board the plane to investigate their backgrounds, no doubt looking for anyone with terrorism ties, aviation skills or prior contact with the pilots. He said that the intelligence agencies of some countries had already done so and found nothing suspicious, but he was waiting for others to respond.

Police searched the homes of both pilots Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities "didn’t see the necessity in the early stages."

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Zaharie, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories. Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said the simulator was not in itself cause for any suspicion.

Malaysian police were also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last "ping" was sent out at 8:11 a.m. — 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia or far into the southern Indian Ocean.

Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to "ping" when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Australia said it was sending one of its two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search to remote islands in the Indian Ocean at Malaysia’s request. The plane will search the north and west of the Cocos Islands, a remote Australian territory with an airstrip about 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) southwest of Indonesia, military chief Gen. David Hurley said.

Given that a northern route would have sent the plane over countries with busy airspace, most experts say the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. The southern Indian Ocean is the world’s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

Whoever disabled the plane’s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.

Chong said that he last saw Zaharie a week before the pilot left on the flight for Beijing and that they had agreed to meet on his return to organize a shopping trip for poor children.

"If I am on a flight, I would choose Captain Zaharie," he said. "He is dedicated to his job. He is a professional and he loves flying."###23||Why did this happen?

As with the C 63 sedan, a new 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 is likely to be central to the new C 63 wagon, replacing the 336kW/600Nm atmo 6.2-litre V8 currently in use in both outgoing models.

Expected to be 350kW/650Nm-plus, the new C 63’s engine outputs will better those of the next-generation 317kW/550Nm six-cylinder BMW M3, which is the C-Class AMG’s chief rival, but not the twin-turbo 5.5-litre E 63 AMG’s 430kW/800Nm.

However, Mercedes-AMG has confirmed that unlike the latest E 63, CLS 63 and S 63, the next C 63 will remain exclusively rear-wheel drive. Whatever the final performance outputs and acceleration figures, the outcome will undoubtedly be a spectacularly fast – yet cleaner and more economical – sports estate.

The AMG C-Class estate will naturally embrace the suspension, quad exhaust, wheels and aero aids of the sedan, and will add the usual roof spoiler at the top of the tailgate.

Crude prices edged lower on Tuesday, as soft Chinese trade data continued to spook investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling while concerns that U.S. weekly inventory data may disappoint also watered down prices. Crude dips on Chinese trade data, U.S. stockpile concerns Weak Chinese trade continued to bruise oil prices on Tuesday. Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world's second-largest consumer of crude oil. The numbers also sparked concerns that U.S. demand for Chinese-made goods may have taken a hit due to a string of harsh winter storms, which may reflect in Wednesday's supply data as well as Thursday's data on U.S. retail sales.

CANBERRA, March 11 AAP - Sub-par economic performances by several emerging markets will likely be a restraint on the global economy in the near term, the OECD says.

In an update of its November economic outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says major advanced economies are continuing to strengthen, helped by low interest rates and reduced drag from their budgets.

However, it said in an Interim Economic Assessment released in Paris on Tuesday that for major emerging market economies (EMEs) it is more of a mixed picture, with some experiencing a marked loss of momentum.

"Given that emerging economies now account for over half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major EMEs is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term," the OECD said.

The decision last December by US Federal Reserve to begin winding back its asset-buying stimulus program, otherwise know as tapering, forced a number of emerging market central banks to lift interest rates to stem capital outflows.

The OECD believes this gradual scaling down of stimulus by the US Fed was the right decision with the recovery in the world's largest economy relatively well established.

But it also highlighted the vulnerabilities of some emerging economies to swings in capital flows and currency pressures.

"In a few cases it may be possible to ease fiscal policy to offset the contractionary effect of tighter monetary policy, but some EMEs are constrained by the need to reduce budget deficits," it said.

As for Australia's number one trading partner, China, the OECD says growth is around trend and inflation is well contained.

However, it believes China needs to restrain credit growth to help address the growing vulnerability of its financial system.

More broadly, the OECD said some long-standing risks remain for the outlook.

"Japan is only just beginning to confront its daunting fiscal challenges, fragilities in the euro area are still acute, and the possibility persists of a sharp slowdown in China driven by balance sheet effects," it says.###35||Filomena Scalise

Sydney - Asian markets were finding their feet on Tuesday after a rocky ride the previous session, though uncertainty about the true state of China's economy kept the mood brittle and commodity prices depressed. Most regional shares edged higher, led by Japan's Nikkei which advanced 0.8 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday.

Shanghai, however, lost another 0.2 percent to be perilously close to it lowest since last July and prices for industrial commodities stayed under water in the wake of February's shock fall in Chinese exports.

Dealers were especially nervous about iron ore following an 8 percent slide on Monday that fuelled unease about the health of China's giant steel sector.

Brent crude lost a further 13 cents to $107.95, while US oil extended its decline to $101.03 a barrel.

There was some relief that rates in Chinese money markets were not showing much strain while the yuan was fixed in line with expectations.

Wall Street also managed to end steady on Monday after recouping early losses. The Dow Jones industrial average ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P 500 lost just 0.05 percent.

Other popular indicators of risk were also muted. The stock market's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended little changed after an early spike, while US 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent.

Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the US dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies.

Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, stabilised at $0.9030 after losing half a US cent on Monday.

The euro held rock steady at $1.3875, while the dollar inched up to 103.33 yen.

Later on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is expected to reaffirm its commitment to massive monetary stimulus. Nothing new is expected at the policy meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April.

The Japanese economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent annualised pace in the last quarter of 2013 as net exports proved a major drag, intensifying pressure for fresh action form the central bank.

The BOJ's decision is due anytime after 03h00 GMT, and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference afterward.

Gold was a shade firmer at $1,340.61 an ounce on Tuesday as fears of an economic slowdown in China and Ukraine's geopolitical crisis keep investors seeking safe-haven bullion.

In a sign of investor confidence in the precious metal amid global uncertainties, the world's biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday. - Reuters###36||The European Central Bank's stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone's largest banks when it details tomorrow how it will test balance sheets.

This is according to three sources with knowledge of the tests, Reuters have reported.

The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets.

Estimates of the capital shortfall range from €280 billion to as much as €770 billion.

The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.

As well as the initial review on whether banks' assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises.

A document detailing the tests' methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches.

"It will terrify them, even though they've got a reasonable idea of what's coming," one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages.

The ECB declined to comment.

The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in the announcement would be the ECB's view of when loans become impaired, and the way 'hard to value assets' are treated.

For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said.

A third source said that while the ECB's decision on impairment triggers was "reasonable" some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB's list of definitions of indicators for impairment.

Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen. "Triggers can be subjective," the second source said.

If a loan's status is changed from performing to non-performing, it would have a higher probability of default, some thing that would force a bank to set aside more capital to provide for higher likely losses.

Banks' estimates on loan losses will be pitted against 'challenger models' created by external auditors - carrying out the tests on behalf of supervisors - an approach first tried in Ireland's balance sheet assessment in late 2013, two of the sources said.

Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones.

The rules also require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said.

The ECB has taken care to prevent any leaks. Recipients of details of the review face fines of €100,000 for leaks and copies have been water-marked with the name of its owner, the sources said.###37||Empty###38||Empty###39||Empty###40||* U.S. Senate announces its own probe of GM, NHTSA over recall

* Senate, House say criminal investigation could complicate their probes

* Faulty ignition switches linked to 12 deaths

* Hit to GM stock “overdone” -analyst

By Ben Klayman, Richard Cowan and Eric Beech

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Wednesday that even after the vehicles in its ignition-switch recall are repaired, owners should avoid weighing down their key rings with anything more than the key and fob.

Also on Wednesday, U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said a Senate subcommittee plans to hold a hearing in early April on GM’s recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles with the faulty ignition switches which have been linked to 12 deaths. Most of the affected cars were sold in the United States.

GM became aware of the problem a decade ago.

“We have to get to the bottom of this,” said McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. “We need to find out who dropped ball and put millions of Americans at risk.”

GM has been telling owners affected by the recall that until the repairs are made only the key should be on the key ring. That remains largely the case after the fix as well, according to a document filed with U.S. safety regulators.

“We recommend that customers only utilize the key, key ring and key fob (if equipped) that came with the vehicle,” GM said in the document filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That was in response to a question about whether customers can put their heavy key ring back on after the repair is completed.

A GM spokesman said after the repair is completed, there is no danger of the problem reoccurring. Asked why GM made this recommendation, he added that no ignition switch is safe from being moved from the “run” position if the key chains are too heavy or bulky.

Automotive research firm Edmunds.com said while there is anecdotal evidence owners should avoid too much weight on their key rings, there is no industry standard language on that subject.

The Detroit automaker also said in the filing that it will offer loaner cars in some cases and a $500 cash allowance to unhappy owners affected by the recall.

The problems in the affected vehicles in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. GM previously had said there were 13 deaths linked to the faulty ignition switch, but revised that to 12 on Tuesday because it had double-counted one incident.

The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the “run” position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.

GM said in the NHTSA document on Wednesday that it is providing rental or loaner vehicles in some cases.

The company also said it is not buying back affected vehicles if owners ask for that, but is offering a $500 special cash allowance, through April 30, to buy a 2013, 2014 or 2015 model-year vehicle.

On Tuesday, a source said federal prosecutors have opened a probe of GM, examining whether the company is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that led to the recall.

PARALLEL PROBES

The New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in the probe, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.

The federal probe by the FBI and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. NHTSA previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.

McCaskill said the Senate Commerce Committee’s consumer protection subcommittee will examine the responses of GM and NHTSA to the discovery of faulty ignition switches. She told Reuters that the congressional probe is “more challenging” now that the Justice Department also has opened its own investigation.

“While we would like to get as much information as possible and have General Motors as witnesses,” McCaskill said her panel’s review is “really about how NHTSA has handled this and what are the challenges that NHTSA faces in being an effective cop on the beat.”

She said she has concerns about whether NHTSA had insufficient expertise and also about a lack of transparency at the agency. She did not know which GM executives would be called to testify.

Safety advocates have criticized NHTSA for failing to catch the GM issue and failing to demand a recall despite tracking the problems at different points over the past decade.

Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said NHTSA’s lack of action suggests the agency’s own review process may be ineffective despite changes made after the high-profile Ford-Firestone tire recall in 2000.

However, NHTSA’s chief said U.S. auto-safety regulators did not force GM to recall the cars sooner because the connection between defective ignition switches and failing airbags was not clear.

“If we had that information, if GM had provided us with timely information, we would have been able to take a different course with this,” David Friedman, acting administrator for NHTSA, told Bloomberg on Wednesday in Washington.

Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters in Washington on Wednesday that he had a “high level of confidence” in NHTSA, “but we’ll continue watching as facts unfold and see where we are.”

Foxx said his department is having a “dialogue” with the U.S. Department of Justice about the GM recall. “They’re looking at the same information we’re looking at. They will make that determination.”

The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also has ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about the automaker’s ignition-switch problems. A House committee aide said on Wednesday that while the Justice probe may complicate what information can be received, the committee expects NHTSA and GM to comply with information requests.

GM has declined to comment on news of the criminal probe, but has said it is cooperating on all the various probes.

“We are fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Congress, too,” GM spokesman Greg Martin said in an email on Wednesday. “We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts.”

The automaker is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter.

GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from NHTSA, and several analysts have estimated the recall could cost the company $70 million to $280 million.

The automaker has not disclosed what the recall will cost. Analysts agreed that the biggest costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.

Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note that Tuesday’s 5 percent stock decline was “overdone” as the $3.2 billion hit to the company’s market cap was likely well above any potential settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ lawyers.

However, Johnson added that it was unclear what might make the stock rise in coming months as continued media headlines were likely to weigh heavily on GM shares.

NEW YORK — The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into the decadelong failure by General Motors to address deadly safety problems in some of its cars before announcing a massive recall last month, according to a person briefed on the matter.

The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is expected to center on whether GM, the nation’s largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects.

The action is the latest in a widening series of investigations of GM’s handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.

On Tuesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said he would ask Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks, a spokesman for Rockefeller said.

A House committee on Monday said it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM’s recall of 1.6 million vehicles, and sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

NHTSA is also investigating GM’s actions since the company first learned of possible defects in its ignition systems in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own internal review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll accidents.

It is rare but not unprecedented for the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against an auto company for how it handles recalls.

The department, for example, is currently in discussions with Toyota about settling a four-year criminal investigation into how the Japanese automaker disclosed complaints related to unintended acceleration of its vehicles.

The GM inquiry, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company’s admission to NHTSA on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches at various times over the past 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.

When asked on Tuesday about the criminal inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment.

One safety advocate said the Justice Department investigation is likely to center on whether GM withheld information from regulators in violation of the Safety Act.

“It’s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,” said Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington.###47||One-hundred Yuan notes are seen in this picture illustration.

Shanghai - China's yuan weakened against the dollar on Monday after the central bank doubled the currency's trading band as part of broad financial reforms as the government seeks to remake the world's second-largest economy. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) said Saturday it would allow the yuan to move up or down two percent daily - double the previous one percent - either side of a mid-point set under the guidance of the bank, which says it polls market makers.

The yuan was trading at 6.1625 to the dollar by early afternoon Monday, the first trading day after the reform, compared with Friday's close of 6.1502, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.

Analysts said the move to widen the band would introduce greater volatility in trading on the national foreign exchange market, but stressed the central bank could still exercise control over the yuan.

“We view this move as another major step in the direction of allowing the market to play a more important role in exchange rate setting,” investment bank Goldman Sachs said in research note released Monday.

But it added: “If the PBoC wish they can still move the rate in the direction they want, since this band only affects how much (the) rate can move intra-day.”

Policymakers have pledged to move gradually towards full convertibility of the yuan - also known as the renminbi -

allowing it to be freely bought and sold, and bringing with it the uncontrolled movement of funds in and out of China.

China keeps a tight grip on its capital account - investment and financial transactions, rather than those related to trade -

on worries that unpredictable flows of funds could harm the economy and reduce its control over it.

Beijing has widened the trading band previously, most recently moving from 0.5 percent to one percent in 2012. But the latest move comes under the new leadership after a decade-long period when financial reforms largely slowed.

“Increasing the flexibility of the exchange rate has been a long-term objective oft stated by the government... So much so that the market has been somewhat disappointed that this did not occur in 2013,” said Wang Tao, head of China economic research for investment bank UBS.

The yuan steadily appreciated against the US dollar last year, rising more than three percent, following complaints by the United States and China's other major trading partners that the currency was vastly under-valued.

But last month the Chinese unit suddenly reversed course, at one point closing at an eight-month low, in what dealers believed to be a deliberate move by the central bank to target speculative funds betting on continued rises.

“Now, it is even clearer that the purpose of the depreciation was mostly intended to prepare the market for two-way volatility,” Societe Generale Group's China economist Yao Wei said.

Major currencies and even key emerging market units do not usually move more than the four percent maximum intraday change now allowed for the yuan, she added.

Analysts expect the Chinese unit to be slightly weaker to stable this week after the move but some forecast it could still move higher for the full year.

“Fundamentals still point to a stronger currency over the medium term,” Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams said.

“Greater volatility is likely over the months ahead, but as a result of official intervention not market forces,” he said. - Sapa-AFP###48||Empty###49||Empty###50||Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

In documents disclosed to federal regulators, GM said it had found some sort of issue contributing to the ignition's inner workings which have now been linked to a recall of 1.6 million vehicles and 12 deaths.

The auto maker said an ignition switch design change had resolved the problem. However, a service technician at an unnamed dealership observed the Ion stall while driving. In a report, it was noted that the owner "had several keys on the key ring" and that the additional weight of the keys had "worn out the ignition switch."

The service technician replaced the switch and the report was closed. GM went on to say there were other reports of complaints from customers not able to start their Ion engines. The auto maker declined to offer details.

GM disclosed the findings in its updated chronology of events that led to the February recall of millions of vehicles submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday. NHTSA posted the information on its website Wednesday.

Originally, the first reports of ignition switch problems and stalling centered around the launch of the Chevrolet Cobalt in 2004.

The component at the heart of the recall costs a few dollars to make and minutes to install, according to its manufacturer, auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive PLC, which could provoke more questions about why the problem wasn't fixed years ago.

Delphi told Wall Street analysts this week it expects to spend between $2 to $5 to produce a replacement ignition switch that can then be "swapped out" in a matter of minutes by mechanics at GM dealerships. The figure was reported in a research note written by JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, who was among a group of analysts who met with Delphi leaders.

Delphi, which manufactured the original switch, corroborated the report but offered no additional comment.

The figure suggests GM may spend about $8 million on replacement switches, while also keeping dealership labor costs in check.

GM faces multiple investigations--including a federal criminal probe--aimed at determining why the auto maker didn't act sooner to fix the faulty ignition switches.

"We have to get to the bottom of this," said Sen. Claire McCaskill, (D.-Mo.), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer protection, who said she would hold a hearing in April concerning the GM recall. "We need to find out who dropped the ball and put millions of Americans at risk."

GM has said its employees learned of an incident in 2004 in which a Cobalt lost engine power after the ignition key was jarred out of the "on" position, disabling the car's air bags. The car was about to be launched at the time. GM employees replicated the problem in test drives, according to documents submitted to safety regulators by GM.

An engineering inquiry was opened but later closed "after consideration of the lead time required, cost and effectiveness' of the solution offered by GM engineers," according to GM.

It wouldn't be until sometime during the 2007 model year of the Chevrolet Cobalt that the ignition switch was redesigned. But GM didn't recall the Cobalts or other cars with similar ignition locks until last month.

The problem occurred when drivers would turn the key from the "off" position, through the "accessory" position to the "on" position. However, the switch's detent plunger and spring inside allowed the ignition switch to turn back to the "accessory" position when the key was either bumped or there was too much weight hanging from the key's head.

GM declined to comment on the timeline and the switch issue beyond the documentation it has already submitted to the NHTSA.

Separately, GM said Wednesday it has authorized U.S. dealers to give any owner of a car covered in the recall, and unhappy with the vehicle, a $500 cash allowance to buy or lease a new GM product. The allowance is available through April 30 and can be used on a new 2013, 2014 or 2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac.

"In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special, $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle," spokesman Greg Martin said. "We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM, nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance."

The issue of the cost of the ignition switches and the delays in replacing them will likely be just one facet of the investigations under way. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has begun looking into the auto maker's handling of complaints about faulty ignition switches. The probe is at a preliminary stage. The House Energy and Commerce Committee also said it would investigate the case and hold hearings.

The auto maker is also facing an April 3 deadline in answering 107 questions posed by NHTSA concerning GM's timeline on the events leading to the recall. NHTSA is trying to decide if GM was noncompliant in the time it took to initiate the recall.

Meanwhile, owners of the vehicles can't get their cars repaired until April, when GM plans to begin repairing switches in 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, the 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and the 2007 Saturn Sky.

GM is taking steps to reassure consumers and regulators that it now is committed to addressing the problem. The auto maker earlier this week said Chicago attorney Anton Valukas, who served as the examiner of the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., will help lead an internal probe of the handling of the ignition-switch recall.

Morningstar Inc. senior equity analyst David Whiston, along with JP Morgan's Mr. Brinkman, said the company is likely to shake off any short-term market-share loss.

"The company may well lose sales in the short run because of constant negative headlines, but the impact to its reputation depends on how Chief Executive Mary Barra and her team respond over the next few months, " Mr. Whiston said in a research note. "We expect GM will continue to take responsibility and admit fault in how it handled the process."

The not-for-profit Center for Auto Safety on Wednesday called on GM to establish a $1 billion victims fund and asked the auto maker to waive immunity it received under its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring from most lawsuits.

A GM spokesman had no comment.

Bouygues also said it was “committed to facilitate the liquidity of Vivendi’s interest in the new entity.” A spokesman said that meant Vivendi may be allowed to sell part of its 43 percent stake to financial investors before the business is launched on the stock market via an initial public offering (IPO).

The transaction will create a fresh produce company worth about $4.6 billion in annual revenues and it is expected to generate operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016.

Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7% of the combined company, ChiquitaFyffes, while Fyffes shareholders will have the remaining 49.3%, the companies said in a statement on Monday. The New York-listed combined company will have tax savings from being domiciled in Ireland, similar to US drugmaker Perrigo's acquisition of Elan last year.

Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38% over its Friday's closing price. Fyffes shares jumped 29% to 1.15 euros by 0710 GMT.

The deal could raise antitrust issues, given that more than 80% of the global banana market is controlled by four multinationals Chiquita, Fyffes, Fresh Del Monte and Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company according to the United Nations.

The Malaysia Airlines (MAS) jet was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on an overnight flight when it disappeared.

"Rolls-Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS and investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised."

He also said China had told Malaysia that satellite photos released on the website of a Chinese state oceanic agency, apparently showing three large objects in a suspected crash site, were released "by mistake and did not show any debris."

A huge search effort has failed to find any evidence of the plane&39;s fate despite scouring land and sea for six days.

It has been repeatedly dogged by false leads and conflicting information, drawing mounting accusations that Malaysia is bungling the response.

The effort involves dozens of vessels and aircraft from countries around Asia, plus the United States.

The Chinese agency&39;s images had prompted Malaysia and Vietnam to dispatch planes to the area in question in the South China Sea to hunt for the suspect objects.

"The publication of the images on the website is an accident," Hishammuddin said, relating a statement he said he had received from China&39;s ambassador to Malaysia.

He said the Chinese government did not endorse the action and was investigating.###56||How to set-up Family Sharing in iOS 8###57||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Applications volume has dropped in three of the past four weeks according to MBA, as interest rates have generally ticked higher. That trend is a reversal from the beginning of the year, when lower interest rates led to modest growth in application volume.

On an unadjusted basis, the MBA said the market composite slipped 1% from a week earlier. The refinance index dropped 3%, while the seasonally adjusted purchase index fell 1%.

The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loans grew to 4.52% from 4.47% the previous week. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo-loan balances increased to 4.41% from 4.37%.

The average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration climbed to 4.18% from 4.13% the prior week.

The average rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 3.53% from 3.52%. The 5/1 ARM average increased to 3.18% from 3.09%.

Dublin-based fruit supplier Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world's largest banana company.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of $4.6bn (€3.31bn) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7pc of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at $526m.

The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: "Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

"We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers."

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world's oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland.

WASHINGTON — Government-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could send about $179.2 billion in profits to taxpayers during the next 10 years if the terms of their bailout remain intact, the White House budget office said on Monday.

The amount is more than triple the estimated 10-year payments calculated last year in the White House budget proposal, driven by the companies' increased profitability.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under federal conservatorship since 2008, when regulators agreed to inject capital into the companies to keep them afloat.

They received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds, but they have returned to profitability, and by the end of March, they will have had paid $202.9 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury.

No one expected them to become profitable again so quickly, but when home prices surged in 2012, they were able to recover more money than expected on soured loans.

The profit projections were made in an addendum to President Obama's fiscal 2015 budget proposal. In a budget proposal last year, the administration estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would send the Treasury $51 billion through 2023.

Under a 2012 revamp of their bailout terms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac send a majority of their profits to the Treasury as dividends, and they are unable to repurchase the controlling share the government took when it bailed them out. Previously, they were required to pay only a 10 percent dividend on their bailout funds in profitable quarters.

Shareholders, including Perry Capital and Fairholme Capital Management, have sued the United States over the changes. They argue that since the companies are returning profits to taxpayers, the government's stake should shrink.###61||###62||Dublin-based King said it expects to price its IPO at $US21 to $US24 per share, valuing it at up to $US7.6 billion – slightly higher than Hasbro, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly and Scrabble. "I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realise a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house. Twitter's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook's shares have fuelled speculation other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square. However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate. "I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a scepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark." Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 per cent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com until it was bought by InterActive in 2002. Another Zynga? Candy Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later. The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra lives.

Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $US602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $US22 million in the first quarter of 2012. But most of that growth was fuelled by Candy Crush rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website. King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market analysts expect will grow to $US17 billion this year from just $US6 billion in 2010. Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of Farmville waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of Angry Birds. Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $US527 million and cut more than 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 per cent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in Candy Crush gross bookings. However, bookings rose for its other games such as Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga. About 73 per cent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users. King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. . "The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent." NYSE debut

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters said. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26. Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said. Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $US714.3 million in 2013. In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day. At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $US532.8 million, slightly more than the $US500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.###63||PARIS, March 13 (Reuters) - Below are company-related news and stories from French and Benelux media which could have an impact on the region’s markets or individual stocks.

Vodafone said it expected to achieve cost and capital expenditure synergies of approximately 240 million euros, before integration costs by the fourth full year after completion.

For Vodafone, a purchase of the private equity-owned Ono would be its third European fixed-broadband acquisition in two years as the company seeks to improve its networks and shore up its European businesses after the $130 billion sale of its U.S. arm.

Ono, which sells fixed and mobile phone, TV and internet services, has 1.9 million customers.###66||Vodafone has hailed the opening of a new chapter in its history after agreeing a £6bn deal for Spanish cable operator Ono, the first since the sale of its $130bn (£78bn) US operations.

The company confirmed the €7.2bn acquisition on Monday morning after reaching the deal at the weekend. The combined unit will become Spain’s second-biggest telecoms operator, challenging the dominance of the incumbent Telefonica, and is a step towards Vodafone’s goal of becoming a major player in fixed-line services as well as its mobile business.

Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s chief executive, said the deal would create “a leading integrated communications provider in Spain” and that the company is now “a more unified provider, not just a mobile one”. Since agreeing to sell Vodafone’s prize asset – its 45pc stake in the US mobile operator Verizon Wireless – last September, Mr Colao has quickly set to work investing the proceeds of the $130bn deal, with Ono the first major acquisition in the post-Verizon era.

The company had also previously agreed to the £6.5bn takeover of Germany’s Kabel Deutschland , and is putting £7bn into “Project Spring” , the development of its own infrastructure, as it becomes a so-called “quad-play” operator – selling broadband, landline and television services as well as mobile.

However, Mr Colao ruled out any imminent acquisitions in the UK, where Vodafone does not have a fixed-line offering for consumers. He shut down suggestions that the company was interested in ITV, a rumoured target, or Channel 5, which its owner Richard Desmond has put up for sale .

“For the time being the UK is not a quad-play market. We continue to have a mostly mobile consumer strategy,” Mr Colao said. “Every market has different dynamics, [in the UK] we are focused on commercial agreements with others for the time being.”

Ono, which has 1.9m customers in Spain and a high-speed network that can reach 7m homes, will be bought using cash and debt. The deal was agreed in Madrid over the weekend after Vodafone quickly moved to block Ono’s threat of listing the business. Previous bids from as low as €6.5bn had been rejected by Ono’s shareholders.

The Spanish company is majority owned by New York private equity groups Thomas H Lee Partners, Providence Equity Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital. It made a pre-tax profit of €1.1bn last year, and Vodafone claimed it had potential to reach a much larger audience – claiming it had far fewer customers as a proportion of its network than European counterparts such as Virgin Media.

Further acquisitions are likely to be on the cards as Vodafone decides how to spend the remaining proceeds of the Verizon sale, the majority of which has been handed to shareholders. Nick Read, the incoming chief financial officer, said the £18bn of debt that Vodafone will carry after completing the Ono deal equated to around 1.5 times earnings, below the multiple of two the company is aiming for in the near term.###67||* Euro looks to test $1.40 resistance level

* Concerns over Ukraine, China slowdown and copper rout sap risk appetite

* Gold hits 6-month high; euro, Swiss franc 2 1/2-year high vs dollar

By Alistair Smout

LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a new 2-1/2 year high against the dollar on Thursday as concerns over Chinese growth and political tensions in Ukraine took the fizz out of an attempted rebound in riskier assets.

The euro reached $1.3967 and looked set to test psychological resistance at a $1.40, in a possible sign that the currency is regaining safe-haven status following the currency bloc’s prolonged sovereign debt crisis.

The euro zone’s economic recovery seems to be picking up steam even as the European Central Bank resists pressure to ease policy further to counter deflation risks.

“The policy messages and data support the euro and we think that will allow it to continue to push higher from here,” said Ian Stannard, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in London.

More traditional safe-havens also strengthened, with the Swiss franc extending gains against the dollar to 0.87095 francs - its strongest since late 2011. The Japanese yen also firmed.

Stock markets in Europe edged higher but remained pinned near one-month lows, with a 0.1 percent rise in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 barely recouping any of the 1.1 percent drop in the previous session.

The move echoed trading in Asia, where MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan managed to rise 0.5 percent, clawing back half the previous day’s losses, despite concerns over Chinese growth that limited gains.

Soft Chinese data dented many markets. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.1 percent, erasing gains made after Japanese machinery orders beat expectations, while South Korean shares also lost most of their earlier gains.

China’s industrial output growth came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries that growth could slow as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.

“The China economy is slowing quite sharply, in our view... (although) the lack of inflation and slowing growth does open the door for policy easing,” Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said in a note.

The MSCI All-Country World index edged up 0.2 percent, not far from an eight-day low hit on Wednesday, while U.S. futures also pointed to a slightly higher open.

A major victim of concerns over China, copper dropped 0.3 percent to $6,485.50 a tonne, a day after it hit a four-year low at $6376.25.

After a tumble in copper of around 7.5 percent so far this month, investors are worried about a possible unravelling of Chinese loan deals using the metal - whose many industrial uses make it sensitive to global economic health - as collateral.

Also providing a boost to safe haven assets was the ongoing situation in Ukraine, as the diplomatic stalemate between Russia and the West over Crimea continued.

Gold hit a six-month high of $1,374.85, while U.S. Treasuries have erased all the losses made following last week’s strong payrolls data. The benchmark 10-year yield was 2.74 percent on Thursday versus its six-week high of 2.82 percent hit last Friday.

The European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.

“Markets are nervous over China and Ukraine, with the latter weighing the most because of the uncertainty of what will happen next and the seeming lack of any coordinated or effective response,” Titan Investment Partners trader Darren Sinden said.

Geopolitical tension also supported oil. The European benchmark Brent held relatively firm at $107.88 as it drew support from the unfolding crisis in Ukraine.

U.S. crude futures steadied, although they remained near one-month lows hit on Wednesday after Washington announced a surprise plan for a test release of strategic oil reserves.

In debt markets, Irish government bond yields hit new record lows before Dublin’s first regular debt auction since its 2010 bailout, seen as a post-crisis watershed for the country.

Investors expected a solid auction result, which some said could be a catalyst for another leg in the Irish debt rally which has taken 10-year yields to just below 3 percent from a peak of over 15 percent in 2011.

“This return to domestic bond auctions is the final stage of Ireland regaining full access to capital markets,” said Sandra Holdsworth, an investment manager at Kames Capital.

“We expect Thursday’s auction to pass successfully... However, one note of caution: at current levels of yield there is little margin to protect investors should the economic outlook worsen or fiscal discipline be lost.”###68||Empty###69||Nasdaq Building

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open on Wednesday, as concerns over the economy in China and ongoing tensions in Ukraine continued to weigh on market sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.16% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.19% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.24% decline.

Investors remained cautious amid worries over the outlook for China’s economy after data over the weekend showed that exports dropped 18.1% in February and inflation slowed.

Markets were also eyeing the standoff between Russia and the West over Ukraine. Ukraine’s interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was to travel to the U.S. to meet President Barack Obama on Wednesday, as diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continued.

The auto sector was likely to be in focus, after U.S. Governor Chris Christie’s administration blocked Tesla Motors Inc. from direct auto sales. The electric-car maker said the move could shutter its only two stores in New Jersey and sent shares down 1.67% in pre-market trade.

Facebook was also expected to be in the spotlight, after the headquarters of the social media giant in Northern California were evacuated late Tuesday, as a suspected threat to the company caused it to contact police. Shares slipped 0.20% in early trading.

Elsewhere, the Walt Disney Company was up 0.56% pre-market amid reports it has been talking to Maker Studios about an acquisition that would value the YouTube network at $500 million or more.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was also slated to be in focus, as its BNSF Railway Co. was said to be leading an effort by U.S. railroads to add hundreds of locomotives to ease a cargo jam spurred by bad weather and surging crude shipments.

Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply lower. The EURO STOXX 50 lost 1.08%, France’s CAC 40 tumbled 1.27%, Germany's DAX retreated 1.22%, while Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 0.90%.

)###72||Empty###73||Fixed-rate mortgages have gained an edge over variable-rate mortgages given the improving economy and attractive offers on longer-term deals, says a new report from economists at one of Canada's big banks.

"Fixed now modestly trumps variable," according to a BMO Nesbitt Burns study published Thursday.

While many mortgage brokers agree with that assessment, others caution that locking into a fixed rate is not the best way to go.

Story continues below advertisement

Historically low interest rates have dramatically narrowed the spread between five-year fixed mortgage rates and variable ones, according to the report by BMO Nesbitt Burns chief economist Douglas Porter and senior economist Benjamin Reitzes.

Added to that are improving economic conditions and the likelihood of rate hikes from both the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve next year, they say.

"While we have in the past supported going variable, and even though short-term rates are likely to remain low this year, current offers on long-term mortgage rates and the improving economic outlook tilt the balance in favour of locking in at this stage," the authors say.

Five-year rates of 2.99 per cent can still be found and that compares favourably to the roughly 2.5-per-cent rate offered on variable mortgages, said David Hughes, a mortgage agent with Mortgage Group Ontario Inc.

"I don't see how you can go wrong getting a five-year mortgage at 2.99 per cent," he said.

But mortgage planner David Larock says the BMO study "sounds like another chapter in the age-old fixed versus variable debate – and the banks have largely been saying that fixed rates are the way to go for years now, even in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary.

"I am always a little cynical of this stock advice when given by the banks because their fixed-rate mortgages are much more profitable, and convenient, because advising borrowers to take the more conservative path is easily defensible, even if it proves more expensive over time," he said in an e-mail.

Vince Gaetano, principal broker with MonsterMortgage.ca, agrees.

"Banks are very good at scaring variable-rate clients into locking in prematurely. This took place last year when fixed rates spiked temporarily only to fall again. At the same time, variable-rate discounts have increased," he said.

The BMO report, meanwhile, says the bond market has been signalling strongly for the past year that "the era of low interest rates may be finally drawing to a close.

"As bond yields rise, the cost of funds for lenders also rises, ultimately putting upward pressure on consumer and business borrowing costs, including long-term mortgage rates. So, even if variable rates take some time to climb, we may not see such low fixed rates again any time soon."

Historically, fixed rates have proven to be more expensive than variable rates.

"Fully 85 per cent of the time since 1975, the cost-effective route for borrowers was to stay variable," the report said.

"Considering the likely upward trend in interest rates as the global recovery picks up speed in 2014, this may be one of those rare periods when a fixed rate turns out to be the superior choice."

There are other reasons why locking into a five-year mortgage may not be for everyone, says another mortgage broker and industry expert.

It could be a disadvantage for homeowners who are considering a move in the near future or mulling a refinancing of their property, said Robert McLister, editor of Canadian Mortgage Trends.

"The bank penalties are not so friendly," he said.

On average, though, "mathematically speaking I think the five-year fixed is the best value in the market right now."

The BMO report refers to another – less tangible – factor favouring fixed rates: peace of mind.

The borrower "gets certainty with a fixed rate, and that certainty is worth something to many. A small premium on fixed-rate mortgages and shorter amortization schedule represent inexpensive protection against a rate spike.

"For those who don't have much financial flexibility, and would run into difficulty from a pronounced upswing in interest rates (typically first-time buyers), any potential extra cost for peace of mind now appears to be a price well worth paying."###74||Over the weekend, hackers stole the database of the failed Bitcoin exchange MtGox, hijacked the blog and Reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles — and published the former via the latter. The data appears to show that MtGox did not have all its bitcoins cleaned out by hackers, as it claimed when it went bankrupt.

“Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,” the hackers wrote in the document they published. No user data was included, but some of those “specialized tools” linked to in the document turned out to be Bitcoin wallet-stealing malware (taken down by the host, once Redditors notified it.)

If you can’t trust an angry cryptocurrency-fanatic hacker to dump a risk-free executable file into the wild, who can you trust?

Sarcasm aside, the leaked information appears to bolster the case of those who suspect Karpeles of defrauding his customers. The way Karpeles and his lawyers told it, hackers had stolen 750,000 bitcoins belonging to MtGox’s customers and 100,000 belonging to the exchange itself, supposedly leaving nothing.

According to the data leaked on the weekend, MtGox actually still has 951,116 bitcoins. This detail is accompanied in the document by a strongly-worded suggestion that Karpeles has been less than honest. One bitcoin is currently worth around $620, so that would be roughly $590 million worth.

That said, by MtGox’s version of events, the exchange only recently noticed that the 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen a long time – perhaps even years – ago. There’s no evidence that the outfit ever conducted a proper audit of what it did and didn’t actually hold, so the possibility remains that the information leaked over the weekend is just plain wrong.

Either way, that’s not even the end of the risky business floating around the MtGox collapse. The exchange also put out a notice on Saturday, warning that its former users were being targeted by spam/phishing emails, dressed up to look like MtGox emails and asking for MtGox and bank account details.

“We highly recommend not to respond to these emails,” MtGox said in the notice. That much, certainly, is true.###75||Revelation adds to suspicions that 1 or both of the pilots were involved in the disappearance.###76||Empty###77||After almost five hours of questions, Andrew Tyrie finally called the Treasury select committee’s grilling of Mark Carney to a halt. The chairman admitted that, over a “long and demanding morning”, the Governor had been quizzed on a range of subjects that would ordinarily have been spread over several separate sessions.

The potentially explosive issue of whether the Bank turned a blind eye to manipulation of the foreign exchange markets was left until last. But by then, the Governor, who was given a distinctly more rocky ride than on his debut, had already faced a series of awkward questions – and raised some eyebrows at the same time.

In a bombshell for Alex Salmond, Mr Carney said it was a “distinct possibility” that the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group would have to shift their headquarters out of Scotland following a “yes” vote in September. The Governor insisted that he was strictly neutral on the referendum but argued that European rules, such as those on passporting, made it likely that the taxpayer-backed banks would quit Scotland.

Asked if the Bank of England could continue to provide services to Scottish institutions, from settlements to being lender of last resort, Mr Carney was notably non-committal.

“We can act as lender of last resort to branches of foreign banks, but we don’t have to,” he said. The Bank would have to “evaluate the suitability” of Scottish banks before agreeing to any oversight, he said, including the “credibility and viability of monetary policy” behind them.

He agreed with MPs that the banks’ case would be helped if they were still part of the European Union or overseen by the European Banking Authority, but that other factors would matter, too: “It’s a bit like being pregnant, you can’t be half-viable in a currency union.”

The Governor surprised MPs by saying Scottish independence was “not a priority” at the Bank since all major political parties had ruled it out. “This is a risk that’s coming down the line very fast, Governor,” Mr Tyrie warned. Mr Carney retorted that the Bank was “well advised of the risks”.

Forward guidance

Large parts of the Governor’s two-hour grilling on the inflation report was taken up by an attack on his flagship Forward Guidance policy. Mr Carney was accused of switching “explicit guidance” – his policy that the Bank would only review interest rates once unemployment dropped below 7pc – for “18 new goalposts” and “fuzzy guidance”.

To the charge that he was wrong-footed by the fast drop in the jobless rate, Mr Carney snapped back: “I have absolutely no regrets that we’re sitting here in March with half a million more people in work.”

However, MPC member Martin Weale said the drop had “reinforced” his doubts about the policy. Mr Carney also revealed he was among the dovish policymakers arguing that the spare capacity in the economy was slightly more than the 1.5pc of GDP view held by the MPC.

Quantitative easing

The Bank’s £375bn emergency money printing programme may never be wound down, Mr Carney told MPs.

The Governor agreed that the sale of the gilt stock, bought with electronically created money at the apex of the financial crisis, would have a big impact on debt markets, but he added: “We’re not going to sell £375bn of gilts. That’s a hypothetical question, purely hypothetical.”

He said an unwinding would not take place before “several adjustments” to interest rates. Even then, he said the Treasury would not have a say in the decision. “With respect to the Treasury, it’s a monetary policy decision,” he said.

Property boom

Mr Carney told MPs that the Bank “does not have tools to directly affect” the property boom fuelled by foreign cash buyers. But he said he and the Bank officials were carefully monitoring the mortgage market in case of risks. Asked about George Osborne’s Help to Buy Scheme, the Governor said he’s keeping a “very close eye” on it.

Destroyed recordings

In an admission that just slipped out, Paul Fisher, director of markets, said recordings of MPC meetings are automatically destroyed, leaving just the minutes as a record.

He said the “free-flowing discussion” of nine economists was difficult to follow once it had been described. Mr Tyrie was appalled and demanded that the policy be reviewed. After the meeting, Mr Tyrie said records should be kept to “bolster public confidence that the minutes published after MPC hearings are an accurate reflection of what was said”.###78||8:18 PM ET Tue, 21 Aug 2018

The update will start rolling out on March 19 for Starbucks App users in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. The update will not only bring the new barista tipping feature, but it will also, according to the announcement, improve the overall experience of the app. Easier access to a user’s account details along with their My Starbucks Rewards information will be added with the update. In-app Barista tipping will be available at over 7,000 Starbucks branches in the U.S.

“With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we’re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,” said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks. “This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we’ll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come.”

According to MyStarbucksidea.com, one of the company’s online communities, the digital tipping features has been one of the top suggestions in the community. The company has said that it also plans to bring the feature to Android phone users, but they will have to wait until sometime later this year for it.

“As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have also asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to store partners,” said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S., Americas, and Teavana. “We’re proud to offer digital tipping as an option through the updated Starbucks for iPhone® app for customers in the U.S.”

Along with the digital tipping feature, the Starbucks app already has a slew of features available for the customer’s use, including the Mobile Payment feature, Shake to Pay, automatic reloading via mobile device, a Starbucks store locator, and the ability to purchase and send Starbucks Card eGifts.###81||Empty###82||* Tumbling Chinese export data helps limit gold losses * Tensions over Ukraine hurt stocks, support gold * Largest gold ETF reports first inflow since Feb. 25 (Adds comment, second byline, dateline, updates market activities) By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey NEW YORK/LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Gold prices were little changed on Monday as disappointing Chinese export data helped underpin the market, with bullion investors closely monitoring the latest development in the standoff in Ukraine between Russia and the West. Earlier in the session, the yellow metal was trading lower, extending Friday's weakness after a strong February U.S. job report. The market later recouped initial losses as investors turned their focus to a report from China which showed the world's second-largest economy posted an unexpected tumble in export in February. With diplomacy at a standstill, gold did not respond from the worst standoff between Russia and the West since the Cold War. On Monday, Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks resolving the Ukraine crisis. "Provided there is no escalation in the Ukraine crisis, there's no urgency for fresh buyers to enter at current price," said Edel Tully, precious metals strategist at UBS. Tully said that, however, gold's ability to hold above key lows despite strong U.S. job data on Friday suggests gold buyers should hold onto their bullish positions in the longer run. Spot gold inched down 5 cents to $1,339.80 an ounce by 2:45 p.m. EDT (1845 GMT) U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $3.30 an ounce at $1,341.50, with trading volume in line with its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. Also supporting gold prices were lower U.S. stocks on the soft data out of China and lingering concerns over Russia's claim over part of Ukraine. Commodities in general sold off after a surprise fall in China's exports, with copper sinking to 8-1/2-month lows, while oil prices also fell. CHINESE GOLD AT DISCOUNT Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than $20 at the beginning of the year. The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, said its holdings rose 1.5 tonnes on Friday, its first inflow since Feb. 25. Among institutional investors in gold, hedge fund manager John Paulson's returns soared last month as gold rallied and bets on telecommunications and energy companies paid off.

The filing comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures. The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.

It said it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., said its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent.###85||Empty###86||* Jan-Feb property investment growth eases to 19.3 pct y/y

* Revenues from property sales drop 3.7 pct

* New contruction work down sharply

* Adds to views economy losing momentum

BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - China’s real estate investment slowed in the first two months of 2014 while sales dropped from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, the latest signs of cooling in the property market as the broader economy as slows.

Real estate investment, which affects more than 40 other sectors from cement and steel to furniture, rose 19.3 percent in the January to February period from the same period a year ago, slower than the 19.8 percent annual growth in 2013, the National Bureau of Statistics said.

Property sales in terms of floor space dropped 0.1 percent and fell 3.7 percent in terms of value in the first two months, the agency said in a statement on its website, www.stats.gov.cn

That compared with increases of 17.3 percent (measured by floor space) and 26.3 percent (by value), respectively, in 2013 as a whole.

Floor space newly started for construction slumped 27.4 percent in January-February compared with growth of 13.5 percent in 2013.

China’s red-hot property market has shown signs of losing steam since late 2013 as local governments took further tightening measures and banks gradually tightened lending to this sector.

A mild cooling in the market could be welcomed by the government, which has spent more than four years trying to tame rising home prices. But a sharp correction in prices nationwide that could drag down the economy is the scenario the government is trying to avoid.

China will continue to curb speculative housing demand this year while employing differentiated policies in different cities based on various local conditions, Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Thursday in a media conference at the end of China’s annual parliament session.

State media last week quoted Vice Housing Minister Qiu Baoxing as saying that it is impossible for China’s property market to have big crisis within 10 years.###87||Troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox was reportedly attacked 150,000 times per second by hackers in the days leading up to its collapse last month.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February, was hit with crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

During DDoS attacks, hackers take control of multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, causing servers to crash and making websites unavailable.

Lawyers for MtGox said that during the attacks, which lasted for several days, 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers were stolen, worth an estimated $575m (£344m).

Unlike traditional currencies, which are backed by central banks, Bitcoin is created by complex interactions between a large network of computers across the globe.

Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, said that it has no control over virtual currencies which are not backed by any central authorities. Several countries, such as Russia and China, have placed heavy restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used.

MtGox was founded in 2010 by programmer Jed McCaleb, who sold the company to Tibanne Co. in March 2011. It became the world’s largest marketplace for Bitcoins, handling an estimated 80pc of all transactions of the digital currency.

Last week, more than 400 people signalled that they would join a class action lawsuit against MtGox, according to British law firm Selachii.

It is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins from the exchange.

Richard Howlett, co-founder of Selachii, said: “On the back of the MtGox collapse, a lot of people say they feel the truth is not being stated.”

Mark Karpeles, chief executive of MtGox, apologised for the collapse at a news conference earlier this month, blaming a “weakness in our system”, but predicted that the market will grow.###88||2 Minutes ago

That aside, it looks as if those that serve millions each day with a myriad of offerings and misspelled names might be getting a raise today. Not from the company, of course, but rather by the inclusion of digital tipping to the popular iPhone application used by over 10% of Starbucks’ customers each day.

Starbucks’ tipping app: New features

On March 19th, users of the app will be allowed to tip their baristas $0.50, $1.00, or $2.00 for serving them. While the amount you can drop in the physical tip jar is up to you, for now digital tips will be limited to those amounts.

“With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we’re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,” said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). “This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we’ll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come.”

By popular request

Digital tipping has been one of the most requested ideas on MyStarbucksIdea.com, an online forum designed to enhance customers’ experience with the coffee chain. While, Starbucks operates over 11,000 stores in the United States, at least to begin with tipping with the iPhone will be limited to 7,000 locations.

While iPhone users in both the U.K and Canada will receive the new streamlined app next week, only the version in the States will feature the option to leave a little digital something for baristas…er…partners. An updated app for Android is expected later this year and presumably will also offer the option for customers to digitally tip.

“As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to our store partners,” said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S., Americas and Teavana. “We’re proud to offer digital tipping as an option through the updated Starbucks App for iPhone to customers in the U.S.”

In addition to the gratuity option, a “Shake to Pay” option will be added to the already feature rich app, that will bring the barcode of their Starbucks Card to the front of their device simply by shaking their phone.###90||investment choice at home and abroad

Smaller format stores are all the rage these days. Dollar General, which already operates nearly 12,000 stores, plans to open 700 more units this year. Walmart recently announced plans to accelerate growth of its smaller format stores by opening between 270 and 300 small stores, more than double the 120 to 150 store range it projected last fall. Even Target has gotten in on the action with plans to open its first Target Express store near downtown Minneapolis this summer.

With some of the nation’s largest retailers relying on accelerated growth of smaller stores to drive growth, one company with a differentiated concept and a downright glacial pace of expansion is called UTBW, an acronym for “Used To Be Woolworth’s.”

Stores operate under the banner of Five & Dime General Store and the closest location to Northwest Arkansas is in Brandon, Mo., adjacent to a Bass Pro Shops.

The Santa Fe, N.M.-based company only has nine stores in an unusual mix of locations such as San Antonio, Kansas City, Charleston, San Diego, Monterrey, Calif., and Savanah, Ga. The company has been deliberating over opening a tenth location in St. Augustine, Fla., for more than a year. Earl Potter, a Stanford trained lawyer turned retail entrepreneur serves as chairman and Mike Collins, a veteran retailer who spent 25 years at Woolworths, is CEO.

The Five & Dime stores and the company itself are throwbacks to an era when retail was a simpler business. The company employs an old school intuitive approach to merchandising and supply chain matters to generate enviable levels of productivity.

“We are not high tech in the sense that we rely on advanced algorithms about where to put our stores or what to put in our stores,” Potter said. “We have no centralized distribution or anything like that, but we have some very experienced people who are old school merchants and very sensitive to what is selling and what isn’t.”

Relying on intuition for purchasing and replenishment decisions is easier to do when stores range in size from 2,500-sq.-ft. to 4,000-sq.-ft. and experienced operators are in place. The company also relies on McKesson to help with health and beauty categories.

“We carry a lot of item that are found in a traditional convenience store, but we will also have some softgoods, hardware, snack food items, toys for kids and items that are locally relevant,” Potter said.

The combination has been effective. Sales last year exceeded $13 million and Potter said sales per square foot range from $400 to $1,000 depending on the location and maturity of the store. And unlike other value oriented retailers who rely on low margin food and consumable to generate traffic, most of the items in the Five & Dime stores carry higher margins.

For the model to work Potter said stores need to be in locations with high levels of foot traffic.

“Our stores are not typically a destination, but the areas in which we are located are destinations,” Potter said.

As a result, the company is very methodical in its site selection to ensure every location generates strong sales and achieves profitability.

“We’re very conservative when it comes to expansion and I’m not sure how many locations will work for our concept. We don’t claim to have something that can be stamped out,” Potter said. “Our model depends on having a closely knit management team.”###92||37% adults favor rising age for Social Security or working past 65. Medicare recipients attend at a news conference celebrating the 46th anniversary of Medicare in Washington on July 27, 2011. UPI/Kevin Dietsch | License Photo

NEW YORK, March 15 (UPI) -- U.S. adults favor raising the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare or encouraging people to work past age 65 given the options on the table.

The Harris Poll gave survey respondents five choices and asked what they thought should happen over the next five years to meet the increasing costs of baby boomers retiring while controlling the federal budget deficit.

Thirty-seven percent chose increasing the age at which one is eligible for Social Security and Medicare, while the same percentage favored encouraging people 65 and older to work past the age of 65.

The survey of 2,266 U.S. adults conducted online Feb. 12 to 17 found roughly one-fourth favored increasing taxes while 1-in-10 said Medicare benefits should be cut and 7 percent said Social Security benefits should be cut.

RELATED GOP bill would end income taxes on Social Security payments

When asked which two of the five policy options people would choose if they had to pick two, the overall percentages grow but the rankings remained relatively unchanged. Fifty-four percent favored encouraging more more people to work at age 65 and older, while 53 percent favored increasing the age of eligibility, 36 percent wanted to increase taxes, while 9 percent said they preferred reducing Medicare benefits and 8 percent preferred cutting Social Security benefits.

While substantial differences existed along political divisions whether taxes should increase, the real news is Americans across both party and philosophical lines show no significant differences from one another in their support of the top two courses of action.

Thirty-nine percent of Republicans, 35 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of independents said the age of eligibility should be raised. Many baby boomers already don't become eligible for full Social Security benefits until age 66. Reduced benefits begin at age 62.

Thirty-nine percent of independents, 38 percent of Democrats and 33 percent of Republicans said people should be encouraged to work past age 65.

No margin of error was provided.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A Malaysia Airlines plane sent signals to a satellite for four hours after the aircraft went missing, an indication that it was still flying for hundreds of miles or more, a U.S. official briefed on the search said Thursday.

Six days after the plane with 239 people aboard disappeared, Malaysian authorities expanded their search westward toward India, saying the aircraft may have flown for several hours after its last contact with the ground shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

A string of previous clues about Flight MH370 have led nowhere.

‘‘MH370 went completely silent over the open ocean,’’ said Malaysia’s acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. ‘‘This is a crisis situation. It is a very complex operation, and it is not obviously easy. We are devoting all our energies to the task at hand.’’

The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the situation by name, said the Boeing 777-200 wasn’t transmitting data to the satellite, but was instead sending out a signal to establish contact.

Boeing offers a satellite service that can receive a stream of data during flight on how the aircraft is functioning and relay the information to the plane’s home base. The idea is to provide information before the plane lands on whether maintenance work or repairs are needed.

Malaysia Airlines didn’t subscribe to that service, but the plane still had the capability to connect with the satellite and was automatically sending pings, the official said.

‘‘It’s like when your cellphone is off but it still sends out a little ‘I'm here’ message to the cellphone network,’’ the official said. ‘‘That’s how sometimes they can triangulate your position even though you’re not calling because the phone every so often sends out a little bleep. That’s sort of what this thing was doing.’’

The plane had enough fuel to fly about four more hours, the U.S. official said.

Boeing did not comment.

Messages involving a different, more rudimentary data service also were received from the airliner for a short time after the plane’s transponder — a device used to identify the plane to radar — went silent, the official said.

If the plane had disintegrated during flight or had suffered some other catastrophic failure, all signals — the pings to the satellite, the data messages and the transponder — would be expected to stop at the same time.

One part of the hunt is in the South China Sea, where the aircraft was seen on civilian radar flying northeast before vanishing without any indication of technical problems. A similar-sized search is also being conducted in the Strait of Malacca because of military radar sightings that might indicate the plane turned in that direction after its last contact, passing over the Malay Peninsula.

The total search area being covered is about 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers) — about the size of Portugal.

Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said: ‘‘Of course. We can’t rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. We are expanding our search into the Andaman Sea.’’ The sea is northwest of the Malay Peninsula.

He said Malaysia was asking for radar data from India and other neighboring countries to see if they can trace it flying northwest. India says its navy, air force and coast guard will search for the plane in the south Andaman Sea.

‘‘Because of new information, we may be part of an effort to open a new search area in the Indian Ocean,’’ White House spokesman Jay Carney said earlier Thursday, declining to offer additional details about that information or the new area.

The U.S. Navy 7th Fleet said it is moving one of its ships, the USS Kidd, into the Strait of Malacca, west of Malaysia.

In the latest disappointment, search planes failed to find any debris from the plane after they were sent Thursday to an area of the South China Sea off the southern tip of Vietnam, where satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects.

‘‘There is nothing. We went there. There is nothing,’’ Hishammuddin said.

More than two-thirds of those on Flight MH370 were from China, which has shown impatience with the absence of any results. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday in Beijing he would like to see better coordination among countries in the search.

The passengers’ ‘‘families and friends are burning with anxiety. The Chinese government and Chinese people are all deeply concerned about their safety,’’ he said at the close of the annual session of the country’s legislature. ‘‘As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will not stop searching for the plane.’’

He said China had eight ships and 10 satellites searching for the plane.

Malaysia has been criticized for its handling of the search, in part because it took several days to fully explain why it couldn’t say whether the plane had turned back. Officials say they are not hiding anything and are searching areas where the plane is most likely to be, while trying to establish its actual location.

Besides the Chinese satellite photos and the so-far fruitless search based on the possible sighting on military radar, there have been other developments in the aviation mystery that have failed to lead to finding the plane or the cause of its disappearance:

— Oil slicks seen Saturday were found to have nothing to do with the jetliner.

— A yellow object spotted by a search plane turned out to be ordinary sea trash.

— Officials initially said four or five passengers checked in for the flight but did not board, fueling speculation about terrorism. Officials later said some people with reservations never checked in and were simply replaced by standby passengers, and no baggage was removed.

— Officials said two men, later identified as Iranians, boarded the plane with stolen passports. It was later reported that they were unlikely to be linked to terrorist groups.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the plane’s disappearance.

Experts say one possibility that could explain why the transponders were not working is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.

Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean, some debris should be floating even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.

Anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles lied about the theft of more than $500 million worth of bitcoin.

According to the hackers, Karpeles still controls all of the cryptocurrency he says was stolen recently in the biggest heist of bitcoin’s brief history. Mt. Gox was the world’s largest bitcoin exchange until about 850,000 bitcoin were allegedly stolen during a breach, forcing the exchange to shut down and file for bankruptcy protection.

According to new claims from anonymous hackers, however, the heist never occurred and Karpeles still controls nearly 1 million bitcoin worth approximately $596 million at Monday’s exchange rate.

According to a report from Forbes, the anonymous hackers took over Karpeles’s blog and published a post supposedly exposing fraud committed by the CEO. The post was also published on Pastebin.

“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] bitcoin community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote. “This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of [our] ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than [we] would have liked to verify the data.”

The hackers’ note was accompanied by a file containing what they claim to be evidence of fraud. They say that they have managed to obtain various personal data belonging to Karpeles, including what they claim to be evidence that Mt. Gox’s current bitcoin balance is in fact 951,116, which would mean that the 850,000 bitcoin the exchange claimed was stolen is still in its control.

As Forbes noted, however, the evidence may in fact simply reveal remarkably poor accounting practices at Mt. Gox, a former hub for trading “Magic: The Gathering” cards, rather than fraud.###95||Empty###96||Empty###97||Stocks recovered off their worst levels to end narrowly mixed as worries over the global implications of a slowing Chinese economy dampened demand for risky assets, luring investors instead into the safety of the U.S. government bond market.

After Hours Stock News From Midnight Trader.



Copyright © 2014 MT Newswires, a Division of MidnightTrader, Inc.###98||News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services###99||Economists and investors will continue to keep a nervous eye on Ukraine this week following Sunday's vote by Crimeans to join the Russian Federation, an event sure to escalate tensions between Russia and the West.

Also this week, South Africa will release last month's inflation and retail sales figures, the US Federal Reserve will hold a two-day policy meeting and UK chancellor George Osborne will present his latest budget. Here is your guide.

Africa

Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) will release February's consumer price index (CPI) readings on Wednesday. The country's annual inflation rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive month in January to 5.8% – just below the upper-end of the South African Reserve Bank's 3% to 6% target band – but probably remained unchanged last month.

Also on Wednesday, Stats SA will report January's retail sales figures.

Analysts expect the release to show that sales rose 4.9% from a year earlier in the first month of 2014, an improvement on December's 3.5% year on year rise.

Stats SA will report January's civil cases for debt, wholesale and motor trade figures along with building stats on Thursday. Friday will bring the fourth quarter credit bureau monitor from the National Consumer Regulator and February's Spark ATM Cash Index.

Elsewhere on the continent, Nigeria – Africa's largest oil producer – will release February's consumer inflation readings on Monday. Producer price figures will follow from Ghana on Wednesday. And Morocco's February CPI will be released on Friday. Zimbabwe may also report February's CPI sometime over the coming days.

Beyond these price reports, economists and investors will also be on the lookout for Kenya's fourth quarter gross domestic product figures and an interest rates decision in Morocco this week.

United States

The Federal Reserve's policy setting arm – the Federal Open Markets Committee – will begin a two-day gathering on Tuesday. This week's meeting is the first with Janet Yellen – Ben Bernanke's successor – as chair. No major policy announcements are expected, but some analysts are hoping that the central bank may provide greater clarity on future plans in the committee's post-meeting statement or chair's press conference.

Officials are widely expected to leave rates on hold at current levels until around the middle of next year. Consensus is that policymakers will also continue to gradually scale back the size of the Fed's asset purchase programme on Wednesday. Analysts expect the Fed to reduce monthly securities buying by another $10-billion to $55-billion.

Beyond the Fed, economists and investors will be on the lookout for a few closely-followed data releases over the coming days. Most notably, January's industrial production figures will be released on Monday. Last month's CPI and housing stats will follow on Tuesday.

Later in the week, attention will shift to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's closely-followed regional manufacturing gauge and February's existing home sales data on Thursday.

Tuesday's housing figures are expected to show that the pace of new home construction rose to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 910 000 units in February from 880 000 units in January. Permits for new construction likely rose as well. Consensus is that Thursday's existing homes sales data will show that sales slowed further, albeit only slightly, in February as limited supply, rising prices and mortgage rates continued to take their toll.

Europe

Markets will continue to monitor developments in Ukraine this week after residents of the Crimea region of the country voted on Sunday to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation following its recent invasion.

Russia recently used its veto power as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to block a resolution calling the referendum illegitimate and illegal and calling on states not to recognise its results. But the United States and European Union have continued to make it clear that the vote will not be recognised.

The United States has already imposed sanction on some Ukrainian separatists and Russian officials and European Union officials, at a meeting on Monday, are widely expected to extend sanctions against Russia, including asset freezes and travel bans against certain officials. The Russian Parliament, for its part, is scheduled to debate a proposal for Crimea to join Russia on Friday.

Beyond events in Ukraine, economists and investors will be scrutinising a few key data releases scheduled over the coming days, including Europe's final February inflation figures on Tuesday. Expectations are that February's inflation rate may be revised downward to 0.7%, year on year, largely as a result of low energy prices. Germany's closely followed Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung economic sentiment indices will also be released on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, George Osborne – the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer – will present government's budget for the 2014/15 fiscal year alongside the Office for Budget Responsibility's biannual economic and fiscal outlook. Few are expecting major policy changes, but will be paying close attention to revised growth and fiscal forecasts.

Asia

Japan's latest trade figures are the big item on an otherwise sparse Asian data diary this week. Japan's ministry of finance will release last month's trade tallies on Thursday.

Economists surveyed by Market News International expect the figures to show that the world's number three economy posted a 20th consecutive monthly deficit in February, but that the gap narrowed significantly from January's record deficit of ¥2.79-trillion. Japan's large trade deficit contributed to lower than expected economic expansion of just 1% in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Officials at the Bank of Japan – the country's central bank – have called January's figure anomalous. A combination of temporary factors – such as North America's harsh weather, the Chinese Spring Festival and strong domestic demand in advance of an impending sales tax hike scheduled for April – all combined to suppress export volumes. An uptick in overseas demand for automobiles and plastics, in particular, probably drove overall export volumes upwards last month.

The median forecast is that Japan's exports rose 12.6% from a year earlier in February – up from a hugely disappointing 9.5% year-on-year rise in January – and that import volumes rose 7.5% – down from a 25.1% rise in January – shrinking last month's trade gap to ¥600.9-billion. If the consensus proves accurate, this would be the country's smallest trade deficit since June of last year.###100||



The national pizza chain Sbarro -- which has locations in shopping malls and outlet centers in Birmingham, Huntsville and Florence -- has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years, Reuters news service reported earlier today.

Sbarro is struggling with too much debt and with fewer customers in the malls that house many of its restaurants, according to the Reuters report.

Under a "pre-packaged" Chapter 11 reorganization, the Melville, N.Y.-based company should make a "quick exit" from bankruptcy before May 7, the company said today, according to Reuters.

Founded in 1956, Sbarro has tried to increase sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor other fast-casual restaurant chains, Reuters reported.

An "unprecedented decline in mall traffic" and an "unsustainable" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, Sbarro chief financial officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing.

Sbarro has locations at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, at the Outlet Shops of Grand River in Leeds, at Parkway Place in Huntsville and at Regency Square Mall in Florence, according to the company's website.

It is not yet known how Sbarro's bankruptcy will affect those locations, but according to Reuters, the company said it recently closed more than 180 restaurants, and expects to close about 50 more. The bankruptcy will not affect 582 locations that are owned by franchisees.

UPDATED at 3:17 CDT on Monday, March 10, 2014 to correct that Sbarro does not have a location in Mobile and to add that Regency Square Mall is in Florence.

After an extended chase that included overtures on both sides and flirtations with other parties, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will combine to create the nation's fourth-largest menswear retail chain.

Men's Wearhouse Inc. said Tuesday that it's buying its rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. for $1.8 billion (all figures US). The company will pay $65 a share, a 5 per cent premium to Jos. A. Bank's Monday closing price of $61.83. Jos. A. Bank also said it's terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear.

On Tuesday, shares of both companies rose on the news: Men's Wearhouse's stock was up nearly 5 per cent to $57.14, while shares of Jos. A. Bank increased nearly 4 per cent to $64.22.

The acquisition comes after months of the two chains publicly fighting over who would acquire whom. Industry watchers had speculated that a merger was inevitable given the challenges the companies face in the competitive menswear landscape. With more than 1,700 U.S. stores and $3.5 billion in annual sales, the combined company's reach in men's clothing will fall behind only Macy's, Kohl's and J.C. Penney.

"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth," Doug Ewert, CEO of Men's Wearhouse, said in a statement.

Jos. A. Bank made the first move in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion. Men's Wearhouse shot down that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion. But after Jos. A. Bank turned down that bid, Men's Wearhouse increased its offer to $1.6 billion, and then again to $1.78 billion.

In the middle of the back-and forth, Jos. A. Bank said last month that it was buying Everest Holdings LLC, the parent company of Eddie Bauer. But the company left the door open for a deal with Men's Wearhouse by saying if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.

By early March, Men's Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 a share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 a share if some conditions were met. Then, a few days later, the companies announced they were exchanging certain confidential information with each other.

Despite the rough courting period, both companies say they expect a smooth integration. In a joint news release, they said shareholders of both companies will benefit from about $100 million to $150 million in savings realized over three years as the company streamlines its duplicative corporate functions and improves sourcing and merchandising.###103||An open letter to Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill:



In 2009, we exchanged correspondence regarding my concerns with various aspects of the proposed Affordable Care Act.

An open letter to Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill:

In 2009, we exchanged correspondence regarding my concerns with various aspects of the proposed Affordable Care Act. I wish to say you were quite gracious and charitable at all times, and I truly believe you were sincere in your responses — including the report you so proudly presented that contained the statement, “Congress will preserve your ability to choose your health insurance plan, your doctor, and your hospital.”

I wish to detail for you, Senator, how your efforts have impacted this particular constituent. Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, my health insurance premiums increased; albeit nominally to date, but an increase nevertheless.

My prescription medication program also increased, raising the annual deductible from $250 to $2,500 by discontinuing the separate prescription program entirely, lumping and combining it with general medical coverage. BCBS is the insurance provider supplied by my employer, not exactly one of the “inferior” carriers or policies for that matter, which you so loathed and decided to legislate out of existence. But what I consider to be most abhorrent is the horrendous increase in costs for prescription meds.

I am not a physician, but I do wish to inform you that some people’s health and, in some instances very life, is contingent upon prescription medication. My wife suffers from an extreme condition of fibromyalgia, coupled with osteoarthritis. After five years of trial and error, her doctor determined the proper strength and dosage of medication needed to control her pain and quality of life.

She currently is prescribed nine different meds taken daily. But allow me the time to highlight just one. In December 2013, we were paying $84.56 for a monthly prescription of Lyrica. In January, the cost for this medicine alone jumped to $370.06. I have obtained quotations from various pharmacies and have found none that are less expensive than the pharmacy we normally use. Our monthly out-of-pocket expenditures for prescription meds prior to Jan. 1 was approximately $150. It is now in excess of $600 per month!

We cannot afford this. Who can? And all answers to my inquiries regarding the reason for these increases in cost have been unanimous — the new mandates of the Affordable Care Act.

So now, Senator, thanks to your pursuits to reform healthcare, my wife has been forced to stop taking her physician-prescribed medication.

You keep emphasizing accessibility to healthcare. All Americans had that prior to Jan. 1, 2014. Accessibility is not the most important aspect of healthcare, affordability is. If you can’t afford it then accessibility means nothing.

The turmoil in our lives is attributed completely and totally to the Affordable Care Act, and your support for it. It is difficult not to take it personally when I see my wife spend her day sitting in her chair, weeping and writhing from the pain she now endures, capable of only the smallest of tasks.

Affordability is actually an integral ingredient of the formula for accessibility, which we had prior to Jan. 1, 2014 — and now no longer have.

I simply do not understand this “transfer of health” that is currently transpiring. Yes, I agree with you, as a majority of Missourians do, it was unconscionable there were fellow Americans without health insurance, but to take it away wholesale from those who did merely to then shift it to those who didn’t seems to defy logic and common sense. It’s still a zero-sum game.

The travesty of the Affordable Care Act, and your involvement with it becoming law, is the deceitful pretense of the stated purpose — to provide a benefit for those without healthcare. To accomplish this upon the backs of our young people and families just beginning their adult lives, and to further burden the sickliest and infirmed among us, is deplorable beyond explanation.

I am not acquainted with anyone in my community who would ever entertain the thought of helping another person by harming someone else in order to do so. It is the epitome of elitist arrogance to purport that you know best who is, and who is not, to receive the medication and/or treatment prescribed by their doctor.

Please provide an explanation to my wife why she must now suffer so that others can have relief, especially since her relief was already attained and realized only to be taken away.

Eighteen states currently have recall provisions for their federal legislators. I would like to see Missouri become the 19th. I have contacted my state representatives and requested that they give thought to introducing some type of recall measure that would allow the people of this state to dismiss those we send to Washington and replace them. The actual prospects of a possible recall may well give a serving U.S. senator or representative a reason to temper their vote and influence with the better interests of Missouri in mind, rather than the will of a national political party. It is not my intent to disparage you or your office, which I absolutely know you occupy with a great sense of responsibility and character.

The issue at hand is that the state of Missouri seems to have no statutory recourse available to its citizens regarding an elected federal official that has become a danger or threat to their welfare and/or well-being, other than trying to survive and persevere through the remainder of their term and await the next election. I have witnessed and experienced enough misery in these first two months of 2014 that we, as citizens of Missouri, must do what we can to strengthen the political will and leverage of its common inhabitants. We must obtain the tools and mechanisms whereby we can assure protection and freedom from those chosen among us that would ignore and neglect the wishes of this state in order to satisfy the desires or demands of a political party.

Or, we can continue to remain helpless as our unique way of life in Missouri continues to be assaulted and eroded.

The IPO , which could well exceed US$100 billion, is expected to rank as the biggest of the year, exceeding Facebook's IPO of US$104 billion, according to a 36kr.com on Sunday.

The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, regulator of the city's stock exchange, had turned away the potentially record-breaking IPO by red-lighting Alibaba's proposition of a "partnership system" for its share structure, designed to retain founder and former CEO Jack Ma's control over the company.

"The Hong Kong market today needs time to research on and digest the administrative structural renovation of a startup company," said Alibaba's current CEO Lu Zhaoxi during an event in 2013. "We decided not to go public in Hong Kong."

Meanwhile, Alibaba said that the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have both showed support for an IPO in the U.S. , and both have confirmed in writing that the "partnership system" was in accordance with American regulations.

"Alibaba decided to commence the process of going public in the U.S. today, it not only makes the company more transparent and international, but realizes the company’s long-term vision and goal," the company said in an announcement.

According to the report, the higher level management, including Jack Ma, holds 10 percent of the company's shares, while Yahoo and the Japanese-owned SoftBank Corp hold 24 and 36 percent respectively.###105||Empty###106||###107||Read more in Special Coverage:



China and the United States should expand common interests while respecting each other's core interests and major concerns and properly managing differences to raise the level of bilateral relationship, Premier Li Keqiang said hin Beijing Thursday.The Sino-US relationship is in essence the one between the largest developing country and the largest developed country in the world, Li told a press conference after the conclusion of the annual legislative session.Last year, President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama had a meeting in California and reached consensus of building a new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States.The new model of relationship has a defining feature of non-conflict and win-win cooperation, Li said.Due to different historical and cultural backgrounds and development stages, it is natural for the two countries to have some differences on certain matters and frictions in cooperation, but these are just "pains" amid growing cooperation, Li said."As long as the two sides respect each other's core interests and major concerns, properly manage their differences and engage in equal consultations, and in particular, continue to expand their common interests, the two countries will be able to further raise the level of their relationship," said Li.The common interests between China and the United States far outweigh their differences, said Li, adding the volume of bilateral trade registered over 520 billion US dollars last year."There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of Sino-US cooperation. We need to make the most of our complementarity," said Li."The wise people will seek their common interests, while the unwise ones will focus on their differences," said Li,citing a Chinese saying.Whatever change may take place, it should be conducive to both countries and the sound and steady development of Sino-US ties, said Li."China and the US need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said.###108||On Tuesday, interest rates improved on several mortgage loans at Pittsburgh-headquartered lender, PNC Bank (NYSE:PNC).

Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a security lapse, hackers hit the personal blog of Bitcoin exchange's chief executive to level charges of fraud.

The Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, MagicalTux.net, were hijacked Sunday and defaced with a post that alleged the exchange kept some of the coins allegedly stolen in fraudulent withdrawals. Hackers also posted a 716MB Zip file that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox servers on the sites as well as to Pastebin.

The data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.

"First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles," hackers wrote. "It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed." The phrase "getting Goxed" has become synonymous with the frustration felt by many Mt. Gox investors, who have suffered frequent outages, delayed trading, and suspended withdrawals.

"Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data," the hackers wrote their profanity-laced diatribe. "No user database dumps have been included."

CNET could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims, but some Reddit users said they were able to confirm that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, which was posted in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.

CNET has contacted Mt. Gox for comment and will update this report when we learn more.

At its height, Mt. Gox was one of the largest and most popular Bitcoin exchanges. However, the troubled exchange suspended customer withdrawals on February 7, claiming a fundamental flaw existed in Bitcoin that affected all transactions. Mt. Gox later apologized for the issue and said it had developed a workaround that would allow it to resume service, but that has not yet happened.

Due to the currency's encryption technology, it might be difficult, if not impossible, for the stolen bitcoins to be restored to their owners' accounts, leaving people across the globe with significant losses.###111||ROME (Reuters) - Italy's defence ministry on Tuesday said that no Italian military vessels were near to where a Libyan military spokesman earlier said Italian ships had helped Libya's navy secure a fleeing oil tanker, a spokeswoman said.

"There were no Italian military vessels in the area," a ministry spokeswoman told Reuters.

A tanker that loaded oil at a rebel-held port in the east of the country escaped the Libyan navy earlier in the day, leading to the ouster of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan. A Libyan military spokeswoman later said the tanker had been fired on, damaged and secured with the help of "Italian vessels".

(Reporting by Steve Scherer)###112||NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The bitcoin exchange Mt.

"Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users," the exchange said on its website. Mt. Gox on Feb. 28 filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed it had lost thousands of its customers bitcoins. Mt.

The reason for the move, Alibaba said, was to “make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.”

Whether it will pick Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange is still to be determined.

The public offering could be one of the biggest ever in the U.S., with some estimates putting its valuation at a hefty $130 billion, raising $16 billion. That’s obviously good news for Yahoo, which holds a 24 percent stake in Alibaba.

In fact, Alibaba’s success has already been a boon to the Silicon Valley Internet giant, boosting its shares hugely, even as its core business has languished. But who needs a U.S. turnaround when Alibaba execs are doing all the work for you?

Interestingly, sources close to the company said Yahoo will be among the few sellers in the offering — it is compelled to unload slightly less than half its shares by a previous agreement. Some think the lack of equity available to new investors could spike the price even higher.

Those sources also added that while some think Alibaba could go public by summer, it could delay the offering until the early fall. That means that a filing will come around late March or April.

Whatever the timing, the IPO will also set off a feeding frenzy on Wall Street, as the big investment banks vie for a piece of the action. (Hey boys, I’ve known Alibaba bigs Jack Ma and Joe Tsai for years, but I am not going to introduce you, even if you ask nice!)

In China, of course, the news is of Alibaba’s abandonment of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, a move that came after it declined to accept the company’s partnership set-up that gives much of the power over Alibaba to a group of insiders. (In New York, of course, they can do as they dang well please!)

Perhaps as a way to assuage hurt feelings, Alibaba said in its statement that it might consider also listing in China later.

“Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China,” Alibaba said.###115||Source: Reuters

SHANGHAI, China — Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.

In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.

China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd, is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.

An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.

"In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organizational ability also has a hold over how a person shops," said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.

Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.

Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.

Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week.

PEELING AWAY

Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.

Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.

"We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall," said Wang.

Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.

"As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers," Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. "We go and sell our products where the consumers are."

RIVALS RISING

Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.

JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.

Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in "the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.

As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.

"I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster," said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. "It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."

Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.

Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.

Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.

MA VS MA

Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.

When Tencent launched a "red envelope" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a "Pearl Harbour attack" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.

Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.

WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a "killer weapon" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.

China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.

"The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector," said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.

"Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming," said Zhang.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise — the highest total since 1956. While the number of national vehicle miles traveled on roads increased 0.3 percent, public transportation use in 2013 increased by 1.1 percent, according to the study.

“As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,” Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of the Grand Rapids’ transit authority in Michigan, said in a press release.

“Public transportation systems nationwide — in small, medium, and large communities — saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers.”

Expanding bus and train networks and increased service helped spur the growth, as did the nation's urban shift, the report found. Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent, outpacing both population growth and the number of vehicle miles traveled on roads.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities,” said Michael Melaniphy, APTA president. "People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, he added. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."

The economic recovery is another driver behind the increase in transit ridership. Nearly 60 percent of trips taken on public transportation in 2013 were for work commutes, the study found.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, the numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

Heavy rail (subways and elevated trains) ridership saw the biggest jump with 2.8 percent nationally in 2013. Increased service during peak hours in Miami accounted for the bulk of the jump, increasing local usage by 10.6 percent. Commuter rails also became more popular as ridership increased 2.1 percent nationally. A new rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, which opened in 2012, registered more than double the number of passengers compared to last year. Light rail systems, such as modern streetcars, trolleys and heritage trolleys, usage increased 1.6 percent, according to the study.

Nationally, bus ridership remained stable, declining by 0.1 percent. But in cities with a population of below 100,000, the number of passengers increased by 3.8 percent.

Demand-response ridership, a flexible mode of public transit that doesn’t follow fixed routes or schedules, such as shared taxi or minibuses that pickup and deposit passengers along the way, increased by 0.5 percent in 2013.

Overall, the sprawling city of Houston had a large ridership gain. So did Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."

Generating significant cash flow and a more efficient capital structure: With the full benefit of the anticipated synergies, the combined company would have had an aggregate EBITDA in 2013 of approximately $214 million on a pro forma basis, implying pro forma combined synergy adjusted Net Debt to EBITDA of 2.7 times.3 Moving forward, the combined company will also have the potential for further reductions in leverage.

Expanding sourcing ability in key production areas: With more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America , the combined company is expected to be able to more efficiently manage its sourcing portfolio.

Commitment to shared purpose and sustainability: ChiquitaFyffes will continue its environmental and social responsibility commitments, including adding additional organic, Fairtrade, GlobalGAP and Rainforest Alliance certified capacity.

Relates Articles:###126||A snapshot of Obamacare enrollment in seven states suggests the law hasn’t significantly increased competition in health insurance markets, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported.

In California, for example, four big insurers have largely carved up the state’s market. The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California’s insurance market is now “moderately concentrated” instead of “highly concentrated,” according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit that focuses on health care.

“There are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,” Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said in a phone interview.

About 5 million Americans have signed up for private health plans through today using the law’s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.

In California, WellPoint Inc.’s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state’s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state’s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.

State Changes

WellPoint also lost ground in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent. In Connecticut, WellPoint’s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.

Kristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.

Before the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minnesota, has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state’s exchange, MNsure.

Before the health law, the state’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.

The Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering “some of the lowest exchange premiums in the country” for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.###127||Empty###128||Empty###129||Empty###130||Empty###131||A "well-known" U.S. billionaire has purchased the most expensive single-life-insurance policy in the world, according to Guinness World Records.

The life insurance policy the billionaire purchased is valued at $201 million.

Guinness World Records didn't reveal the billionaire's identity, but they did provide a couple clues.

The billionaire lives in Silicon Valley and they're "actively known in the technology space." (That still doesn't really narrow it down.)

The record-breaking life insurance policy was sold by Dovi Frances, a managing partner of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC-a firm that advises high-networth clients on their complex financial needs.

Putting together the policy required over two dozen insurance companies, he said in a statement.

"Bringing this transaction together required negotiating concurrently with over two dozen insurance companies and complex underwriting requests from each insurance company."

The previous record holding life insurance policy was $100 million.###132||Why did this happen?

Despite these fears, factory output still grew for the first two months – taken as a whole, up 8.6% – admittedly the weakest since 2009 and down from 9.7% in December, but still strongly positive. Retail sales were also slower, down form 13.6% in December, but at 11.8% still relatively strong.

Worries persist, though, as PMI numbers remain below 50, suggesting anticipation of contraction in growth. January was at 49.5 and February at 48.5, the third straight monthly fall.

Bet On or Short China?

Chinese growth and future metals demand may not be the solid bet it was a couple of years ago, but the market can’t say it didn’t see this coming.

FREE Download: The Monthly MMI® Report – price trends for 10 metal markets.

The reaction in terms of prices for commodities and equities is probably going to be overdone, but probably still has some way to run. So far, price falls have been more to do with investor sentiment; inventory hasn’t been liquidated en masse, nor have re-exports emerged as a significant force – if they were to do so, prices could fall further.

But it wouldn’t take much of a shift by the PBOC and an uptick in metal off-take as the traditionally stronger copper buying season starts next quarter for sentiment to stabilize, at least for copper. Some European consumers are not taking the risk, taking advantage of the strongest Euro-Dollar exchange rate for 2.1/2 years and dollar copper prices down to $6,400 per metric ton some automotive and industrial consumers in Europe are in the process of locking in prices through 2017 and even 2018 according to Reuters.

Iron ore is another matter. Steel production is under pressure from a number of quarters – financial constraints on bank lending, pollution policy by Beijing and not least a weak finished steel market. Where all that inventory is going to go is harder to see; there isn’t a ready re-export market for it, so it is likely to depress future demand for many months to come.

Not surprisingly, prices have fallen and could well fall further. Australian producers remain profitable at prices well below current levels, but domestic Chinese producers will be struggling at current numbers. Possibly the work-down of inventory will be accompanied more by pain among domestic suppliers than overseas.

Analysts reckon that Alibaba could seek to raise up to $15 billion (£9bn) through the share sale in a move which could value it at between $150 billion and $200 billion. Details of the float may come as early as April.

At the top end, that would make Alibaba the world’s second most valuable internet company after Google, which is valued at $394 billion. Amazon and Facebook both have stock market values of $172bn.

Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma and 17 friends in 1999, when it offered just 22 items on its website. It has grown to dominate Chinese e-commerce and Mr Ma’s wealth is estimated at $11.4 billion. The firm employs more than 20,000 and is said to account for 70 per cent of all packages delivered in China.

The firm has not decided whether to float on the New York Stock Exchange or its more tech-heavy rival Nasdaq, but it has ruled out Hong Kong.

“Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,” the company said yesterday. “This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.”

More than $150 billion-worth of merchandise changes hands on Alibaba’s different online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay put together.

The firm has nine major websites, which include consumers selling to consumers, businesses selling to consumers and to each other, global and domestic selling platforms, cloud computing and an electronic payment system.

China is second only to India in the number of internet users it has at 618 million.

McKinsey & Co has forecast its internet retail market will treble in size between 2011 and 2015 to $395 billion.

In its latest figures, for the three months to September 2013, Alibaba’s quarter-on-quarter profits grew by 12 per cent to $792 million on revenues up by 51 per cent at $1.78 billion. In the same quarter Facebook’s profit was $422 million.###135||Men’s Wearhouse Inc. has agreed to buy smaller rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. for about $1.8 billion in cash, ending a five-month takeover battle between the two menswear retailers.

Both companies’ boards have approved the transaction, the retailers said today in a statement. Jos. A. Bank also will terminate a separate deal to buy the Eddie Bauer brand and cancel a plan to buy as much as $300 million of its own stock.

Today’s agreement settles a feud Jos. A. Bank began in October with an offer for its larger rival. Men’s Wearhouse turned down that proposal and countered with multiple bids for Jos. A. Bank, all of which were rejected as too low. Jos. A. Bank said it would begin talks with Men’s Wearhouse last month following a sweetened $1.78 billion offer.

"It’s a strong acquisition that is mutually beneficial to both companies and shareholders of both companies," Mark Montagna, a Nashville, Tenn.-based analyst for Avondale Partners, said in a phone interview.

The combined company will have more than 1,700 U.S. stores and sales of about $3.5 billion on a pro forma basis, the retailers said. Jos. A. Bank can benefit from Men’s Wearhouse’s tuxedo-rental business, while Men’s Wearhouse can learn from Jos. A. Bank’s ability to inexpensively source products, Montagna said.

Jos. A. Bank imperiled the possibility of a tie-up with Men’s Wearhouse in February, when it agreed to buy the Eddie Bauer brand in an $825 million deal that would have created a company too big for its suitor to acquire.

The deal with Men’s Wearhouse will result in as much as $150 million of annual savings realized over three years, the companies said today. Jos. A. Bank’s approximately 600 stores won’t be rebranded, the companies said.

Jos. A. Bank had been told by five of its largest shareholders to start talking to its rival about a sale, people with knowledge of the matter said in January.

Eminence Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that owns shares in both companies, supported the most recent bid. Eminence Chief Executive Officer Ricky Sandler said in February that the offer represented "a superior alternative" for shareholders over the Eddie Bauer deal.

The $65-a-share purchase price is 56 percent higher than Jos. A. Bank’s closing price on Oct. 8, the day before its offer for Men’s Wearhouse was publicly disclosed.

Men’s Wearhouse had sued Jos. A. Bank, saying it was "economically irrational" for its rival to use the Eddie Bauer deal to fend off a merger. Men’s Wearhouse also accused Jos. A. Bank directors of breaching their fiduciary duties by enacting a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, to make it more difficult for an acquirer to buy the company.

Golden Gate Capital Corp., the San Francisco-based private-equity firm that was selling Eddie Bauer, said it respects Jos. A. Bank’s decision to terminate the deal and is pleased to continue owning the brand.###136||By Candice Choi

NEW YORK — Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which raises the question — how often do people tip their baristas?

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company’s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don’t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn’t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them”

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there’s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke said. At the drive-thru location where she works, for instance, she said tips go down when it’s cold out and people are less likely to reach out and put money in the tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview. There are no plans to bring the mobile tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn’t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they’ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.###137||By Feras Bosalum and Ulf Laessing

TRIPOLI, March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. special forces have seized a commercial tanker that fled with a cargo of oil from a Libyan port controlled by anti-government rebels, halting their attempt to sell petroleum on the global market.

Libyan federalist gunmen demanding regional autonomy and a share of oil wealth managed to load crude onto the ship, which escaped Libya's navy, embarrassing Tripoli's government and prompting parliament to sack the prime minister.

U.S. Navy commandos stormed the Morning Glory tanker as it sat in international waters off Cyprus on Sunday night and took control of the vessel, which the Pentagon said had been held by three armed Libyans.

The standoff over control of OPEC member Libya's oil illustrates how fragile the North African nation's stability remains since the NATO-backed civil war that led to the fall of Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.

With its army still nascent, a weak government has been unable to impose its will on former anti-Gaddafi fighters and militias who now use their military muscle to make demands on the state, often by targeting the vital oil sector.

At least in the short term, the tanker's seizure by U.S. forces is likely to prevent any more attempted oil sales by the rebels, who in August took control of three export terminals accounting previously for 700,000 barrels a day of exports.

"Oil is the economy's artery. The government will not allow anyone to fool around with the assets and resources of the Libyan people," the Libyan government said in a statement.

No one was hurt in the tanker raid, which was approved by U.S. President Barack Obama and requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained" from the Libyan port of Es Sider, his statement said.

It was the second time in six months that U.S. forces have become involved in Libya. A commando team snatched a suspected al Qaeda member off the street as he returned home from prayers in the capital Tripoli in September.

The Cypriot foreign ministry said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a U.S. military escort. It was parked 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Cyprus when the operation occurred around midnight Cyprus time.

The Morning Glory had been North Korean-flagged, but the government in Pyongyang on Thursday said it had notified Libya and maritime authorities that it had severed all ties with the ship because of the vessel's contraband cargo.

There was no immediate reaction from the federalist rebels, based in eastern Libya.

Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said on Saturday his group was ready to negotiate an end to the port blockade, but the government needed to abandon plans to mount a military offensive.

Libya's parliament head, who has quasi-presidential powers, had given the rebels two weeks to withdraw from the seized ports or face a military operation.

But analysts said it was uncertain whether government troops would be able effectively to confront the heavily armed rebels, made up of soldiers who defected from an oil protection force.

BOOST FOR LIBYA GOVT

The tanker's escape highlighted the weakness of government forces, which had claimed several times that the 37,000-tonne ship was under their control only for the vessel to slip into international waters after a firefight.

Still, the intervention by U.S. forces gives a boost to the fragile Libyan government in its fight to impose order on the vast North African state, whose transition to democracy has been upset by tribal, regional and political disputes.

Western powers, worried that the country might fracture or slide deeper into chaos, have been training Libyan armed forces and cajoling conflicting parties in government to reach a settlement, with little progress so far.

A successful sale of Libyan oil outside government control, though, was always going to be complicated for the rebels.

A Cypriot police source said three men - described as two Israelis and a Senegalese - were detained for questioning on Saturday on suspicion of attempting to buy the tanker's cargo, but were freed after a court refused to issue an arrest warrant.

Two of the men carried diplomatic passports - one from Senegal and one from a central African country, the security source said.

The source said they flew a Lear Jet into Cyprus on Friday evening, chartered a vessel from a yachting marina in Larnaca and headed to the tanker.

"They spoke to somebody on board the vessel, then left. At Larnaca marina police called them in for questioning," the source said. The men left for Tel Aviv after being freed.

FULL CONFRONTATION UNLIKELY

The Libyan navy did open fire on a Maltese-flagged tanker trying to approach Es Sider in January, but analysts say a full military confrontation with the port rebels would be unlikely.

Any bloodshed would complicate efforts to negotiate a settlement with rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran, a former anti-Gaddafi commander who was in charge of protecting oilfields and ports until he turned against the government in the summer.

His campaign to seek more rights for Libya's underdeveloped east has won him some sympathy, but many people dismiss him as a tribal warlord with no political vision.

Any military conflict might boost his popularity and plans to establish a federalist state sharing power and oil wealth like under King Idris, who was toppled by Gaddafi in a 1969 plot.

The government fears federalism might open the door for secession and similar protests by other regions though the rebels say they do not want to break up Libya.

Libya's government faces a budget crisis as oil production has fallen to little over 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 1.4 million bpd in summer when a wave of protests at oilfields and ports started. Oil is the main source of revenues for the budget and to fund basic food imports.

But others are no doubt considering looking elsewhere, especially as it becomes more apparent that GM took great lengths to avoid this recall for seven or eight years. In an effort to placate the former group and hold on to the latter, GM is offering $500 credit toward the purchase of a new GM vehicle.

According to court documents, GM bought back at least 13 problematic Chevy Cobalts in the years before it eventually announced the recall in 2014. Some had hoped the automaker would undertake a much larger buyback program in light of revelations about the delay in issuing the recall, but the Detroit News says a March 5 note to GM dealers makes it clear that “General Motors is not offering repurchase as a remedy.”

Instead, affected consumers can get a $500 refund with the “purchase or lease a new 2013/2014/2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac.”

A rep for GM, which is currently being probed by federal authorities over discrepancies in its recall times, says that the $500 offer is “In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall… We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM, nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance.”

The letter to dealers says this “special cash allowance is effective through April 30.”

There have been at least a dozen deaths associated with the defect, in which vehicles’ ignition switches suddenly revert to the “off” position, causing the vehicle to stall and disabling important systems like airbags. The recall now involves more than a million vehicles, including 2005-07 Cobalts, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and the 2007 Saturn Sky.###139||"As long as you can meet the listing requirements of the Hong Kong stock exchange, you should definitely go there."

That was the clear message from one of the most senior stock market regulators on the mainland when asked about the funding needs of small-sized, capital-hungry private enterprises.

During the once-a-year political summit in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the mainland's stock market watchdog may simply abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the CSRC. This will make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the foreseeable future.

The trick to getting any company listed is secure so-called cornerstone investors

Yao's comment is certainly good news for mainland firms fighting the nationwide economic downturn, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a 15-month suspension of domestic listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen where the mainland's two national bourses are based. But is this really good news for Hong Kong?

The Hong Kong stock exchange may welcome the move as more IPOs from the north could strengthen the city's position as a global capital-raising centre - it was the world's No2 destination for IPOs in terms of total amount raised last year. The New York stock exchange was in first place.

Investment bankers will also welcome the move for sure. The more IPOs, the more fees they get, and that also means bigger bonuses. However, let's consider the quality of the IPOs rather than the quantity.

Last week in Beijing Yao encouraged the nation's small and medium-sized private enterprises to first consider Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen, for listing partly because of the widely accepted assumption in the financial industry that small firms have an easier time raising money here than on the mainland.

He also indicated that large state-owned enterprises, although they have the freedom to come to Hong Kong for IPOs, should still consider domestic listings as their first choice. Fund managers say Yao's comments are in line with Beijing's long-term stance that quality blue-chip companies should list domestically so mainland investors can first share in their business success, and perhaps enjoy fat dividends as well.

Then what about Hong Kong? By welcoming these smaller firms from the north, which may find it hard to raise money at home, are we turning the Hong Kong stock market into a rubbish bin, or are we just Plan B for those who cannot list at home.

The trick to getting any company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days; just secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half your IPO shares. That's why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's IPO market looks more like a series of private placements these days.

An IPO should be a new beginning, not the end, for any responsible, listed company. You come to Hong Kong not to raise money easily here, but because you are committed to the stock market and your public shareholders.

LONDON -- Vodafone, one of the world's largest telecommunications company, agreed Monday to buy Spain's Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) as it seeks to expand operations in its primary European market.

Grupo Corporativo Ono S.A. provides phone, mobile and television services to 1.9 million customers and has the largest "next-generation network" in Spain, reaching 7.2 million homes, or 41 per cent of the country. Vodafone says Ono has abundant spare capacity, giving it space to expand.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction - together with our fiber-to-the-home build program - will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market," Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said in a statement.

Vodafone is flush with cash after agreeing last year to sell its stake in a U.S. venture to Verizon for $130 billion in cash and stock -- one of the biggest deals in corporate history.

Monday's deal marks Vodafone's second major acquisition in Europe, after its purchase of Kabel Deutschland last year. Vodafone was attracted by Kabel Deutschland's extensive cable network, which it could use to expand its fixed-line, broadband and television business.

The deal allows Vodafone to accelerate its expansion in Europe, and to take advantage of the rapid increase in the adoption of unified communications products and services in the Spanish market. Ono has invested approximately 7 billion euros in its network since 1998.###142||The Quiznos bankruptcy is another sign of the times, pointing out how the US recession has been squeezing small businesses during these hard times.

In a related report by The Inquisitr, small businesses like Papa Johns and Quiznos were afraid of the impact Obamacaer may have on their ability to stay afloat. Before the launch of the Affordable Care Act it was estimated the cost to local business owners would be up to $30,000 per year. At the time, Quiznos owner Randall Tabor said, “I don’t have the profit margin to pay for it.”

Over the last several years there has been a developing trend in the small business world. Eateries and restaurants that focus on being affordable or cheap are doing well. High end restaurants are also doing very well because the rich have seen their money bounce back after the calamitous downfall in 2008. But it’s businesses like Quiznos which have been caught in the middle and are facing bankruptcy.

According to Bob Goldin, executive vice president at Chicago-based restaurant researcher Technomic Inc., in relation to Quiznos Panera Bread represented the high end and Subway the low:

“They expanded too fast, they had a weak franchisee network. Once the Paneras of the world came along, I think, many consumers thought that was a better quality price point. And Subway came in on the lower end and aggressively promoted themselves as fresh.”

From the beginning, Quiznos targeted higher end consumers with arguably meatier, hotter sandwiches in comparison to Subway. So when many of the locations were set up they purposefully went for areas that were more middle class. But as the US recession hit deeper many just cared about the $5 sub and not whether Quiznos was a better product or not. Quiznos responded by lowering their prices, but since they kept their premium ingredients the profitability was squeezed to the point of bankruptcy.

The good news is that the Quiznos bankruptcy will not affect the independently owned and operated franchises, which is said to be the vast majority of locations. The corporation will also attempt to restructure in order to keep operating, but they’ve also closed about 2,500 locations over the last five years.###143||Why did this happen?

Flight cancellations tend to add to airline costs during the first quarter, when winter storms hit the hardest. Five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc UAL.N - said that winter storms had led to more than 78,000 canceled flights among them.

Some airlines cited a noticeable increase in their canceled flights tied to bad weather this year, with American Airlines saying its 28,000 cancellations for January and February more than doubled from the year earlier.

Delta said that as of the end of January, its cancellations from bad weather had topped all of those for 2013.

Delta told a J.P. Morgan investor conference disruption from winter storms hurt revenue for the current quarter by $90 million as it canceled 17,000 flights. The storms dented pretax profit for the quarter by about $55 million, Delta added.

The carrier said it expected operating margin, a measure of income to costs, of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent for the first quarter, compared with a prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent.

Cancellations can help unit revenue, an important measure of pricing power and how full planes are, as more travelers are put on remaining flights.

Delta said unit revenue would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter, compared with its prior view of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. American added it still expected unit revenue to rise about 2 percent to 4 percent in the period.

United said it halted 23,000 flights tied to weather in the first two months of 2014. The company had disclosed last month that disruption from the storms would hurt first-quarter unit revenue.

JetBlue told the same conference it canceled nearly 4,000 flights because of the winter storms, and Southwest said it halted about 6,500 flights in January and February.

JetBlue forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in first quarter unit revenue, while Southwest outlined expected growth of 3 percent.

Cowen & Co airline analyst Helane Becker cut her first quarter profit estimate for Delta to 30 cents a share from 32 cents in a note to clients, citing the updated outlook. She raised her quarterly estimate for Southwest to 17 cents a share from 14 cents, but also cut her estimate for JetBlue for the period to 6 cents a share from 13 cents.

Shares of the major U.S. airlines ended mixed, with Delta down 0.5 percent to $35.17 and United off 2.3 percent to $46.66. American was off 0.2 percent to $38.96 and JetBlue fell 1.8 percent to $8.87. Southwest shares rose 2.2 percent to $23.60.###145||###146||Hold Up!

Japan revealed on Monday its currency account deficit surged to a record high in January. Beginning on Monday, officials with the Bank of Japan are convening for two days of policy meetings, yet the body is likely to leave policy unchanged.

"Fundamentally speaking, data out of the U.S. has a bigger underlying market impact, but the psychological effect from Chinese economic indicators cannot be overlooked," President Koji Fukaya with FPG Securities in Tokyo told the news service on Monday. "The rise in yields after the upbeat U.S. data supports the dollar, but the latest indicators out of China dampen risk appetite and may foil the currency's advances against the yen."

The greenback and the common currency of the European Union edged down about 0.2 percent against the yen on Monday.

Analysts at Citigroup (C) raised their rating on JCP stock to “Buy.” Citigroup also increased its price target for JCP stock to $11, citing the retailer’s renewed focus on children’s and home products, Seeking Alpha notes.

Last month, JCP stock climbed after the company reported an adjusted fourth-quarter loss of 68 cents per share. That surprised analysts who had predicted a loss of 85 cents per share of JCP stock.

However, JCP’s fourth-quarter sales of $3.78 billion fell short of the $3.85 billion that Wall Street had expected.

JCP stock closed at $8.42 on Monday.

Gazprom's comments came as tensions over the crisis in Ukraine continue. While tensions have eased slightly this week, there are concerns over Gazprom's gas supplies to Europe that flow through Ukraine. However, any potential cut in gas supply will hurt Gazprom more than Europe, both in the near term and the long term.

Europe more secure

In 2009, following contract disputes, Russia shut gas supplies to Ukraine, which ultimately affected downstream customers in Europe. Earlier this week, Gazprom said that gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine were normal. However, gas supplies could be affected after the company said that it will raise gas prices for Ukraine from the start of April as the country has failed to pay its debts.

Any disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine could lead to a shutdown of gas supplies to Ukraine, which will have an impact on supplies to downstream customers in Europe. But can Europe cope with that? Although some 15% of Europe's total gas imports come through Ukraine, the continent is lot more secured this time than 2009.

In 2009, the gas supplies were cut in January, the coldest month in Europe. Additionally, Europe wasn't prepared for such a cut at the time. However, this time things are very different. The cuts to gas supplies, if they happen, will be in spring this time. Also, this spring season in Europe follows on the heels of an unusually mild winter. As a result, Europe's natural gas inventories are at their highest levels. According to Reuters, central Europe, which relies heavily on Russian gas supplies, has sufficient inventories. It is the same case with Germany, Europe's biggest gas consumer.

In addition, the shale boom in the U.S. has meant that the country now has record natural gas production. This has freed up LNG shipments on the global market, which could end up in Europe in case there is a shortage due to Russian supply cuts.

Gazprom believes otherwise

Although the latest crisis has once again raised questions over Russian gas supplies to Europe, Gazprom believes that the continent will become even more dependent on its gas supplies in the next few years. Speaking at an annual meeting with investors in London earlier this week, Gazprom's deputy head Alexander Medvedev said that the company has increased its share in European markets because Europe's domestic production has fallen in countries such as Britain and Norway.

In 2013, Gazprom accounted for 30% of Europe's total gas imports, compared to 25.6% in 2012. While Europe heavily relies on Russian gas at the moment, events such as those in the Ukraine will likely prompt the continent to start looking at alternative sources for its gas supplies.

As I noted in a previous article, the U.S. should take this opportunity to further its geopolitical interests by removing restrictions on natural gas exports to its allies in Europe. The shale boom, as I noted before, has also freed up LNG shipments from Qatar and Australia, which could end up in Europe. While Europe might be relying on Gazprom right now for its gas supplies, the situation will change dramatically if Russia continues to use the company to further its geopolitical interests.

Additionally, Gazprom is not in a position to lose revenue from Europe. Gazprom relies on Europe even more than Europe does on the company. Europe accounts for about three-quarters of Gazprom's export sales, and Gazprom therefore stands to lose more in the long term.

The company will also lose in the near-term if there are any supply cuts to Ukraine. According to Natural Gas Europe, 55% of gas exports to Europe were shipped via Ukraine. If Ukraine's gas supplies are disrupted, Gazprom and Europe have the option to reduce Ukrainian share to a third and fully load the Nord Stream pipeline. But Natural Gas Europe notes that in such a case, Gazprom will only fulfill two-thirds of its contractual obligations. In other words, Gazprom stands to lose a third of its revenue in the near term if supplies to Ukraine are cut.

Leveraging state-run companies

State-run natural resource companies have always been used for political gains. However, invariably, such moves have ended in a disaster for the company. Remember PDVSA of Venezuela and Pemex of Mexico?

More recently, the Brazilian government has used Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) for subsidizing fuel in the country. The result has been a weakening Petrobras. The company is the world's most indebted oil and gas company. Only a few years ago, Petrobras was seen as the next big thing in the oil and gas sector. However, the company has failed to live up to the expectations, thanks to some disastrous energy policy. Contrast this with BP Plc (NYSE:BP), which was written off after Gulf of Mexico oil spill but has managed to make a strong comeback in the past year.

Europe may be relying heavily on Gazprom at the moment, but the shale boom has changed the dynamics of the global energy market. Europe now has alternative sources for its gas supplies and can secure its energy needs even more if the U.S. removes restrictions on gas imports. Gazprom, therefore, stands to lose more if Russia continues to use the company to serve its geopolitical interests. The conflict in Ukraine will hurt Gazprom in the long-term, as well as potentially in the near term.

###152||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Gold futures closed 1% lower on Friday, suffering from their biggest one-day point and percentage loss in more than a week, after a closely-watched jobs report signaled stronger-than-expected employment trends, dulling the metal’s investment appeal.

The U.S. added 175,000 jobs in February, topping the 140,000 positions expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6%, edging up because more people entered the labor force in search of jobs but not all of them found one.

Safety plays like gold and Treasurys fell sharply in the wake of the jobs report.

Gold for April delivery US:GCJ4 fell $13.60, or 1%, to settle at $1,338.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was trading around $1,351, near Thursday’s settlement, immediately before the jobs data. For the week, prices held onto a gain of around 1.3%, based on the most-active contracts, according to FactSet data.

May silver US:SIK4 sank nearly 65 cents, or 3%, to end at $20.93 an ounce following a 1.4% climb a day earlier. Prices have lost about 1.5% week to date.

The jobs number was “not a blockbuster event, [but] it does end a downtrend of the past couple reports and turns around labor participation, which has been at levels last witnessed in the late 1970s,” said Jeffrey Wright, managing director at H.C. Wainwright.

The end result is a higher U.S. dollar DXY, +0.01% and gold is moving lower in reaction to that, he said.

Fed clues and Ukraine

The market had also been looking to the economic data for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

“Investors were looking for a number that could potentially ‘taper the taper’ but obviously that concept is completely off the table,” especially after New York Fed President William Dudley’s hawkish comments Thursday, said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00’s Report, which offers daily markets commentary.

Rex Nutting: Surprise rise in jobless rate gives Fed breathing room.

Gold is also experiencing a “lack of safe-haven demand,” with the situation in Ukraine having stabilized, said Wright. Still, “the end game is not currently clear and gold can still be viewed for safe-haven status in the coming weeks if the situation in Ukraine further degrades.”

Elsewhere in metals trading, April platinum US:PLJ4 lost $3.20, or 0.2%, to $1,483.60 an ounce, ending around 2.5% higher for the week, while March palladium US:PAM4 rose 65 cents, or 0.1%, to $781.80 an ounce, up roughly 5% for the week. Read: Palladium is the metal to own.

Fed tapering policy on course, but possible adjustment to forward guidance

UK Budget to avoid pre-election hype, delivering fiscally neutral, targeted measures

Emerging markets weigh on sentiment ... Financial markets are in a renewed risk-off phase, with bond yields and equity markets falling. This resulted, in part, from more evidence of a softening in Chinese activity. But more recently it has followed Ukrainian developments. These look set to maintain the tone for the coming week, particularly with Sunday’s planned referendum. The coming week also sees the latest FOMC meeting, where forward guidance may change; the prospect of a rebound in US surveys; and the UK Budget.



Ukrainian crisis reaches key stage... The Ukrainian situation is delicately poised with a Crimean referendum planned for Sunday. There has been precious little sign of the hoped for “de-escalation” to date and EU officials have warned that a referendum could prompt further sanctions from Western governments. In turn these risk Russian retaliation. Markets will follow developments, but any signs of escalation may be most visible in crude oil and other energy prices as well as further risk-off moves in markets.



Fed to adjust guidance ... The coming week sees the FOMC’s latest policy meeting. We expect the Fed to continue to taper its asset purchases by a further $10bn, taking QE down to $55bn/month. A number of Fed speakers have discussed the high threshold for changing this path leaving any other outcome a major surprise. However, more uncertainty surrounds the Fed’s guidance. With unemployment at 6.7%, the Fed’s promise not to tighten policy before unemployment reaches 6.5% is close to expiry. The Committee have publicly discussed possible next steps and we think there is a good chance that Fed Chairwoman Yellen will use this month’s press conference to set out the next stages. The Fed has a number of options, but we suspect that, like the Bank of England, it will adopt more qualitative guidance and avoid another quantitative target. Unlike the Bank, the Fed also publishes FOMC participants forecasts of the policy rate. This will be a useful tool to reinforce any new forward guidance message. Markets will also watch the publication of the first of March’s surveys over the coming week. Extreme weather began to recede in March, and these surveys could signal a rebound in activity.



UK Budget to avoid pre-election hype... Chancellor Osborne presents his latest Budget on Wednesday. With a General Election scheduled for next May, this will be the last Budget to meaningfully impact the economy before then. However, we expect the Chancellor to dash any hopes of pre-election stimulus. A recovery-inspired improvement in the headline public finances has done little to narrow a still elevated structural deficit. The Chancellor has promised a Budget of “hard truths”. We expect a fiscally neutral Budget helping to promote business investment and export potential.



The end of UK forward guidance? ... Before the Budget, the UK releases labour market figures. We expect employment growth to have slowed, but the unemployment rate is a closer call: we expect the rate to fall to 7.1%, but see it on the cusp of 7.0%, which would bring the first phase of the Bank’s guidance to a close (something we think will happen next month). With Governor Carney and MPC member Weale revealing differences in view this week, we will watch March’s MPC minutes for a fuller description of any divergences in views on the Committee.



Final euro area inflation the only highlight... Markets will pay closer attention than usual to final estimates of Euro area inflation on Monday.

“In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle,” said GM spokesman Alan Adler. “We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance.”

Dealers were notified of the rebate in a March 5th memo from GM, which also provided guidance on how to answer questions and concerns about the recall. The letter has since been posted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website.

GM is not suggesting owners of the affected cars buy a new vehicle to remedy the problem, the Free Press reports. Instead, the rebates are being offered as validation to GM’s commitment to customer service.

“This special cash allowance must be passed on to the eligible customer at the time of the transaction and is in addition to other national and regional offers,” the letter reads. “And is intended to assist those customers who are unhappy and may want to trade out of their vehicle or buy a new GM product.”

The letter also informed owners that parts for the ignition repairs will be available in April, and included instructions on how to request reimbursement for ignition switch repairs they have paid for in the past. If the ignition switch has been replaced in the past, it still needs to be replaced again as part of this recall.

In addition, GM is offering courtesy vehicles to those owners afraid to drive their vehicles, and will cover the towing costs for affected vehicles as well as the fees for rental vehicles.###159||Ukraine and Russia were the talk of the markets this week and made for some wild trading. Stocks were down big Monday when tensions increased, but Tuesday was one of the best days of the year, and by the end of the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 0.80%.

Russia is the world's largest oil producer, so it's worth keeping an eye on how it handles Ukraine and the region of Crimea, but the harsh drop of Russian stocks and the ruble on Monday may have been the warning it needed to not escalate the conflict. Russia's economy is on fragile ground, and markets showed that they'd crush Russian assets if a military conflict erupts.

While Russia garnered headlines, it was financial stocks that led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher this week. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the top stock, gaining 4.7%. Outside of hiring Apple's retiring CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for its board of directors, there wasn't a lot of news out about Goldman this week. Goldman continues to benefit from the strong market for underwriting stock and bond offerings, and as long as the economy continues to improve, the finance giant will fare well.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose 4.5% this week and settled another lawsuit. The company agreed to pay $400 million to Syncora Guarantee to settle mortgage-backed-securities lawsuits. The bond insurer was claiming JPMorgan misrepresented the quality of loans in securitized and therefore increased liabilities to Syncora. This is on top of $23 billion in fines and settlements last year, but thus far it's done little to slow down JPMorgan's stock.

American Express (NYSE:AXP) was up 2.8% to round out the top three stocks this week. Again, there was little significant news, but the slowly improving economy is helping revenue and earnings as consumers spend more money. The other advantage American Express has is that it more heavily targets affluent consumers than its rivals do. Those consumers are doing well in this economy, which will bode well for American Express long-term.###160||Empty###161||Editors Pick

The downtown Los Angeles nutritional supplement company said it would cooperate fully with the FTC and is “confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The FTC confirmed the inquiry but declined to disclose details.

Pershing Square Capital Management’s Bill Ackman, who has had a $1 billion short bet on Herbalife since mid-2012, launched a campaign to bring down Herbalife in December of that year. Ackman says he considers its multilevel marketing sales model an illegal Ponzi scheme, in which the company and its top independent distributors make more money recruiting new distributors than selling products to outside customers.

Herbalife shares initially slumped, but have since more than recovered. Ackman in recent months has attempted to recruit regulators, public officials and consumer groups to investigate and criticize the company. On Tuesday he expanded his campaign overseas, accusing the company of violating direct sales laws In China, one of Herbalife’s fastest-growing markets.

Herbalife's shares, which earlier fell more than 16 percent after the FTC news, later recovered to close down $4.82, or 7.4 percent, to $60.57 on the New York Stock Exchange.###166||Empty###167||Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

American Eagle Outfitters Inc.'s profit in the fourth quarter tanked on lower sales and one-time charges.

The South Side-based teen-apparel retailer said net income was $10.5 million, or 5 cents a share, in the 13 weeks ended Feb. 1. That compares with net income of $94.8 million, or 47 cents a share, in the 14 weeks ended Feb. 2, 2013.

“The company's results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations,” interim CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a statement. “We're taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers.”

After removing one-time write-offs, American Eagle's adjusted net income in the quarter was 27 cents a share, down from 55 cents a share the year before.

Analysts had expected adjusted net income of 26 cents a share, according to Bloomberg.

Sales were $1 billion in the quarter, down from $1.1 billion the year before. Sales at stores open at least a year declined 7 percent.

The company fired CEO Robert Hanson in January after disappointing holiday sales. Schottenstein, the company's chairman and former CEO, took over on an interim basis.

American Eagle expects first-quarter sales to decline and profit to be flat, as “business conditions remain challenging, with severe winter weather contributing to weak demand.”

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned imports from Indian generic drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's plant at Karkhadi in the western state of Gujarat, in the latest quality blow for India's drug sector.

The FDA has imposed a rash of regulatory sanctions on Indian generic makers in the last year, triggering concerns about the quality of the medicines supplied by the $14 billion industry to countries including the United States, the biggest market.

India is second only to Canada as a drug exporter to the United States, where it supplies about 40 percent of generic and over-the-counter drugs.

"The FDA is becoming more stringent. It's a learning curve for everyone. You have to invest more," said B&K Securities analyst Rohit Bhat. "Companies will have to pull up their quality parameters."

It was not immediately clear why the FDA imposed the ban on Sun Pharma's Karkhadi plant.

The FDA issued an "import alert" against the factory on its website said on Wednesday. The agency defines such a sanction as something that results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices.

The ban on the plant underscores growing concerns about the quality of medicines made in India, often referred to as the low-cost "pharmacy to the world", as demand for generics grows in countries from the United States to Japan.

A Sun Pharma spokeswoman said the financial impact of the FDA ban on U.S. shipments from the plant, which makes antibiotic cephalosporin, would be "negligible". The plant accounts for less than 1 percent of its overall sales, she said.

Sun Pharma also said it had initiated "several corrective steps" to address the FDA's concerns, and kept its guidance for consolidated sales for the fiscal year ending this month.

The Karkhadi plant is one of Sun Pharma's 25 manufacturing plants, of which 11 are in India. Three of those plants, including the Karkhadi plant, are in Gujarat.

Shares in Sun fell as much as 6.4 percent on Thursday.

Industry officials in India say weak local regulatory oversight and a lax approach to quality control by some drugmakers in a rush to tap growing global demand for generics can result in sub-standard manufacturing processes.

The urgency to be first with a generic version of a drug coming off patent is one of the reasons for quality problems, they say. The company that first launches such a drug enjoys a six-month exclusivity period, which can be lucrative for the generic version of a commercial blockbuster.

MORE INDIAN COMPANIES SCRUTINISED

The FDA, which last month called for more collaboration with the Indian regulator to improve drug quality, has banned imports from all the Indian plants of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd India's No.1 drugmaker by sales, over production quality lapses.

Separately, rival drug maker Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd started a recall of 58,656 bottles of its heartburn drug lansoprazole in the United States in January due to a microbial contamination, information posted on FDA website on Wednesday showed.

A spokesman for Dr Reddy's was not immediately available to comment.

Also this month, the FDA announced drug recalls from both Ranbaxy and Sun Pharma.

India's Wockhardt Ltd has also been barred from exporting drugs from some of its plants to the United States and Britain.

Most of the drugs that Ranbaxy, Wockhardt and their Indian peers, including Dr Reddy's and Lupin Ltd, export to the United States are cheaper copies of drugs with expired patent protection.

"When a company is small, it can be managed by strong supervision. As companies get bigger, supervision can break down," said a chief executive officer at a top Indian drugmaker.

"You need systems and a culture to maintain proper supervision - and we are in that process of growing up, I think," said the CEO, declining to be identified.

Libya’s parliament threw Ali Zeidan out of office in light of a dispute over an oil-laden tanker that escaped from port. (Reuters)

Libya’s parliament handed a no-confidence vote to Prime Minister Ali Zeidan on Tuesday in yet another jolt to the oil-rich nation’s crumbling political stability.

Libya’s elected General National Congress (GNC) ousted Zeidan a day after the government failed to stop a North Korean-flagged oil tanker from departing Libya’s eastern shore with an unauthorized $36 million cargo of crude oil.

Less than three years after the fall of dictator Moammar Gaddafi, Libya has been riven by increasingly violent political animosities as powerful militias, aligned with rival political factions, have struggled to exert control over key government offices, territory and — significantly — the country’s vast oil resources.

Federalist fighters seeking autonomy for eastern Libya have laid siege to some of the country’s key oil wells and ports, effectively paralyzing exports for the past six months.

The weekend docking of the North Korean tanker marked the first independent sale of oil by a non-state body, threatening to escalate regional and tribal tensions into a full-fledged war.

By Tuesday night, fighting had erupted in the central city of Sirte as militias, moving east from the city of Misurata in an effort to seize the eastern ports, came to blows with an eastern militia.

Zeidan had earlier threatened to use force if the tanker tried to leave. But after a three-day stand-off between the eastern rebels and government-allied forces, the rebels said Tuesday that the tanker had entered international waters.

“We don’t care what the GNC does with Zeidan. They can do what they like,” said Senussi El-Megrabi, a spokesman for rebel commander Ibrahim al-Jathran. “We have nothing to do with them.”

The tanker, the Morning Glory, left Libya’s Sidra port at 8 a.m., Megrabi said.

Libya’s deeply divided parliament on Tuesday designated the country’s defense minister to take over for Zeidan for the next 15 days until the body selects a new prime minister, state media reported. That person would become the country’s fifth prime minister in just over two years.

Zeidan’s popularity quickly plummeted during his year and a half in office, amid widespread frustration at his failure to empower the country’s weak government institutions and disarm the militias that control the streets. Zeidan’s opponents have accused him of having his own ties to one powerful militia and of making payoffs to others for their compliance.

The country appeared on the verge of spiraling into further chaos Tuesday night as rumors circulated in Tripoli that the tanker had come under attack and caught fire, and as the fighting raged on in Sirte.

Megrabi said that rebel forces had already repelled an earlier attack by Misurata fighters but were undeterred. The rebels have said that any attacks by government-allied forces would constitute an act of war.

“We are expecting another tanker to Heriga port,” he added. “But I don’t know when exactly that will be.”###175||Empty###176||Interest rates on mortgage loans remained mostly unchanged at U.S. lender, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Wednesday, March 12.

More safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish technical posture prompted buying interest. April gold was last up $19.80 at $1,366.50 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $17.00 at $1,367.00. May Comex silver last traded up $0.445 at $21.62 an ounce.

The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. This coming weekend could be pivotal in this geopolitical crisis. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. The Group of Seven nations was set to release a statement Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s likely that the G-7 will soon impose official economic and diplomatic sanctions on Russia.

U.S. economic data released Wednesday was again light and did not impact the markets. In other news Wednesday, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank’s monetary policy. The ECB has been battling tepid EU economic growth and deflationary concerns with a very stimulative monetary policy.

While gold and the raw commodity sector have fared well in the first quarter of 2014, the copper market has seen its price fall dramatically the past week. Comex copper futures prices hit a nearly four-year low Wednesday. Part of the selling pressure on copper comes from concerns about weakening Chinese economic growth. Crude oil prices have also been pressured in part by the concerns about a weakening Chinese economy. China is the world’s largest copper consumer. Copper is a major industrial metal worldwide. And many veteran stock market watchers say copper’s price move can be a harbinger of price action in the U.S. stock market. Concern about the health of the Chinese economy has weighed down the Asian and European stock markets this week. The fact gold has been able to make gains this week, despite the above circumstances, is impressive.

The London P.M. gold fix is $1,366.00 versus the previous P.M. fixing of $1,346.25.

Technically, April gold futures prices closed nearer the session high Wednesday and hit a fresh six-month high. A 2.5-month-old uptrend is in place on the daily bar chart. Bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage and gained more upside momentum Wednesday. The gold bulls’ next upside near-term price breakout objective is to produce a close above solid technical resistance at $1,400.00. Bears' next near-term downside breakout price objective is closing prices below solid technical support at last week’s low of $1,326.60. First resistance is seen at Wednesday’s high of $1,371.30 and then at $1,375.00. First support is seen at $1,360.00 and then at $1,350.00. Wyckoff’s Market Rating: 7.0

May silver futures prices closed nearer the session high Wednesday on short covering. The bears still have the slight near-term technical advantage. Prices are in a three-week-old downtrend on the daily bar chart. Silver bulls’ next upside price breakout objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the March high of $21.74 an ounce. The next downside price breakout objective for the bears is closing prices below solid technical support at this week’s low of $20.61.

May N.Y. copper closed up 55 points at 295.75 cents Wednesday. Prices closed nearer the session high on tepid short covering after hitting a fresh contract and nearly four-year low early on. Weak economic data coming from China last weekend has helped to sink the copper market. Prices are in an accelerating 10-week-old downtrend on the daily bar chart. Bears have the solid near-term technical advantage. Copper bulls' next upside breakout objective is pushing and closing prices above solid technical resistance at this week’s high of 307.75 cents. The next downside price breakout objective for the bears is closing prices below solid technical support at 290.00 cents. First resistance is seen at Wednesday’s high of 298.15 cents and then at 300.00 cents. First support is seen at 294.00 cents and then at Wednesday’s contract low of 290.80 cents.

Follow me on Twitter @jimwyckoff###180||NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock indexes declined for a fourth day and copper dipped to near four-year lows before rebounding on Wednesday as worries about China’s economic slowdown intensified.

The concerns over China also pressured the Chilean peso and other currencies closely linked to commodities markets, while increasing investor appetite for safe-haven assets boosted U.S. government bonds and gold.

The moves follow China’s first domestic bond default, which has raised concerns about a possible unraveling of the many loan deals which have used copper as collateral.

Chinese firms that have difficulty raising loans have often bought copper as security for funds they borrow, but the 14 percent drop in copper’s value this year is making banks more wary about the practice.

Data, including China’s recent weak export numbers, has underscored worries that the world’s second-largest economy is slowing. This has added to strains on emerging markets already hit by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to scale back its economic stimulus.

“People are reluctant to make big bets right now,” said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York. “People are just reducing their short position in emerging market exposure.”

Copper on the London Metal Exchange slid to a session low of $6,376.25 a tonne, its weakest level since July 2010, before recovering to end at $6,505, up 0.5 percent from Tuesday’s close. Three-month LME copper has shed more than 11 percent this year, including a 2.6 percent drop on Tuesday.

“Most people are still cautious so we can’t expect a quick rebound,” said Andrey Kryuchenkov, analyst at VTB Capital. “On a fundamental point of view we have to wait and see in the second quarter how China stimulates its economy.”

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 reversed early losses and ended nearly flat amid signs of progress in diplomatic attempts to ease tensions in Ukraine.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.17 points or 0.07 percent, to 16,340.08, the S&P 500 gained 0.57 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,868.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.144 points or 0.37 percent, to 4,323.332.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in London on Friday ahead of a referendum Sunday on whether Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula will join Russia.

“People are just kind of reassessing, they are looking at that headline and thinking maybe it is not going to turn out to be a disaster in Russia and Ukraine,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.

Shares of Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB fell sharply, a day after leaders of the Senate Banking Committee announced an agreement on legislation to wind down the government-owned mortgage financiers. Fannie Mae dropped 12.2 percent to $3.54, while shares of Freddie Mac tumbled 16.8 percent at $3.36.

The difference in yield on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds over Treasuries declined on the view the Senate plan would assure the government’s guarantee of their existing debt. The yield gap between five-year Fannie Mae notes due February 2019 over five-year Treasuries narrowed 0.005 percentage point to about 0.15 percentage point.

In Europe, shares .FTEU3 closed down 1.1 percent, with shares in big exporters among the hardest hit. German industrial conglomerate Siemens (SIEGn.DE) was down 2.2 percent and BASF (BASFn.DE), the world's fifth-largest agrochemicals and seeds maker, was down 1.9 percent.

An index of global stocks was down 0.5 percent, while an emerging market stock index .MSCIEF dropped 1.1 percent.

In the foreign exchange market, emerging market currencies rebounded from early losses tied to nervousness over China’s economy.

The Chilean peso fell to near five-year lows on a deepening selloff in copper in Asian trading. Chile, a major copper exporter, saw its currency recover to 572.08 pesos.

The Aussie was up after falling earlier in the session.

MOVE TO SAFE-HAVEN AREAS

U.S. Treasuries prices rose on worries over the health of China’s economy, which helped fuel strong demand at the U.S. government’s 10-year Treasury note auction.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 12/32 in price to yield 2.72 percent versus a yield of 2.766 percent late on Tuesday. Bond yields move inversely to their prices.

Gold surged 1.3 percent, hitting a near six-month high as fears of more corporate defaults in China and the tug-of-war between Russia, Ukraine and the West boosted bullion’s appeal.

Spot gold gained 1.3 percent to $1,367.04 an ounce, having reached $1,370.60, the loftiest since September 20

CHINA IN FOCUS

Economists are concerned that recent moves by Beijing to stamp out speculation on its rising currency and overly easy lending may have overshot and will damage China’s economy.

Reuters reported that China’s central bank is prepared to loosen monetary policy if economic growth slows further by cutting the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves. [ID:nL3N0M8207] This was a positive sign for markets, but also a possible indication of Beijing’s growing nervousness.

OIL DROPS

Oil prices declined, with U.S. crude oil falling by more than 2 percent in its biggest drop in two months, after the United States announced unexpected plans for a test release of strategic oil reserves while weekly data showed a big rise in crude stockpiles.

Brent crude fell 53 cents to settle at $108.02 and U.S. oil futures dropped $2.04 to settle at $97.99.###181||Empty###182||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

The Morning Glory , which docked in al-Sidra port on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held port since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

"The tanker left and is now in international waters," Reuters quoted Mohammad Hitab, spokesman for the state-run al-Waha Oil Company operating the al-Sidra port, as saying.

Rebels demanding a bigger share of oil revenue and political autonomy in the east seized three ports last summer and partly control a fourth.

The central government had threatened armed action , even an air strike, to prevent the tanker from getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

Members of the General National Congress (GNC), Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.

Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

The tanker's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi.

In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel fighters have carved out their own fiefdoms.###190||Warning - there was an unexpected script error.

The local currency, which has traded above US90¢ this week, slipped from Monday's high of US90.64¢, shedding about a quarter of a cent after a monthly survey by the National Australia Bank showed February business conditions deteriorated sharply. It was buying US90.28¢ late Tuesday.

The dollar was not weighed down further even as spot iron ore prices recorded their biggest one-day fall in more than four years at the beginning of the week, Chinese steel future sank to record lows and copper continued to weakened.

Iron ore for immediate delivery to China slumped by 8.3 per cent to $US104.70 a tonne.

"With US rates rising once again and the above concerns simmering in commodity markets the Australian dollar has held up remarkably well. Part of this has been driven by a continued re-pricing of the prospects for the domestic economy," ANZ economists said.###194||News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services###195||By Chelsey Byers

Folks, there are only two weeks left to enroll in a Health Insurance Plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace as mandated by the Affordable Care Act, a law that requires individuals to purchase health insurance coverage.

The ACA was passed to make sure that everyone has access to health insurance and that the insurance covers 10 essential health benefits:

1. ambulatory patient services;

2. emergency services;

3. hospitalization;

4. maternity and newborn care;

5. mental health and substance abuse services;

6. prescription drugs;

7. rehabilitative services and devices;

8. laboratory services;

9. prevention and wellness services; and

10. pediatric services (including oral and vision care).

Enrollment ends March 31 for health coverage for this year. It has been reported that the deadline will not be extended. If health insurance coverage is not purchased, there is a penalty. The individual penalty increases each year through 2016.

The online Health Insurance Marketplace has been open since Oct. 1 for individuals and small businesses to shop for health insurance. Coverage begins depending on when one enrolls. The ACA will provide families and small businesses that currently do not have an insurance option to choose health coverage that meets their needs based on their budget.

For those 65 and older, Medicare coverage is not obtained through the ACA Marketplace. Therefore, for the most part, people on Medicare are not overly affected by the ACA with the exception of some benefits.

The federal Medicare site, medicare.gov, highlights five things that people on Medicare should know about the ACA and their Medicare benefits.

There are care navigators who are available locally to help people work through the sign-up process. According to the Get Covered Illinois website, there are seven sites in the Champaign-Urbana area.

Under the civil rehabilitation procedure that Mt. Gox is currently subscribed to, rehabilitation claims can only be confirmed after a filing and an investigation. Mt.

Virtu, a high-frequency trading firm in New York, has filed paperwork with US regulators for a public share sale.

Founded by former New York Mercantile Exchange head Vincent Viola, it is the first high-speed trading firm to become a publicly listed company.

Virtu reported profits of $184m (£111m) in 2013, a 108% increase from 2012.

High frequency trading is where traders create complicated algorithms to buy and sell stocks in milliseconds, faster than any human.

It has grown in popularity in recent years, but it has also come under scrutiny for supposed risks.

Virtu said in its regulatory filing that the company has only recorded only a single day of trading losses in the past five years.

Virtu says it plans to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol VIRT.

It aims to raise around $100m in its share sale, although that number could change based on investor demand.

Risky business

In May 2010, computerized trading was blamed for the "flash crash" which briefly sent US markets down 5% before the error was discovered.

Ever since, there has been increasing focus on the rise of electronic trading and their impact on traditional stock exchanges.

Knight Capital, a New Jersey-based trading firm, lost close to $440m and almost had to file for bankruptcy after a computer glitch caused the firm to execute 150 mistaken orders to the New York Stock Exchange.

The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently said it was looking into regulating trading practices at firms, after publishing a report on the industry in September.###199||Chinese tat bazaar e-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba Group has finally announced plans to IPO, but in something of a surprise it will take place in the US rather than Hong Kong.

The firm, which runs China’s hugely popular Taobao and T-Mall e-commerce platforms, could be valued as high as $200 billion and may even raise more than the $16bn Facebook pulled in the day it hit the stock market..

A brief statement from the company offered the following:

Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States. This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals. Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China.

Considering this IPO could make Alibaba the second biggest web business in the world behind Google, at least in terms of market capitalisation, it’s something of a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

It had been in discussions with the Hangzhou-headquartered firm for months but couldn’t agree to Alibaba’s demands that it continue nominating most of the board after going public, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The exchange’s CEO Charles Li is now apparently calling for reforms to ensure that Hong Kong doesn’t lose out in the future.

Alibaba had this to say to the SAR:

We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group. We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.

The IPO will be good news for both Yahoo and Softbank.

Although Alibaba bought back 20 per cent of Yahoo’s shares in it back in 2012, the US internet pioneer still has a stake of over 20 per cent in the company.

Japanese operator Softbank, meanwhile, owns north of a third.

Alibaba’s global coming-out party is another sign the growing presence of major Chinese tech companies on the world stage.

Just last week, microblogging giant Sina filed for a $500m US IPO.

Shenzhen-headquartered Tencent – which stepped up its rivalry with Alibaba recently by taking a stake in China’s number two e-com player, JD.com – is listed in Hong Kong with a market value of around $140bn.

Apart from B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms, Alibaba runs online payment service Alipay, WeChat rival Laiwang and financial platform Yu'e Bao.

It has also been ramping up investment in cloud services and operates the controversial AMOS mobile OS. ®

US investigators said that data from the Boeing 777 showed that the plane continued to fly after it vanished off the radar during a flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The discovery raised the possibility that a pilot or some rogue passenger could have turned off the jet’s transponders so it could not be detected by radar before being diverted to an unknown location, the paper said.

US counterterrorism officials said they have no specific evidence that points to a hijacking or terror-related incident, but they have not ruled it out.

One astounding scenario discussed at a recent briefing was that a person commandeered the aircraft and landed it at an ¬unknown location “with the intention of using it later for another purpose,” the Journal said.

Malaysia’s defense minister denied the Journal’s report and said it was wrong, according to the Associated Press.

Meanwhile, suspected debris spotted by a Chinese satellite Wednesday raised the possibility that the jet had crashed and wreckage had been found in the ocean.

But early Thursday, Malaysia’s civil-aviation chief said a search of the site turned up no debris.

“There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,” Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

Although the fate of the jet has devolved into one of the world’s great mysteries, authorities said that everything appeared to be normal on board Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 minutes before it went missing over the South China sea early Saturday.

“All right, roger that,” a pilot replied to a radio message from Malaysian air control.

The jet’s last communication was revealed by Malaysian officials at a news conference held in Beijing for relatives of the 154 Chinese citizens among the missing passengers.

The updates came as an oil-rig worker claimed he saw a jet go down off the southeast coast of Vietnam.

In an e-mail sent to his employer, the worker describes seeing what he believes to be the missing Boeing 777 burning in one piece at high altitude, flying perpendicular to the standard jet routes that cross over the area.

“I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down,” the man writes, according to an ¬e-mail obtained and tweeted by ABC News anchor Bob Woodruff.

According to Woodruff, Vietnamese officials confirmed they received the e-mail but found nothing in the water.###207||Empty###208||TRIPOLI, March 17 (Reuters) - A tanker that loaded oil at a Libyan rebel port is on its way back to Libya after U.S. Navy forces seized it, the Libyan government said on Monday.

Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.###209||An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth US$201 million ($236m).

The man who cobbled the deal together said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a US$100m policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a US$201m hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a "well-known billionaire."

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday.

Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

"He wants his next of kin to keep working hard," Frances said.

Frances said that the annual premium is in "the low, single digits of millions of dollars."

He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder.

Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other startups, declined to discuss with the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###210||



BEIJING: More than 100 million urban migrants in China are to be given vital documents making them officially residents of the country's cities under a broad urbanisation plan that is crucial for economic growth.

China's new leaders, under President Xi Jinping who took office a year ago, have touted "people-centred urbanisation" to raise the quality of life as well as just growth rates.

The "national plan for a new model of urbanisation" unveiled Sunday calls for measurable improvements such as extended social benefits, improved air quality – an issue that causes widespread public anger – and expanded public transport.

It aims for 60% of China's 1.36 billion people to live in cities by 2020 and for 45% to have the vital urban residency registration, or hukou, that gives them equal access to social benefits such as education and health care.

This would compare with 52.6% and 35.3% as of 2012.

The stated goals include "work hard to achieve 100 million rural workers and other permanent residents obtaining urban hukou".

The change would narrow the proportion of urban residents who lack urban hukou – a move which analysts say is crucial in improving living standards for migrants from the countryside, hundreds of millions of whom have moved to the cities in recent decades.

"Urbanisation is a powerful engine for maintaining the sustainable healthy development of the economy," the plan said.

Rural Chinese, "by becoming urban residents will enjoy better public services, causing the urban consumer pool to continue to expand", it said, calling domestic demand "a fundamental driver of China's economic development".

China's leaders have repeatedly pledged to retool the country's growth model to one driven by consumer demand rather than investment. But the plan also said urbanisation will "bring huge investment demand for city infrastructure, facilities for public services and housing construction, which will provide continuing power for economic development".

Among many goals, the plan called for 99% of migrant children to receive nine years' education, and for 95% of the rural labourers and others who struggle to find work to receive free basic job training.

It said 60% of cities should meet national air quality standards, up from 40.9% in 2010.

The official news agency Xinhua stressed authorities' commitment, saying the plan "will provide strategic and fundamental guidance for the healthy development of urbanisation across the country". – AFP



###211||Empty###212||Empty###213||Industry leaders gave a generally loving welcome to the agreement on GSE reform reached by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Ranking Member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, today, with smaller lenders and one investor and taxpayer-minded politician making up a significant dissent faction.

The Senators are planning to introduce the legislation soon.

The long-anticipated agreement is the latest attempt to craft a bill that overhauls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's role in mortgage finance while opening up space for the private sector. The agreement builds on the earlier Corker-Warner bill as senators try to find middle ground. Of course any bill passed by the Senate will still have to get through the House of Representatives.

Sponsor Content

The Bipartisan Policy Center Housing Commission issued a statement that applauded the senators, and said that the agreement reflected many of the items on the BPC's own report last year, including "the gradual wind down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; a greater role for private capital in assuming mortgage credit risk; a continued, but more limited, role for the federal government as the insurance backstop of last resort in the secondary market for mortgage-backed securities; and a commitment to ensuring access to safe and affordable mortgages for all borrowers in all geographic markets."

David Stevens, president and CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, "This announcement reinforces the immediate need to address GSE reform in a substantive, transparent way." Stevens commended the senators for their bipartisan work and pledge to work together with the Committee.

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association hailed the agreement as "a positive development" and commended the senators' work on the project. "Clarification of U.S. housing policy is critical to maximizing the ability of private capital to fund mortgage credit creation. SIFMA and our members will remain constructive partners in the effort to reform and revitalize our secondary mortgage market..." the association said in a statement.

However, not everyone is happy with the agreement.

Smaller lenders, especially community banks, want to make sure they can still be competitive, and that they will not have to share their customer data. After commending the efforts of the senators, a statement by the Independent Community Bankers of America warned that any legislation would have to:

allow community banks to sell loans through an independent entity that does not compete with community banks

do not appropriate community bank customer data for cross-selling of financial services

preserve the Federal Home Lon Banks as a community bank access pint to the national secondary market

ensure pricing of any government guaranty is fair and equal for all market participants regardless of volume of loans guaranteed

do not result in the consolidation of the housing-finance system to only a select few mega-financial institutions

Investors in the GSEs have expressed concern that the agreement doesn't broach the topic of the third amendment, which changed the 10% cash dividend paid to Treasury to a system where the GSEs pay all of their quarterly profits to Treasury.

Senator Pat Toomey, R-Pa., addressed these remarks to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, on behalf of "community banks, retirement funds and other investors":

"While I strongly support GSE reform that protects taxpayers, such efforts should also be mindful of investors in addition to other considerations," Toomey said in the letter. "Taxpayers should be fully compensated, but once they are, investors, such as the York County pension fund in Pennsylvania, should not be denied their fair share of any remaining value."



"What comfort can you give to private sector investors considering investing in the future of the housing finance system when they believe that the government arbitrarily changed the rules of the game mid-stream with the Third Amendment?" he asked.

Toomey also questioned Lew on the Treasury's stake in Fannie and Freddie, and why the GSEs have not be consolidated on the Federal balance sheet.###214||

This is the second time in three years that Sbarro has filed for bankruptcy protection, due to lower customer traffic in the malls and a growing pile of debt.

Sbarro and its company affiliates filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws permit businesses more time to reorganize assets and offers them a chance to restructure their business in order to pay off the debts, unless the companys debt exceeds its assets. In most cases the trustee or creditor is given empowerment to operate the debtors business, till the debtor can lower its debt or come up with a plan to liquidate its assets.

The pizza company based out of New York has around $100 million and $500 million in both assets and liabilities, according to court papers.

Sbarro has continually struggled with with high food, labor and occupancy costs, according to Moody investors.

Despite the store closures across North America Sbarro will still have more than 800 stores worldwide, including those owned by franchisers.

Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro founded the pizza chain in 1956, after moving to the United States from Italy. The company originally started out as a small Italian grocery store that sold pizza by the slice, before becoming popular and opening up pizza restaurants in malls across America.

Sbarro previously applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in, April 2011, after listing assets of $471 million and debt of $486.6 million. In 2011 it was the fifth largest pizza chain in America, according to Pizza Today.

The pizza chain was granted court approval to emerge from bankruptcy under a plan requiring restructuring and ceding ownership to lenders.

Now the franchised company is forced yet again to file for bankruptcy protection due to its poor financial situation.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise - the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association.

"This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."

Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 per cent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines.

Overall, LA Metro gained 9 million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said.

Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain.

So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego.

The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said.

"Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."###222||* Alibaba’s US IPO move could be a blow to Hong Kong stock exchange

* Analysts estimate Alibaba to be valued at least $140 bln

* Alibaba listing is the most anticipated deal since Facebook’s IPO in 2012

* In talks with six banks for lead underwriting roles

By Elzio Barreto and Denny Thomas

HONG KONG, March 16 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has decided to hold its long-awaited IPO in the United States and is in discussions with six banks to underwrite the deal, in what is set to the most high-profile public offering since Facebook Inc’s listing nearly two years ago.

Alibaba said in a statement on Sunday it had decided to begin the U.S. IPO process, ending months of speculation about where it would go public.

Separately, sources told Reuters that Alibaba is in discussions with Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley for lead underwriting roles.

Most of the six banks are to set to win the coveted role of joint global coordinator, added the sources, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Analysts estimate the Hangzhou, China-based company has a value of at least $140 billion, and the IPO proceeds could exceed $15 billion, Reuters previously reported. The deal would be a huge coup for the six banks, as it would yield an estimated $260 million in underwriting fees, assuming 1.75 percent commission, and catapult them in league table rankings.

Alibaba declined to comment on the banks working on the deal. The banks mentioned in the report either declined comment or did not respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment.

“This will be a huge deal, bigger than what people were anticipating,” one person familiar with the process said, adding that the IPO was expected to be kicked off “very soon”.

Reuters reported on Saturday that Alibaba is planning a U.S. IPO in the third quarter, with a filing of documents expected as early as April.

BILLIONAIRE MA

Alibaba, whose platforms handle more goods than EBay Inc and Amazon.com Inc combined, was founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma and 17 other people. It has grown from a startup in Ma’s apartment to a behemoth with offices around the world and more than 20,000 employees.

The listing will be closely watched by Alibaba’s two largest shareholders - Yahoo Inc, which owns 24 percent, and Japan’s Softbank Corp, which controls 37 percent. Alibaba’s founders and some senior managers jointly own about 13 percent of the company.

Yahoo has said it plans to trim its stake in Alibaba through the IPO. It initially invested in Alibaba in 2005.

Alibaba’s decision to go to the United States is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company’s preferred venue for the IPO.

Alibaba also said in a statement on its corporate news Web site it might consider extending its public status to Chinese capital markets in future in order for investors there to be able to share in its growth.

Alibaba, which controls about 80 percent of the country’s e-commerce, had been in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission since last year about a listing, but the island city’s regulators blocked its proposal as it violated the “one-share-one-vote principle”.

Alibaba’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai upped the rhetoric against Hong Kong when he told Reuters last week that the firm would not change its partnership structure in order to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

After an initial rebuff, Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators were back at the negotiating table late last year, to find a solution to the problem. While the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd has initiated a review of its listing rules to accommodate more flexible structures, any change to the existing rules would take months.

“We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group,” Alibaba said in its statement.

“We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”###223||Empty###224||WASHINGTON — The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts. Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen's first news conference as Fed chair.

The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.

Will Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke's approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed's economic stimulus?

Or, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?

No major announcements are expected when the meeting ends Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.

The Fed's most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows "well past" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5 percent threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.

Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there's "not a large expectation" that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.

One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they're no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.

"There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate."

Yellen, who was sworn as chair on Feb. 3, has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That's partly why the Fed will likely announce this week a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage spending and growth.

In December and in January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. If the economy keeps improving, the Fed will likely keep paring its bond purchases until ending them altogether in December.

The pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that's depressed growth, to fears about how Russia's aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.

Still, Fed officials, including Yellen, have signaled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign the economy is losing momentum.

The Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth in 2014. Many think the economy, which grew a lackluster 1.9 percent in 2013, will rebound to around 3 percent this year.

"We had a tough start to the year with the winter storms, but it looks like we are starting to pull out of those weather effects," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.

Economists point to several hopeful signs — from a rebound in retail sales to an increase of 175,000 jobs in February despite continued harsh weather.

Even if the economy strengthens and the Fed ends its bond purchases late this year, it will still be stimulating the economy. It has no plans to start selling its enormous portfolio of bonds — a step that would likely send loan rates up. Nor is it likely this year to raise the benchmark short-term rate it controls.

More than five years ago, the Fed cut that rate to a record low near zero, where it's remained since. Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until late 2015.

One reason the Fed may choose this week to drop its mention of a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as a threshold for an eventual rate increase is that Yellen will hold a news conference. Her question-and-answer session with reporters would allow her to explain the Fed's reasoning for any change.

Under a plan established by Bernanke, the Fed's chair holds news conferences after four of the eight meetings each year. The next news conference isn't scheduled until June.

Not all economists expect the Fed this week to drop a link between a specific unemployment rate and an eventual rate increase.

"I don't think they will tweak the language," said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tuft University. "There is enough wiggle room currently."###225||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.

They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox's claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.

[ Also on InfoWorld: 19 open source GitHub projects for security pros. ]

Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.

Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.

Karpeles' blog was titled "Magical Tux in Japan -- Geekness brought me to Japan!" Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname "MagicalTux" when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline on Sunday shortly after it was attacked.

Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.

The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users' personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.

The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles' CV, and a Windows executable called "TibanneBackOffice," among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.

The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.

Mt. Gox's demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin's public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.

Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.

The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin's core software who've said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.

Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.

The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user's public bitcoin "address" or "wallet," which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.

Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox's bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.

In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.

At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.

Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.

"There's a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it's very, very difficult, and it's tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it's just obvious," he said.

The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cyber crime thefts on record.

An academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.

"For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange," they wrote.

Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.

"A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money," said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. "This is serious money for serious people."

Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.

If that's the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.

Why? Since August, eastern separatists have seized three major ports. The arrival of the tanker is just the latest of several steps to take a larger share of national oil wealth and create an autonomous state.

Since summer 2013 a band of armed men led by Ibrahim Jathran began seizing oil fields and ports in the north-east, where most of Libya's oil also happens to be concentrated. He operates under the auspices of a group known as the Cyrenaica Political Bureau (CPB) that has since proclaimed itself as the governing authority of the region. Threats to illicitly sell crude oil to rogue buyers have hung in the air for months. To the dismay of the central government led by prime minister Ali Zeidan, this is a potent weapon in the arsenal they are using to bargain for power.

The inability of the central government to intervene in this episode provides another example of their powerlessness. Threats to bomb the ship are empty ones. Ultimatums issued to militias by the government have repeatedly failed from the earliest days of the transition. As time wears on and warnings go either unheard or are met with violent force in response, the value of such statements becomes laughable. While improvements in naval capacity have been made in the past year, and naval forces have the capacity to mobilise and fire, land security rests in the hands of the country's scattered militias rather than a national army.

Attempts have been made to co-opt the various armed groups under a range of state umbrellas with varied success. Several government-aligned brigades – Misrata, February 17, Libya Shield – oppose Jathran's manoeuvring and are standing against him. Jathran was, in fact, once the head of the state force tasked with protecting oil production, the Petroleum Facilities Guard. The ease of movement this afforded him allowed him to usurp three ports – at Ras Lanuf, Zeitina and Sidra – and remain in control.

The number of men under his command remains unknown, with estimates ranging anywhere from 2,000-20,000, and the extent of his popular backing is debatable. Most Libyans see his actions as theft and his claims of regional authority as bluster. He and many of the ministers of the CPB are either non- or anti-Islamist. This automatically places him at odds with forces aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood or other religiously motivated groups. Libya's east is dominated by Islamist militias that may stand directly against him. The primary factor, however, is that Jathran is not paying most of their salaries – the central government is.

Jathran continues to pay and arm his own forces, however. As there have been no known takers of his offer to sell Libya's high-quality crude on an illegal basis, the sources of his funding are a mystery. It is suspected that wealthy Libyan businessmen are financing his army, and for roughly the same amount as the value of the oil in the ship – $30m. At this point, however, all that is conjecture.

The other salient mystery point remains: whose ship is it and for whom is the oil ultimately intended? It is known that it was at one stage owned by a registered Gulf oil company, but the details beyond this remain hazy. It could be that the ship, renamed Morning Glory, belongs to North Korea, but this is also doubtful. One must question why a state so monitored by western intelligence agencies would fly its flag in the middle of the Mediterranean, all the while attempting to steal oil from US companies. Some major firms – Exxon, BP, Royal Dutch Shell – have halted operations and pulled staff from Libya, but several others remain. Sidra port in particular is owned by Waha Oil, a National Oil Corporation company that is in partnership with US-owned Marathon, ConocoPhilips, and Hess. This may have been a factor in the quick response by the US – threatening sanctions if an illegal sale were made.

The tanker remains in port, full of oil, and in a stand-off with the Libyan navy and government-aligned militias. If Jathran and the CPB are able to sustain this scenario, they may have the best opportunity yet to establish the autonomous state they seek. But it is also possible they will simply alienate themselves from the majority of nations operating under international law. Or, and perhaps more likely, they are setting the stage for renewed civil conflict in Libya if negotiations with Tripoli fail.###228||Empty###229||The US Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal that could have gutted regulators’ authority to impose net neutrality rules — as conflict over the issue continues elsewhere###230||We told you last week that mediocre pizza-slinger and mall mainstay Sbarro would likely be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Today, it made that filing official, making this the second bankruptcy for Sbarro since the spring of 2011.

The pizza chain has some $140 million in debt to lenders. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bankruptcy plan would hand over control of the company to the creditors in exchange for wiping away that red ink. The lenders involved in the deal will also provide a $20 million bankruptcy loan to aid in restructuring the chain that has faltered in the face of increased competition and decreased foot traffic to the malls that have called Sbarro home for decades.

Sbarro will also be put on the auction block to see if anyone is willing to buy the beleaguered restaurant chain.

The bankruptcy comes on the heels of a recent announcement to shutter 155 of the remaining 400 Sbarro locations in North America. There are another 600 Sbarro locations outside of North America that are unaffected by this filing.

The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was able to substantially reduce its debt from $400 million to its current level.###231||Empty###232||Updates for this Live Event are currently disabled.###233||Already a subscriber?

The Department of Health and Human Services broke the news on Monday that 5 million people have now signed up for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act. With 14 days left in the open enrollment period, it appears that the final numbers will come close to or even reach the initial Congressional Budget Office estimates of 7 million people signing up in the first year. While the CBO has since amended that number down to 6 million, don’t be surprised if this final push gets it well above that.

Below is the press release from the website of the HHS:

As this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Fernando Valdez and Denise Schroeder were part of a weekend wave of consumers signing up for new coverage and bringing enrollment nationwide to more than 5 million through the Federal and State-based Marketplaces since October 1st. Fernando Valdez, 25, of El Paso, Texas woke up early on Saturday, after his mother insisted that he walk to an enrollment center and enroll in Marketplace coverage. Now, he will pay $22 a month for his health insurance. Fernando said that he walked away knowing that if “I get into an accident I will not be in trouble with trying to find health care.” Read more about Fernando’s story at: http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_25353816/enroll-el-paso-makes-push-get-residents-enrolled?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com. And Denise Schroeder says she now feels like “I have a whole new life” after enrolling in coverage in recent days. Denise, a small business owner in West Chester, Pennsylvania who runs “Happy Heart Clown N’Stuff” which does balloon decorating and entertainment for parties is also a cancer survivor. Because she had cancer, Denise knew she couldn’t let her health coverage lapse, but the $880 premium she was paying each month wiped out her savings account, and she said it was killing her. But after working with an enrollment navigator, she enrolled on Thursday in a Silver Plan for $22 a month. When she saw the new premium, she cried. You can find more stories like theirs at http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/mystory/index.html. Consumers like Fernando and Denise are coming every day to check out their options for affordable health care at HealthCare.gov or seeking help from a trained representative in person or via our 24/7 call center. The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -the busiest day since December 23—and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend. Last week, HealthCare.gov saw more than 4 million visits—and an additional 1 million visits this weekend. With only two weeks to go, we’re continuing to work hard to ensure that every American who wants to enroll in affordable coverage by the deadline of March 31st is able to do so. So don’t delay; tell your friends and family to sign up today.

Three weeks ago, ACA enrollment passed 4 million. Since then, we’ve seen another million sign up. No matter how much Republicans try to deny it, the ACA is going to be a rousing success in in its first year. Conservative pundits had a field day laughing at the ‘paltry’ enrollment numbers in October, apparently unaware that fewer people sign up at the beginning of an enrollment period than at the end. The message a few months ago was how there was NO WAY that millions of people would sign up for Obamacare. Conservatives kept bringing up that 7 million figure from the CBO and pointing out how much lower the final enrollment figure would be.

For months, the narrative, repeated over and over by the mainstream media, was about the ‘botched’ rollout of the ACA and the ‘disastrous’ Healthcare.gov website. While news anchors and pundits were repeating the same talking points day in and day out, whatever glitches that were hounding the website were found and fixed, and people in need of affordable health care continued to sign up.

Now here we are, two weeks away from the final deadline of this enrollment period, and we now see 5 million people have signed up. 5 million people have obtained quality healthcare because of this law. All despite the numerous roadblocks thrown up by Republican lawmakers trying their hardest to make the law fail before it even had a chance to be enacted. How many more would have had a chance to sign up already if the majority of states would have set up their own healthcare exchanges? If Red state governors would have allowed Medicaid expansion to take place, as provided for by the ACA, how many more people would have health coverage right now?

That’s the thing. Even with the petulant obstruction, 5 million people have signed up for healthcare under the ACA, and in the years to come, tens of millions more will. It is the law of the land. It is here to stay.###236||Empty###237||Obamacare short of enrollment target ahead of March 31 deadline

By Kate Randall

18 March 2014

The Obama administration is conducting an all-out push to sign up new enrollees for the Affordable Care Act before the March 31 deadline. According to regulations of the legislation popularly known as Obamacare, those without insurance through their employer or a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid must obtain insurance by the end of this month, or pay a tax penalty in 2015.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported last week that about 940,000 people signed up for plans through Obamacare in February, bringing the total to about 4.2 million, far short of the Obama administration’s original 5.7 million projection. People shopping for health insurance must select from plans offered by private insurers through the insurance exchanges set up under the ACA.

In addition to the overall low enrollment figures, the number of young people signing up is also far below original government forecasts. The administration had originally projected that those between the ages of 18 and 34 would account for 38.5 percent of enrollees. Of those signing up between October 1, 2013, and March 1 of this year, only 25 percent were in this age group.

The White House and private insurance companies are counting on young, healthy people signing up to offset the higher cost of insuring older, less healthy people. Insurance companies are depending on a sufficient influx of cash-paying, younger enrollees to maintain their profit margins. Under the ACA, the insurers are still allowed to charge three times as much for premiums for older enrollees.

The Obama administration’s efforts to court young people have included an interview with “American Idol” host Ryan Seacrest on his radio program last Friday, which followed a March 11 appearance on the comedy interview web series “Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifiankis.” The president’s last-ditch maneuvers are taking on an increasingly desperate and cynical character.

The latest marketing campaign by administration health care officials focuses on “March Madness,” the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men’s and women’s basketball tournaments that begin this week. Beginning Monday, Obama, some of his aides, and celebrity basketball players and coaches will conduct interviews, feature in public service ads and make appeals on social media. Obama was set to release Monday night a “16 Sweetest Reasons to get Covered” bracket modeled on the predictions for winners of the NCAA tournament.

In an effort to target the Hispanic audience, Obama was scheduled to appear Monday on the Univision Radio program “Locura Deportive” (Sports Madness), while ESPN Deportes will interview White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.

In an interview Friday on the popular health information site WebMD, the president stated he was confident enough people have signed up for Obamacare to make the program “stable.” However, pointing to the main purpose of his interview, he stressed “the more you can spread the risk with more people, the better deal you’re going to get.” He added, “You know, the impact in terms of the program has always been based more on the mix of people who sign up.”

While touting the law’s virtues, he acknowledged that lower-cost policies on the health care exchanges may have limited choices of doctors and other providers. “For the average person,” Obama said, “many folks don’t have insurance initially, they’re going to have to make some choices. And they may have to switch doctors, in part because they’re saving money.”

The president added that people may discover that a network “is more expensive than another network, and maybe you’ve got to make a choice about what’s right for your family.” In other words, the substandard plans are the only thing you and your family can afford, but because of the “individual mandate” you must purchase it or pay a penalty.

A survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Company reports that only about a quarter of the 4.2 million people signing up for insurance through the Obamacare exchanges through February were previously uninsured. This means that the program has so far made only a tiny dent in the estimated 48 million uninsured Americans.

The survey also found that of those shopping on the exchanges, only about half actually signed up for coverage, citing high premium prices as the reason for not buying insurance. They failed to enroll after visiting an online exchange despite the fact that four in five of this group qualified for government subsidies to purchase insurance under Obamacare.

In an appearance last month before the House Ways and Means Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated that ACA “premiums are likely to go up, but at a smaller pace than what we’ve seen since 2010.” While she failed to specify precisely what this “smaller pace” would look like in practice on the exchanges, other data on insurance premiums indicates private insurers will be hiking premiums substantially.

According to a report from eHealthInsurance, an online private insurance exchange, Americans purchasing coverage outside the Obamacare exchanges are seeing premiums up to 56 percent higher than before the health law took effect. The report shows families paying an average of $663 a month, with premiums as high as $2,604 a month for a family in California, and $1,845 in New York.

According to eHealthInsurance, rates have jumped as insurers shift the cost of covering the added features of the ACA to consumers. While the insurers are now required to cover certain essential health benefits, and cannot deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions, they are not sacrificing their profits to do so. This is placing individuals and families who are not insured through their employers, and in general do not qualify for government subsidies, in an impossible financial position.

A substantial number of people facing these huge premium hikes are those whose insurance was cancelled because it did not meet the ACA standards. The White House faced a backlash last year when several million people received notices of cancellation, contradicting Obama’s claim that “if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

These people were eventually given the option of keeping their plans temporarily in those states where insurance commissions allowed it. In the latest reported tweak to the health care law, these people have now been given a permanent exemption from the “individual mandate.”

You can now fill out a form attesting that you “believe that the plan options available in the [ACA] Marketplace in your area are more expensive than your cancelled health insurance policy” or “you consider other available policies unaffordable.” In other words, you will be exempted from the requirement to purchase qualified insurance, and can dodge the penalty, but you will be left without any health coverage whatsoever.

In an update to forecasts made in November, the Paris-based research body said growth is set to pick up in most large developed economies over coming years, but slowdowns in some large developing economies mean global economic growth is likely to remain moderate.

It said that while it believes the dip in growth in the U.S. during the final three months of last year and the first three months of this year is due to unusually severe weather and is likely to be short-lived, it is possible that “less transitory” forces are at work, including a rise in long-term interest rates over the past year.

Given the uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. recovery, and the impact tapering may have on developing economies, the OECD said while it is right for the U.S. Federal Reserve to scale back its asset purchase program, it should do so gradually over the next two years.

The OECD said the potential for further periods of financial market volatility and capital outflows from developing economies as the Fed and other central banks prepare to reduce their stimulus is one of the most significant threats to the global recovery.

More than a week after the jet vanished, a clearer picture is emerging of the events leading up to and immediately after its disappearance.

KUALA LUMPUR - More than a week after a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet vanished, a clearer picture is emerging of the events leading up to and immediately after its disappearance.

Much of the new information was revealed in a globally televised statement by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on March 15, which came after a week of false leads and dashed expectations during an intensive search in the South China Sea.

Najib revealed that the plane was apparently deliberately diverted and flown for hours after vanishing from radar -- to the west of Malaysia, far from the South China Sea, where the search has now been abandoned.

However, the mystery surrounding the eventual fate of the Boeing 777, and the 239 people on board, remains as planes and boats from an array of nations scour a huge swathe of the Indian Ocean for any sign of wreckage.

Here is a timeline of the plane's known last moments on March 8:

TAKE-OFF: Flight MH370 takes off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 am (1641 GMT Friday) bound for Beijing.

ACARS SHUTDOWN: The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits key information on the plane's mechanical condition, is manually switched off some time between 1:07 am -- when it sends its last data transmission -- and 1:37 am, when the next transmission would have been expected.

LAST WORDS: An apparently relaxed final voice communication -- "All right, good night" -- comes from the cockpit at 1:19 am, as the plane passes from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control over the South China Sea. The airline believes it was the co-pilot speaking.

TRANSPONDER SWITCHES OFF: The plane's transponder -- which relays radar information on the plane's location and altitude -- stops transmitting 14 minutes after the last ACARS transmission, at 1:21 am.

LAST RADAR CONTACT: The plane slips off Malaysian civilian radar screens at 1:30 am. While it continues to blip on military radars until 2:15 am, that sighting is only identified later as Flight MH370.

ROUTE CHANGE: The plane is believed to have turned sharply from its intended route after losing contact with civilian radar, flying west -- back over peninsular Malaysia -- before turning northwest.

LAST SATELLITE COMMUNICATION: Final, automated, satellite communications with the plane come at 8:11 am -- suggesting it may have flown on for hours after the ACARS system and transponder cut out.

The satellite data cannot pinpoint a location for the plane at 8:11 am. It places it anywhere on one of two huge arcs -- one stretching north from Malaysia up to central Asia, and the other south, deep into the Indian Ocean towards Australia.

A total of 25 countries are now involved in the massive hunt for any sign of the plane, with Australia announcing on March 17 that it is taking charge of the search in the southern arc.

In the first weekend of the plane's disappearance, it emerged that two passengers were travelling on stolen EU passports, fuelling speculation of a terrorist attack. Police then concluded that the pair were illegal Iranian immigrants.

But the terrorism thesis is now back in the spotlight along with possible hijacking or deliberate action by one or other of the pilots, who are now under investigation by Malaysian authorities along with the cabin crew, the passengers and ground engineers.

Silver dropped to a three-week low, while platinum and palladium declined.

Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent to $1,327.94 an ounce, and was at $1,331.31 at 9:10 a.m. in Singapore. Prices posted a fifth weekly gain last week, climbing to a four-month high of $1,354.87 on March 3, as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated, boosting demand for a haven.

Bullion rose 10 percent this year even as the Fed, which next meets March 18-19, announced a $10 billion reduction to bond buying at each of its past two meetings, leaving purchases at $65 billion. U.S. employers added 175,000 workers last month, compared with 149,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey.

“The better-than-expected payrolls data weighed on gold, but losses were limited by the political situation in Ukraine,” Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at Everbright Futures Co., said from Shanghai. “Both ETF and CFTC positions suggest that investors are still willing to hold gold for now,” said Sun, referring to gold in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and bets tracked by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Last week, holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products posted the first back-to-back weekly expansion since August, as pro-Russian forces advanced into the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Coutts & Co. said it’s adding gold for investors as increasing geopolitical risks spur haven demand.

Bullish Positions

Gold for April delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,331.30 an ounce on the Comex in New York, extending the 1 percent loss on March 7. Hedge funds and other speculators expanded bets on higher prices for a fourth week in New York futures and are now the most bullish since December 2012, government data show.

Silver for immediate delivery fell as much as 1.6 percent to $20.6142 an ounce, the lowest level since Feb. 14, and traded at $20.741. The metal declined 2.5 percent on March 7 to cap a second weekly retreat.

Platinum lost 0.9 percent to $1,469.25 an ounce after posting a fifth weekly rise, the longest run since August. Palladium fell 0.4 percent to $778.50 an ounce after climbing for a fifth week, the longest rally since 2012, on concern that supplies from Russia and South Africa, the biggest producers, may be disrupted.

South Africa, also the world’s largest platinum producer, won’t take sides in a wage strike that halted output for more than six weeks, President Jacob Zuma said.

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for Apple iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company's app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

(Read more: Shane Talbott: The million-dollar tea man)

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don't earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn't be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there's no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

(Read more: McDonald's sales slump in February, hit by weather)

"It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city," Lemke noted. Since she works at a drive-thru location, for instance, she noted that tips go down when it's cold out and people are less likely to reach out to put money in the secured tip box that hangs off a ledge.###252||22.20 We will wrap up our live coverage of the ongoing search for flight MH370 for today.

Lai Seng Sin/ AP

21.19 A US defense official says the Navy ship that has been helping search for the missing Malaysian airliner is dropping out of the hunt.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision has not been officially announced, said it was determined that long-range naval aircraft are a more efficient means of looking for the plane or its debris, now that the search area has broadened. Navy P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft are still involved in the search.

But the official said the USS Kidd, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer that has been searching in the Indian Ocean, will leave the area and return to its normal duties. It is part of the Navy's 7th Fleet.

19.46 Officials have revealed a new timeline suggesting the final voice transmission from the cockpit of the missing Malaysian plane may have occurred before any of its communications systems were disabled, adding more uncertainty about who aboard might have been to blame.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words heard from the plane by ground controllers - "All right, good night" - were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. Had it been a voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course.

Malaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner's data communications systems - the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System - had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.

However, Amhad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS - which gives plane performance and maintenance information - came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.

19.35 Some in North Waziristan are looking at whoever is behind the missing MH370 plane with green eyes.

"We wish we had an opportunity to hijack such a plane," said an unnamed Pakistani Taliban official by telephone.

19.10 News agency AFP has produced a good video graphic explainer of MH370

18.42 Useful Telegraph graphic on what we do know about missing Flight MH370:

18.34 Anwar Ibrahim is the leader of Malaysia's opposition coalition. As William J Dobson writes in Slate:

A fanatical supporter of Anwar Ibrahim does sound scary—as long as you know nothing about him.

Anwar is the 66-year old opposition leader who is the principal thorn in the side of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) that has ruled Malaysia for 56 years. Anwar heads a coalition of parties, which includes his own multiethnic party, that has made the greatest inroads against the country’s corrupt masters. In 2008, the opposition won more than a third of the seats in parliament—the first time that UMNO lost its supermajority that allowed it to change the constitution at the prime minister’s whim. Anwar, who had been a political prisoner for six years, most of it in solitary confinement, won his seat in a landslide, and the opposition won five of the country’s 13 state governments. Last year, his opposition party claimed to have won the election against the ruling party, a contest that many say was marred by widespread fraud. Anwar supported the massive protests that followed the ruling party’s supposed victory, but he never called for a toppling of the government.

Anwar Ibrahim

18.20 Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's opposition leader, has stated he saw the pilot at party meetings but did not know him personally. It has been claimed by some news organisations that Captain Zaharie Shah was an "obsessive", "fanatical" supporter of Mr Anwar and could have hijacked MH370 in anger and protest at Mr Anwar's conviction for sodomy the day before the flight.

In an interview with the South China Morning Post. Mr Anwar said:

I don't recollect the name, but when the photographs were shown I remembered I had seen him at party meetings.

He doesn't hold positions in the party, but is an active member in the sense that he has been seen with the party's parliamentary leaders, taking photographs with them.

Mr Anwar added that Chinese criticism of Malaysia's handling of the crisis was "absolutely justified":

In this case, they lost their patience and came out with a stinging statement against the Malaysian government's lack of transparency.

It is absolutely understandable for the Chinese to express anger and even disgust.

Feeling angry is absolutely justified, especially with so many of its nationals on board.

18.09 Could the pilot have been trying to navigate to Langkawi after a fire on board knocked out the transponder and secondary radar tracking? Could this theory, put forward by a chap called Chris Goodfellow on Google Plus, be a rational explanation for Flight MH370?

The left turn is the key here. This was a very experienced senior Captain with 18,000 hours. Maybe some of the younger pilots interviewed on CNN didn't pick up on this left turn. We old pilots were always drilled to always know the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Airports behind us, airports abeam us and airports ahead of us. Always in our head. Always. Because if something happens you don't want to be thinking what are you going to do - you already know what you are going to do. Instinctively when I saw that left turn with a direct heading I knew he was heading for an airport. Actually he was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi a 13,000 foot strip with an approach over water at night with no obstacles. He did not turn back to Kuala Lampur because he knew he had 8,000 foot ridges to cross. He knew the terrain was friendlier towards Langkawi and also a shorter distance.

17.51 The missing Flight MH370 lacks satisfactory facts and has sparked endless theories, but everyone is still obsessed. Michael Wolff of the Guardian says the story is the new anti-journalism:

Well, the plane is somewhere. Although there exists the eerie possibility that it will remain as if nowhere – forever lost.

And that’s just about the best situation that exists for journalism: “missing” stories trump all others for their intensity and stickiness, fueling the imagination of journalists and audiences alike.

Journalism exists to provide information. But what’s really compelling is a lack of information – or what is more particularly being called “an absence of empirical data”.

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson in The Telegraph writes the baffling story of a vanished airliner has focused the world’s attention like no other:

And on it goes. I have never known anything like it. Think of the agony of those poor relatives. They are not only enduring the disappearance of 239 passengers and crew aboard the Malaysian airliner. They must also put up with the continuing pain of not knowing.

... It is not just the biggest whodunnit we have ever seen. It is a whydunnit and indeed a whodunwhat. This is a world in which we thought that they could see everything: whether through CCTV or looking at your internet account or tracking your movements by the signal of your mobile phone. Now we learn that it is still a world so vast that an object as unmistakeable as a Boeing 777 – 200ft long, 200ft broad and six storeys high – can vanish into the wide blue yonder.

17.05 Could MH370 have landed safely? The Telegraph's Rob Crilly states that while facts about what has happened to the Malaysia Airlines flight are in short supply, theories are not:

Could the airliner have landed somewhere, was it hijacked by remote control or did one of the pilots use the Boeing 777 as part of a one-man political protest or suicide?

Each one sounds outlandish but the truth – whenever it finally comes to light – could be equally strange.

Investigators seem increasingly certain it was flown off course by someone with expert knowledge of Boeing 777 planes.

Satellite data indicate it could have travelled in two possible directions, either to the south across the Indian Ocean or to the north, perhaps as far as Kazakhstan.

After that comes speculation, not helped by confusing and contradictory accounts given by official bodies.

The uncertainty and possible locations the plane could have flown to provide fertile ground for conspiracy theorists. The theory that the plane could have landed has also given relatives of passengers and crew renewed hope.

16.31 The search area for Flight MH370 is now up to 30 million square miles, according to several estimates. The leader of one of the Malaysia search missions, Captain Fareq Hassan, said:

This is not just a needle in a haystack, it’s a haystack that gets bigger and shifts under us due to the (ocean’s) drift.

16.10 MH370 is not the only plane to go missing without a trace. Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501 disappeared between New york City and seattle in 1950:

Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501 disappeared on June 24, 1950

15.22 Reports that the Chinese government issued strict guideleines to media not to analyse missing flight MH370 or do any independent reporting. China Digital Times has published the apparent message:

The media may not independently analyse or comment on the lost Malaysia Airlines flight. Related coverage must strictly accord with authoritative information issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China and with Xinhua News Agency wire copy. The domestic aviation department can promptly provide related information to passengers’ family members. All media must refrain from interviewing family members without permission, and must not incite any discontented sentiment.

15.15 The Hindu's Beijing correspondent speculates that China may be changing its critical atittude towards Kulala Lumpur over its handling of the crisis:

14.50 Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are seeking to oust foreign troops and set up an Islamic state, said the missing plane had nothing to do with them.

"It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went," he said. "So we also do not have any information as it is an external issue."

A commander with the Pakistani Taliban, a separate entity fighting the Pakistani government, said the fragmented group could only dream about such an operation.

"We wish we had an opportunity to hijack such a plane," he told Reuters by telephone from the lawless North Waziristan region.

14.41 As the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines jet continues to baffle investigators, our travel team looks at other famous aviation mysteries:

The pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 while attempting to circumnavigate the globe. Various reasons have been given for her disappearance. Some claim she was a spy, and that she was shot down and captured by Japanese forces; some believe she faked her own death; and a few even claim she was abducted by aliens. Last year researchers claimed they had discovered remnants of her aircraft using sonar readings.

14.12 It would have been "extremely difficult" to fly Flight MH370 at 5,000 feet if it reached the mountainous areas in the Himalayan vicinity, over northern India, Pakistan, or elsewhere in that region, a 777 flight simulator operator tells CNN.

"It would be extremely treacherous, very difficult to control, especially hard to do at night," said Mitchell Casado, operator of a flight simulator in Mississauga, Ontario.

At that height it would have seemed as though the jet was almost flying into the tree tops or mountain side and would have sounded extremely loud on the ground and disconcerting for passengers aboard.

Mr Casado's assessment adds to the puzzling notion that the Malaysia Airlines flight could have continued for hours at low altitude without anyone in the air or on the ground raising the alarm.

14.02 Malaysian authorities confirm that it was the co-pilot who was the last to speak to the ground before the flight vanished between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace and confirm they are widening the search.

13.28 A leader of the Malaysian opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, of which the captain of MH370 was a strong supporter, has said that members of his political alliance were willing to change places with all 239 passengers and crew if it emerged the plane had been hijacked.

Mahfuz Omar, MP, said:

Our concern now is the safety of the passengers. I am willing to exchange places with the passengers and become a hostage if the need arises.

13.09 The Malay Mail reports that three French investigators involved in the Air France 447 disaster have arrived in Malaysia to help authorities with missing flight MH370. Air France 447 was lost five years ago in the Atlantic Ocean as it flew from Rio to France. The Malaysian transport ministry said in a statement:

The officials will share their expertise and knowledge based on their experience from the search for Air France Flight 447.

Cambodian residents light candles as they pray for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 at their village in Phnom Penh

12.42 Now this is possibly my favourite theory so far.

Did MH 370 switch off its radar, then "shadow" another plane - flying from Singapore to Barcelona - and land north of India or in Afghanistan?

It sounds crazy, but Keith Ledgerwood, an aviation enthusiast, has produced these charts.

It became apparent as I inspected SIA68’s flight path history that MH370 had maneuvered itself directly behind SIA68 at approximately 17:00UTC and over the next 15 minutes had been following SIA68. All the pieces of my theory had been fitting together with the facts that have been publically released and I began to feel a little uneasy.

12.40 Further detail from Kazakhstan's assertion (see 12.28) that there were no unidentified planes detected over its airspace.

ALMATY, March 17 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan said on Monday it had not detected any "unsanctioned use" of its air space by any planes on March 8, making it unlikely that a missing Malaysia Arlines jetliner could have been diverted along a northern route via Thailand.

Malaysia Airlines MASM.KL Flight MH370, which vanished with 239 people aboard, could hypothetically have reached the Central Asian nation's air space, but it would have been detected there, the Kazakh Civil Aviation Committee said in a detailed statement sent to Reuters.

Malaysia Airlines planes had made nine regular flights to and from Europe over Kazakhstan's territory on March 8, it said.

12.31 An interesting analysis from The New York Times here.

The government added to the confusion about what happened during those key minutes by withdrawing its assertion that the radio signoff came after a crucial communications system was disabled.

The new description of what happened to the Acars system appeared to reopen the possibility that the aircraft was operating normally until the transponder ceased sending signals two minutes after the last radio message. The new uncertainty could also raise additional questions about whether the plane was deliberately diverted or whether it suffered mechanical or electrical difficulties that crippled its communications and resulted in its flying an aberrant course.

12.21 New developments from India.

Salman Khurshid, the foreign minister, has been asked about the theory that the plane was hijacked as a possible "9/11 style" attack on India.

I don’t think we have gone that far.

The Times of India said security sources had “rubbished” the idea that the plane could have got anywhere close to an urban centre and insisted it would have been detected by a naval base on the Andaman islands, more than 600 miles off the Indian mainland.

12.17 Malaysia Airlines has decided to rename Flight MH 370 as Flight MH 318, as a mark of respect.

The route, from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, remains unchanged.

Reuters photographer Edgar Su boarded the flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 17 and documented the journey to Beijing.

11.59 Much has been made over the weekend of Capt Shah's support for Anwar Ibrahim, the imprisoned opposition leader.

The pilot was described variously as being "fanatical", "obsessed" and a "fervent" supporter of Mr Ibrahim.

But this article in Slate magazine is well worth reading, to give a bit of perspective.

William Dobson, Slate's politics and foreign affairs editor writes:

There is an axiom in Malaysian politics: Eventually everything comes back to Anwar Ibrahim. So, the longer that the fumbling and inept investigation into the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has gone on, the more certain it became that it would somehow boomerang to the leader of the country’s democratic opposition.

He concludes:

Zaharie Ahmad Shah supported Anwar Ibrahim. That’s common sense, not zealotry.

11.55 Our correspondent in Kuala Lumpur, Jonathan Pearlman, has sent the following update from Malaysia.

Malaysia Airlines revealed the plane’s co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, was the last person to communicate to the ground from the cockpit, apparently after the communications system was shut off. So far, nothing suspicious about his background – he was 27 and apparently planning to marry his pilot girlfriend. Trying to find out more on him tonight.

Meanwhile, Malaysia has “narrowed” the search to two enormous corridors – a northern one spreading from Myanmar to Uzbekistan, and a southern one spreading across Australia and Indonesia. Malaysian authorities say no terrorists have claimed responsibility and reports that the plane flew low now appear to be wrong.

11.41 As the search for the plane enters its tenth day, with still no sign of the plane nor wreckage, the number of theories as to its fate is growing.

• Has the plane been flown to a Taliban base?

After numerous theories of a possible sea crash, hijack and pilot suicide, Malaysian authorities are seeking diplomatic permission to scrutinize Taliban-controlled bases on the borders of Afghanistan and North West Pakistan, the Independent reports.

• Was the plane 'cyber hijacked', using a mobile phone?

A mobile phone or a USB stick could have been used by a hacker to potentially change the plane's altitude, speed and direction by sending radio signals to its flight management system.

Was it possible for hackers to get into main computer network of the plane through the in-flight, on-board entertainment system? Whoever was responsible for the plane's disappearance likely has a 'very sophisticated systems engineering understanding'.

• Did the pilot or co-pilot hijack the plane?

Captain Zaharie Ahmed Shah is reported to have been a supporter of Malaysia's opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, who was sent to prison for five years just hours before the plane disappeared.

Capt Shah's wife and three children moved out of the family home the day before the plane disappeared.

Captain Zaharie Ahmed Shah, pilot of Flight MH 370

11.31 AFP news agency have added more detail to this morning's new development - that the co pilot spoke the final known words from the cockpit.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 17, 2014 (AFP) - The last words spoken from the cockpit of the Malaysian passenger jet that went missing 10 days ago were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot, the airline's top executive said Monday.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a news briefing.

The last message from the cockpit - "All right, good night" - came around the time that two of the missing plane's crucial signalling systems were switched off.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid have become a primary focus of the investigation into the fate of Flight 370, with one of the key questions being who was controlling the aircraft when the communications systems were disabled.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's seemingly nonchalant final words.

ACARS transmits key information on a plane's condition to the ground.

The plane's transponder - which relays radar information on the plane's location - was switched off just two minutes after the voice message.

11.18 The Wall St Journal has pointed out that the search for the missing plane is hampered by the fact that the search area includes some of the highest and lowest points on earth.

The northern corridor includes mountainous terrain that reaches up to around 20,000 feet (6,096 meters), and crosses the borders of countries such as China and Kazakhstan. The southern corridor, apart from a small corner of Indonesia, traverses nothing but ocean. It includes an ocean trench that is deeper than the Tibetan Plateau on the northerly corridor is tall.

Both areas will present considerably difficulties to search parties looking for Flight 370.

11.02 Authorities in Malaysia now seem convinced that flight MH 370 was hijacked. By who, we don't yet know - although evidence suggests that someone with a good understanding of flight controls and radar systems was in charge.

This article from Wired magazine, exploring how and why planes are hijacked, offers an interesting overview.

On one level, it's comforting to think that a hijacker of MH370 was not bent on using the plane as a weapon of mass destruction, but rather wanted to start life anew somewhere else. But it's also frightening to imagine a world where, as in the early 1970s, the desperate and deluded increasingly start to view hijacking as a reasonable solution to their problems.

10.46 The Reuters news agency have produced this timeline of what we know so far.

- 0041: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 departs from Kuala Lumpur International Airport and is due to land in Beijing at 0630 the same day. On board the Boeing 777-200ER are 227 passengers and 12 crew.

- 0107: After take-off and ascent, the plane sends its last ACARS transmission, which gives engine maintenance data to the ground. The system is later deactivated.

- 0119: Someone in the cockpit says "All right, good night" to Malaysian air traffic control. They were the last words heard from Flight MH370.

- 0121: The plane drops off air traffic control screens as its transponder - which responds to civilian radar - is switched off. The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam says the plane failed to check in as scheduled at 0121 with air traffic control in Ho Chi Minh City. Malaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off the plane's communications systems and turned it sharply to the west.

- 0215: Malaysian military radar plots Flight MH370 at a point south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca, hundreds of miles west of its last known location.

- 0811: The last signal received from the plane, according to satellite tracking data. The final communication placed the plane somewhere in one of two corridors: a northern arc stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern one stretching from Indonesia to the vast southern Indian Ocean.

10.32 Our Sydney correspondent, Jonathan Pearlman, is in Kuala Lumpur for us.

He brings us this summary of the press conference this morning:

At a daily press briefing, Malaysia Airlines head Ahmad Jauhari Yahya revealed that Fariq Abdul Hamid, the co-pilot of the missing MH370 flight, was the last person to communicate to the ground from the cockpit. This was apparently several minutes after the communications system was shut off.

However, Malaysian authorities have so far found nothing suspicious about the backgrounds of the pilot or co-pilot, a 27-year-old flying enthusiast who was reportedly planning to marry his long-time girlfriend, a fellow pilot.

Hishammuddin Hussein, the acting transport minister, confirmed that no terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the plane’s disappearance.

“The fact there are no distress signals, there are no ransom notes, there are no parties claiming responsibility – there is still hope.”

10.25 As confirmed by Malaysian authorities this morning, Australia is leading the search of the southern corridor.

Here's what Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, said about the search:

MH370: missing Malaysian Airlines flight is 'unfathomed mystery', says Tony Abbott

10.13 So what have we learnt from that press conference?

- The co pilot spoke the last words to Air Traffic Control; "All right, good night." When asked if the voice recording was being analysed for stress, the authorities said that was part of the investigation and they couldn't comment.

- The last ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) transmittion from the plane was at 1.07am

- 26 countries are now involved in the search, which spans the border of 11 countries.

- The search has been divided into two corridors, a northern and southern one. The northern one runs from Laos to the Caspian Sea; the southern one from Sumatra into the Indian Ocean.

- Authorities defended their handling of the crisis.

- Malaysia says it is unaware of reports that the plane flew at 5,000ft to avoid radar detection.

10.12 The press conference has just finished.

10.11 Hishammuddin Hussein is saying:

We have to be very responsible with the statements we make, and think about the suffering of the families.

10.06 The authorities are being asked whether the plane was flying at 5,000ft.

We are not aware of that report. It doesn't come from us.

Read more on that claim here:

Missing Malaysia plane flew at 5,000ft and used 'terrain masking' to avoid radar detection

10.02 The Malaysian authorities are explaining how they calculate the size of the two search corridors.

For the northern corridor, if the aircraft was travelling at minimum speed, it went to Laos. At maximum speed it would have reached the Caspian Sea.

For the southern route; the minimum speed would have taken it west of Sumatra. At maximum speed, it would have reached the south of the Indian Ocean.

As you can appreciate, the area involved is huge. We are trying to narrow this.

That is why countries which have satellites or assets on the ground are being contacted.

09.59 The Malaysian team are asked: "Do you believe that the person who said 'All right, good night' was the pilot or the co pilot?"

We believe it was the co pilot.

They are then asked if the voice recording has been analysed for stress.

The Malysian officials say they cannot reveal that, as it is part of the investigation.

09.52 Mr Hussein says that they are going through the passenger list again, to check for any suspicious behaviour among passengers.

But as yet they have not found anything.

09.48 Hishammuddin Hussein, the Malaysian transport minister, is being asked about the security checks performed on the pilot before he was permitted to fly.

He says they were standard, but are currently being reviewed.

Going forward, we will obviously look into this, and see if we can strengthen or tighten the requirements.

We are now on "Code Tango", which means a heightened security environment. Extra precautions are currently being taken.

09.45 Interesting to note that French investigators have been invited to assist the search.

Remember they spent two years searching for the wreckage of the Air France plane which crashed over the Atlantic in June 2009.

Our Washington correspondent, Raf Sanchez, has had a look at how the Malaysia Airlines disappearance compares to other tragedies.

In the search for Air France 447, an Airbus 330 flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, the first signs of wreckage were found a day after the crash.

The Air France Airbus also sent automated warning messages to its manufacturer as it began to go out of control in 2009. Boeing does not appear to have received any similar messages from its 777, leaving no clues of its fate.

Malaysia Airlines disappearance: how does it compare to other air tragedies?

09.42 Malaysia's transport minister is now taking questions.

China, India and Pakistan have said that the plane did not enter their air space.

Indonesian officials say it hasn't crossed their territory either.

09.40 Hishammuddin Hussein says that the search has been "recalibrated" over the past few days - into a northern and a southern corridor.

He said the Australians are taking control of the southern corridor.

He also held up two maps showing the new search areas. We'll bring you those when we get them.

09.35 Hishammuddin Hussein, the transport minister, continues:

As soon as we verified and corroborated the information, we recalibrated the search corridors, as stated by the Prime Minister.

Malaysia Airlines has set up operations centres in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing. The airline gives daily briefings to the families.

09.33 Experts from China, France and Australia have joined the search, Mr Hussein says.

On Saturday March 8 we began investigations into all crew members.

On Sunday March 9 we visited the homes the pilot and co-pilot and spoke to their families.

We visited the homes again on Saturday March 16 and took away the pilot's flight simulator.

09.32 The Malaysian transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, is giving a press conference now.

He says 26 countries are now involved in the search.

09.31 For a recap of all yesterday's developments, you can see our live coverage here:

Malaysian Airlines MH370: March 16 as it happened

09.30 Good morning and welcome to The Telegraph's live coverage of the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370.###253||Empty###254||Mark Carney has been forced to admit that allegations of rigging in foreign exchange markets could prove be a bigger scandal than the manipulation of Libor as he sought to rebuff criticism that the Bank of England had been slow to react.

During almost five hours in front of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday, Carney also unveiled plans for a new deputy governor to focus on banking and markets as part of an overhaul to bolster the Bank's credibility. He also told MPs the Royal Bank of Scotland may have to move its headquarters to England if Scotland voted for independence in September.

Carney was speaking just days after the Bank suspended a member of staff in connection with its review of the £3 trillion a day foreign exchange market and began a formal inquiry into whether its staff knew about potential market rigging.

Facing renewed criticism from the committee's chair, Andrew Tyrie, that the Bank's governance structure was "opaque, complex and byzantine", Carney said a strategic review to be outlined next week would reinforce compliance, make staff more accountable and create the post of a fourth deputy governor.

The Bank was "ruthlessly and relentlessly" investigating what had happened in foreign exchange markets and "intensively cooperating" with other central banks around the world, he added. But the governor sought to lay much of the blame at the feet of certain market players who "have lost sight of what a real market is".

He told MPs: "This is a very serious matter that has to be chased down as rapidly and fairly as possible. This is as serious as Libor, if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets.

"We cannot come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England."

The scandal escalated on Tuesday as Bloomberg news agency reported a senior currency dealer at Lloyds Banking Group tipped off a trader at oil company BP about a £300m foreign exchange deal. Bloomberg, which first broke news of allegations of price rigging in forex markets last June, cited people with knowledge of the matter saying the Lloyds's dealer, Martin Chantree, alerted the other trader on 31 January 2013 that his desk had received instructions from the bank's treasury department to swap more than £300m for dollars and that they would continue selling regardless of price movements. Lloyds suspended Chantree last month.

Experts say the foreign exchange scandal could have huge implications for London as a global financial centre.

Carney's repeated vows to reinforce integrity follow a warning from one of the Treasury committee's MPs, Labour's Pat McFadden, that the Bank faced "enormous" risks to it reputation from reports of wrongdoing in the foreign exchange market, where London accounts for 40% of the trade.

The governor's comments did little to allay Tyrie's concerns about the Bank's ability to cope with a new crisis. "This is the first real test for the Bank of England's new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging," the MP said in a statement after the hearing. He reiterated criticism of the slowness of the Bank's oversight committee – made up of non-executive members of its governing body – to take the lead on accusations of misconduct in the forex markets. An internal inquiry was launched in October when the allegations were first made but the investigation was only moved up to the oversight committee last week.

"The public needs confidence that the Bank's governance structures will ensure that it gets to the bottom of forex-related misconduct allegations. The public also needs confidence that any misconduct in other areas will be discovered," Tyrie said.

The committee's Andrea Leadsom repeated several times a question to Paul Fisher, the Bank's executive director for markets over why Threadneedle Street did not once deign to follow up the committee's queries in the wake of the Libor scandal over whether other prices may have been rigged.

She quoted from minutes from 2006 meetings between the Bank and its chief dealers subgroup, which noted "evidence of attempts to move the market" at certain times and said that should have set bells ringing. "It goes back to this complacency that all will be fine," Leadsom said to Fisher.

But Fisher said: "Those minutes did not convey to me that markets were being rigged."

On the question of being spurred into further investigations, Fisher said: "It isn't our job to go out hunting for rigging of markets."

The hearing also covered the Bank's move last month to overhaul its forward guidance policy, under which it seeks to provide assurance over when interest rates will begin to rise. Renewed divisions between members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) were revealed over the size of the so-called "output gap", the difference between the actual level of activity in the economy and its potential level.

Tyrie was visibly shocked when questions about MPC discussions led to the revelation that recordings of the monthly meetings were destroyed once they had been turned into redacted minutes.

He argued that recordings were of significant historical value, as seen in the US where the Federal Reserve's open market committee publishes full transcripts with a long time lag. He was reluctant to accept Fisher's explanation that previous attempts to transcribe meetings had failed. "Is that because you are all shouting and throwing things at one another? Most organisations manage to transcribe a record, even the House of Commons manages to do it on a good day."###255||Bank of England governor Mark Carney says regulation could be needed for the foreign exchange markets in the wake of rate rigging allegations.

Speaking to the Treasury select committee today, Carney said he acted swiftly when he heard allegations that the Bank of England had condoned trader manipulation.

Last week, the Bank of England suspended a member of staff over allegations the individual allowed traders to manipulate the market.

TSC chair Andrew Tyrie has accused the Bank’s “Byzantine” structure of making it difficult to hold staff to account.

Carney first knew about the allegations last October but defended the subsequent secret investigation and redacted minutes of board meetings.

The FCA is conducting a thematic review of firms’ execution practices, including the way services are described to clients and arrangements for order execution and review. It expects to publish the results by the end of June.

Carney said the FCA and Bank would consider if ”regulatory changes” are needed in the foreign exchange market.

Bank of England executive director of markets Paul Fisher, who was head of foreign exchange at the Bank until 2009, launched a robust defence of the Bank’s role.

He said: “I have never come across specific allegations of people rigging the market until this news last year. The allegations are about the traders themselves. It would have been very odd to come to meetings with us and say ‘we are rigging the markets, what do you think?’ That’s not going to happen.

“This is about traders whingeing about how difficult their life is and we didn’t have much sympathy. Later, we got into more technical discussions about how the fixes are constructed. We brought the market and fix makers together so there was improved understanding.”

In July 2012, former deputy governor Paul Tucker was accused by Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond of condoning Libor rigging to calm financial markets during the crisis. The TSC report proved inconclusive over whether regulators had given their blessing over the alleged lowballing.###256||Global equities suffered and commodities including copper and crude dropped, as unexpectedly weak Chinese trade data upset investors already tense over the ongoing standoff in Ukraine.

The Stoxx Europe 600 was trading 0.22% lower against a backdrop of downbeat Chinese export numbers and general global uncertainty.

Merger activity in France spurred the CAC 40 but mining firms sensitive to China's demand for raw materials weighed on the UK's FTSE 100. Elsewhere, German firms' exposure to Russia saw the Dax underperform again.

Data from China showed that exports surprisingly dropped 18% year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit, triggering fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Market players in Asia exercised caution.

Copper and Crude

Chinese data pulled three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7% to $6,663.75 a metric ton (7345.5 tons). It earlier slid to $6,608 a ton, its weakest since June 2013, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010, reported Reuters.

Chinese data also forced Brent and US crude down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two consecutive days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya contained the falls.

Meanwhile, spot gold shed 0.4% to $1,334.50 an ounce at 10:35GMT, while US gold futures for delivery in April dropped $3.20 an ounce to $1,335.00.

"The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure," Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London told Reuters.

Standard Chartered said in a note to clients: "We believe China's official import data is partly inflated by commodity-financing activity. There is a sharp difference between strong imports of copper and China's moderating PMI over the past three months.

"This divergence is explained by trading companies importing copper (and some other commodities such as iron ore and coal) using letters of credit (LCs) issued by onshore banks."

"The commodities may then be sold in the domestic market (with the proceeds lent in the informal credit markets) or used as collateral to borrow more bank funding," Standard Chartered added.

Barclays Capital said in a note to clients: "We expect the China's trade balance to turn positive in the coming months although the monthly surplus will come down from the average of $30bn in Q4 2013 (Jan-Feb: 4.4bn, Q1 2013: 14bn), as 'hot money' inflows disguised in the trade flows being are squeezed out.

"Overall, we expect continued trade and current account surplus and net inflows under the capital account with the latter being controlled by the PBoC with its capital account opening measures. We believe this should support a modest appreciation of the CNY against the USD although at a slower pace than the 2.8% in 2013."

Standard Chartered said in a separate note: "We maintain our China's GDP growth forecast for 2014 unchanged at 7.4%. Q1 GDP is likely to come in at 7.6%. Premier Li has made it clear that some economic growth is necessary for carrying out reforms and that Beijing will support growth when needed, but mentioned that the trade data was not so bad as to trigger a shift in policy."

"The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility," Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight told the news agency.

A sensuous, clear design, a sporty interior with high-class appeal and a generous sense of space, the lightest body shell in the segment, economical and lively engines, efficiency benchmarks, extensive safety features, a new agile and comfortable suspension as well as a host of other innovations create the impression of an upgrade to a higher class of vehicle.

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a sensuous and clear design and offers a host of technical innovations as well as a comprehensive scope of standard equipment, and exemplary emissions and fuel consumption figures. This all adds up to substantial added value and long-term savings on motor vehicle tax and at the filling station.

Production of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class starts in four locations and on four continents within the span of four months: in Bremen (Germany), East London (South Africa), Beijing (China) and for the first time also in Tuscaloosa (Alabama, USA).

New dimensions

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class offers new dimensions with regard to technology, ecology, comfort, high-class appeal and fun at the wheel – and equally regarding the sense of space. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class has grown to take account of people’s increasing average height. With an 80-millimetre increase in the wheelbase (2840 milli­metres) compared with the previous model, the vehicle is 95 millimetres longer (4686 millimetres) and 40 millimetres wider (1810 millimetres). The resulting increase in space benefits the rear-seat passengers, who now travel in even more comfort, and creates room for the new front axle and future hybrid components. At 480 litres the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class also surpasses its predecessor in terms of boot capacity (in accordance with ISO 3832).

In some measurements the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class even approaches or surpasses the E‑Class model series that made design history in 1995 with its distinctive four-headlamp look. Wheelbase, track and width are actually larger while many interior dimensions are on about the same level. This growth spurt benefits first and foremost comfort. What is more, the bare figures substantiate that the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class Saloon also provides the measurable and not purely subjective benefits of an “upgrade to a higher class of vehicle” thanks to high-quality appointments and innovative technology.

Mercedes-Benz C-Class predecessor (W 204) The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W 205) 1995 E-Class (W 210) Wheelbase mm 2760 2840 2833 Track front/rear mm 1547/1547 1588/1570 1542/1536 Length mm 4591 4686 4795 Width mm 1770 1810 1799 Height mm 1447 1442 1433 Elbow room front mm 1440 1454 1452 Elbow room rear mm 1462 1462 1472

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class sets visual highlights with a striking, dynamic design that exudes sensuous clarity while arousing emotions at the same time. Customers can choose from two fronts – sporty with a central star or – reserved solely for the EXCLUSIVE line – the classic Saloon grille with the Mercedes star on the bonnet, which puts particular emphasis on the status and reputation of the Saloon. The interior spaciously and stylishly showcases straightforward sportiness and aesthetic elegance with high-quality materials and finely crafted details worthy of the luxury class with surprising new design ideas. In addition to the base model, there are also three distinct design and equipment lines each for the exterior and interior.

With regard to technical features the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class surpasses its successful predecessor in many areas and sets a multitude of new benchmarks in its segment besides. With an aluminium content of 48 percent and up to 100 kilograms lighter the Saloon is the lightweight-design leader in its segment. Other benchmarks: 99 grammes of CO2 emissions for the C 180 BlueTEC and the C 200 BlueTEC (preliminary figures); for the C 300 BlueTEC HYBRID 94 grammes of CO2 emissions as well as a Cd value of 0.24.

Among the outstanding characteristics of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class are also the best ride comfort – especially with first-ever AIRMATIC air suspension in this segment – the best NVH figures (noise, vibration, harshness) for comfort and driver-fitness safety, the best wind noise index, the most advanced and extensive assistance systems, innovative technology with multifunctional touchpad, head-up display, and GPS-controlled climate comfort. The outstanding safety substantiates the high standards which Mercedes-Benz as a safety pioneer also satisfies in the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class – it not only garners benchmarks in all national ratings around the world, but also meets the even more demanding Mercedes in-house requirements, which even more precisely reflect what actually happens in real-life accidents.

Mercedes-Benz C-Class customers will have a choice of three versions of the standard-specification steel suspension, which also includes a very sporty set-up. As an alternative Mercedes-Benz for the first time offers an air suspension in this segment. The AIRMATIC air suspension manages to bridge the gap between a high level of ride comfort and dynamic-agile handling.

Efficient and lively engines

Powerful and efficient petrol and diesel engines, all equipped with the ECO start/stop function and complying with Euro 6 emissions standards, provide for lively performance and great fun at the wheel. They are also a factor in cutting fuel consumption by up to 20 percent compared with the preceding model. Among them is also a new small four-cylinder diesel engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres. Low weight, compact design and low specific fuel consumption are among its special merits.

Five four-cylinder petrol engines with power outputs ranging from 115 to 180 kW (156 to 245 hp) will initially be available for the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class. There is also the C 180 BlueEFFICIENCY Edition special model, which with ECO Technology package qualifies for efficiency class A. A six-cylinder petrol engine rated at 245 kW (333 hp) and the four-cylinder C 350 HYBRID with plug-in technology and a power output of 150 + 20 kW (204 + 27 hp) will follow in due course.

The diesel models of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class are powered by the further enhanced four-cylinder or the new small four-cylinder engine, which as BlueTEC models are all equipped with SCR technology (selective catalytic reduction). They cover an output range from 85 kW (115 hp) to 150 kW (204 hp). The C 220 BlueTEC is optionally also available with an output of 120 kW (163 hp) as a special model with ECO Technology package.

In addition, Mercedes-Benz offers a diesel engine combined with a hybrid module. The C 300 BlueTEC HYBRID with four-cylinder diesel engine and compact electric motor generates an output of 150 + 20 kW (204 + 27 hp) and despite its high power output runs on just 3.6 litres of diesel per 100 km/h in NEDC combined mode (equivalent to 94 grammes of CO2).

As is customary, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class will also be available with a modern 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system starting in September 2014.

All diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz C-Class models are classified at least as efficiency class A, most of them even as efficiency class A+. The only exceptions are the 4MATIC models C 220 BlueTEC 4MATIC and C 250 BlueTEC 4MATIC, which are classified as efficiency class B.###260||A US official said a Malaysia Airlines plane was sending signals to a satellite for four hours after the aircraft went missing, an indication that it was still flying.

The official said the Boeing 777-200 wasn't transmitting data to the satellite, but sending out a signal to establish contact. Boeing offers a satellite service that can receive a stream of data during flight on how the aircraft is functioning.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to speak publicly, said Malaysia Airlines didn't subscribe to that service, but the system was automatically pinging the satellite anyway.

The official also said some messages involving a different data service were received for a short time after the plane's transponder went silent.

Satellites picked up "pings" from Malaysia jet



Communications satellites picked up faint electronic pulses from Airlines Flight 370 after it went missing on Saturday, but the signals gave no information about where the stray jet was heading and little else about its fate, two sources close to the investigation said on Thursday.

The "pings" indicated that the aircraft's maintenance troubleshooting systems were switched on and ready to communicate with satellites as needed. But no data links were opened because the companies involved had not subscribed to that level of service from the satellite operator, the sources said.

The system transmits such pings about once an hour, the sources said, but it remains unclear how many signals the plane sent after air traffic control lost track of it.

Boeing Co, which made the missing 777 airliner, and Rolls-Royce, which supplied its Trent engines, declined to comment.

Earlier Malaysian officials denied reports that the aircraft had continued to send technical data and said there was no evidence that it flew for hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers early Saturday after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to .

had reported that U.S. aviation investigators and national security officials believed the flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from its engines as part of a standard monitoring program.

Sources familiar with the investigation reiterated that neither Boeing nor Rolls-Royce had received any engine maintenance data from the jet after the point at which its pilots last made contact. Only one engine maintenance update was received during the normal phase of flight, they said, speaking on condition on anonymity.

That said, the latest evidence of an electronic whisper from the plane, extending an electronic handshake to satellites but containing no data, suggests the aircraft was at least capable of communicating, though nothing else is known about its situation or whereabouts.

There is still no evidence that demonstrates the plane's disappearance was related to foul play, U.S. security sources stressed, though the officials said they still have not ruled out the possibility of terrorism.

Reuters reported on Monday that the aircraft had made no automatic contact with the ground after vanishing with 239 people on board.

Modern aircraft can communicate with airline operations bases and sometimes with the headquarters of its manufacturers automatically in order to send maintenance alerts known as ACARS messages. It was this system that sent out the regular ping, which may have lasted for several hours, the sources said.

Airlines can also subscribe to an expanded service that collects more data about the performance of the aircraft and sends it back to maintenance control rooms at the airline and Boeing.

But had not signed up for Boeing's Airplane Health Management system, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week.

A new search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean as authorities try to determine what happened to a missing Malaysian airliner, the White House said on Thursday.

"It's my understanding that based on some new information that's not necessarily conclusive - but new information - an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney said. "And we are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy."



No engine data after plane went missing, says Malaysia



Officials dismissed reports on Thursday that the missing Malaysian airliner's engines continued sending data for hours after its last contact, but said it was possible the plane continued flying and that they would widen their search farther to the west.

The Wall Street Journal newspaper quoted U.S. investigators on Thursday as saying they suspected the Boeing 777 remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane's engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both had said the last engine data was received at 1:07 a.m., before the plane lost contact over the South China Sea on its way to Beijing.

An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea and also the Strait of Malacca because of unconfirmed military radar sightings indicating the plane may have changed course and headed west after it stopped communicating.

Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said, "of course, this is why we have extended the search."

He said the search had been expanded into the Andaman Sea and that the country was asking for radar data from neighboring countries. If the plane flew far from current search areas, then locating it will be a much harder task.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the disappearance of the plane and the 239 people on board.

India To Deploy Helicopters, Ships In Malaysian Jet Search

PORT BLAIR: India's defense ministry instructed the joint command on the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Thursday to deploy ships, aircraft and helicopters to search for a missing Malaysian airliner, a command spokesman Harmeet Singh told Reuters.

The armed forces will hold a meeting on Thursday evening to decide how to coordinate their search efforts with other countries, after which they will make deployments, a senior command officer said.

US investigators suspect missing Malaysian plane flew for hours

US investigators suspect that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 stayed in the air for about four hours past the time it reached its last confirmed location, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing two people familiar with the details.

The report comes as authorities remain uncertain about which ocean to search for the jetliner that went missing on Saturday after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.

It raises the possibility that the plane, and the 239 people on board, could have flown on for hundreds of additional miles under conditions that remain murky, the newspaper reported.

The last definitive sighting of the aircraft on civilian radar screens came shortly before 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, as it flew northeast across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand bound for Beijing.

Malaysian aviation chief says no plane debris found at spot shown by China's satellite images

Malaysia's civil aviation chief says no signs of the missing Malaysian jetliner have been found at a location where Chinese satellite images have shown what might be plane debris.

Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman says planes searched the location Thursday. "There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing," he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

Vietnamese officials previously said the area had already been "searched thoroughly" in recent days.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by false leads since it disappeared with 239 people aboard just hours after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday.

The plane was heading east over the South China Sea when it disappeared, but authorities believe it may have turned back and headed into the upper reaches of the Malacca Strait or beyond.

A search by two Vietnamese aircraft responding to information provided by a Chinese satellite has failed to locate objects suspected of being wreckage from a missing Malaysian airliner, a Reuters journalist on board a search plane said on Thursday.

Aircraft repeatedly circled the area over the South China Sea but were unable to detect any objects, said the journalist, who flew aboard a Antonov 26 cargo plane for three hours.

Vietnamese and Malaysian planes were scanning waters where a Chinese government agency website said a satellite had photographed three "suspicious floating objects" on Sunday.

The location was close to where the plane lost contact with air traffic control.

Search planes checking China satellite report on missing jet

Search planes were flying on Thursday to an area where a Chinese satellite has seen objects that could be debris from the Malaysian airliner missing for almost six days, but those waters had been checked before and nothing found, officials said.

At the same time, China heaped pressure on Malaysia to improve its coordination over the search for the Malaysia Airlines plane, which disappeared early on Saturday on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Of the 239 people on board, up to 154 were Chinese.

Premier Li Keqiang, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, demanded that the "relevant party" step up coordination while China's civil aviation chief said he wanted a "smoother" flow of information from Malaysia, which has come under heavy criticism for its handling of the disaster.

Must Read - Missing plane: Unsolved mysteries of aviation history



Vietnamese and Malaysian planes would scan waters where a Chinese government agency website said a satellite had photographed three "suspicious floating objects" on Sunday. The location was close to where the plane lost contact with air traffic control.

"We are aware and we sent planes to cover that area over the past three days," Vietnamese Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu told Reuters. "Today a CASA plane will search the area again," he said, referring to a twin-turboprop military aircraft.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on his Twitter feed: "Malaysia Maritime Enforcement Agency Bombardier has already been dispatched to investigate alleged claims of debris being found by Chinese satellite imagery."

China's civil aviation chief, Li Jiaxiang, said there was no proof that the objects in the South China Sea were connected to the missing aircraft.

One U.S. official close to the plane investigation also said the Chinese satellite report was a "red herring."

It was the latest in scores of often confusing leads for a multi-national search team that has been combing 27,000 square nautical miles (93,000 square km), an area the size of Hungary, for the Boeing 777-200ER.

On Wednesday, Malaysia's air force chief said military radar had traced what could have been the jetliner to an area south of the Thai holiday island of Phuket, hundreds of miles to the west of its last known position.

His statement followed a series of conflicting accounts of the flight path of the plane, which left authorities uncertain even which ocean to search in for Flight MH370.

The last definitive sighting on civilian radar screens came shortly before 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, less than an hour after the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur, as it flew northeast across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand.

What happened next remains one of the most baffling mysteries in modern aviation history and the differing accounts put out by various Malaysian officials have drawn criticism of their handling of the crisis.

"The Malaysians deserve to be criticized - their handling of this has been atrocious," said Ernest Bower, a Southeast Asia specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Rodzali Daud, the Malaysian air force chief, told a news conference on Wednesday that an aircraft was plotted on military radar at 2:15 a.m., 200 miles (320 km) northwest of Penang Island off Malaysia's west coast at the northern tip of the Strait of Malacca.

But there has been no confirmation that the unidentified plane was Flight MH370, Rodzali said, and Malaysia was sharing the data with international civilian and military authorities, including those from the United States.

"We are corroborating this," he added. "We are still working with the experts."

AGONISING WAIT

According to the data cited by Rodzali, if the radar had spotted the missing plane, the aircraft would have flown for 45 minutes and dropped only about 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) in altitude since its sighting on civilian radar in the Gulf of Thailand.

There was no word on which direction it was then headed, but if this sighting was correct, the plane would have turned sharply west from its original course, travelling hundreds of miles over the Malay Peninsula from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea.

This would put it about 200 miles northwest of Penang, in the northern part of the Strait of Malacca, roughly south of Phuket and east of the tip of Indonesia's Aceh province and India's Nicobar island chain.

Indonesia and Thailand have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace. Malaysia has asked India for help in tracing the aircraft and New Delhi's coast guard planes have joined the search.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement that its experts in air traffic control and radar who travelled to Kuala Lumpur over the weekend were giving the Malaysians technical help in the search.

A U.S. official in Washington said the experts were shown two sets of radar records, military and civilian, and they both appeared to show the plane turning to the west and across the Malay peninsula.

But the official stressed the records were raw data returns that were not definitive.

A dozen countries are taking part in the search, with 42 ships and 39 aircraft involved.

Authorities have not ruled out any possible cause for the plane's disappearance. Malaysian police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.

Two men on board were discovered by investigators to have false passports, but they were apparently seeking to emigrate illegally to the West.

The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 struck a seawall with its undercarriage on landing in San Francisco, killing three people.

Boeing Co, the U.S. aircraft company that makes the 777, has declined to comment beyond a brief statement saying it was monitoring the situation.



Vietnam to recheck area for missing plane after China spots debris



Vietnam has already searched the area where Chinese satellites showed objects that could be debris from a missing Malaysia Airlines jet but a plane has been sent to check the area again, Vietnamese military officials said.

"We are aware and we sent planes to cover that area over the past three days," Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu told Reuters. "Today a (military) plane will search the area again," he said.

Another military official said Vietnam was waiting to see photographs taken by a Chinese satellite on Sunday in waters northeast of Kuala Lumpur and south of Vietnam in order to identify the exact location for further inspection.###261||ADVERTISEMENT

NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks are closing slightly lower following disappointing economic news from China and Japan.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index edged down a point to close at 1,877 today. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418. The Nasdaq composite fell two points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.

Investors were discouraged by an 18 percent slump in Chinese exports last month, the latest sign of trouble for the world’s second-largest economy. Japan lowered its estimate for fourth-quarter economic growth.

In the United States, Chiquita Brands jumped 11 percent after announcing it had agreed to combine with an Irish fruit supply company.

Bond prices rose slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.78 percent.###262||Empty###263||Amazon is betting that shoppers will pay $20 more for its popular Prime two-day free shipping and video streaming service of movies and TV shows.

The mega online retailer said Thursday that it is raising the price of Prime to $99 a year as it seeks to offset rising costs to ship products to customers. It’s the first price increase since Amazon rolled out the service in 2005.

The move could please investors at a time when Amazon continues to face pressure to boost its bottom line after years of furious growth. As more Americans shop online, Amazon has spent heavily to expand its business into new areas – from movie streaming to e-readers and groceries – often at the expense of its profit.

But the price increase also threatens to scare away online shoppers who tend to resist fee increases. The company, which warned in January it would probably raise the price of Prime by $20 to $40, is bolstering the membership program by adding items available for two-day shipping and rolling out a greater selection of streaming TV shows and movies.

Still, online shoppers don’t always react favorably to price increases – for example, when Netflix tried to raise its annual subscription fee in 2011. The online video streaming service had to do an about-face after widespread customer backlash and a jarring stock plunge of 80 percent from its highs.

Social media was buzzing Thursday after Amazon announced the price increase. Prime users’ comments fell equally on either side of the fence between those who didn’t mind the increase and those who planned to stop using the program.

Nick Begley ordered from Amazon 53 times last year, everything from Curious George books for his toddler to a car phone charger. Begley, 33, says he shops at Amazon more since joining Prime in 2012 and is hooked on the convenience.

“It’s my go-to retail site,” says the resident of Salisbury Mills, N.Y. “$79 was a great price, but $99 is not enough for me to give it up.”

Rick Valente, who lives in Boston, felt the opposite way. After learning of the increase, he checked how much he actually uses Amazon: He realized Prime wasn’t worth it for him.

“It was never worth it to begin with, and it definitely isn’t worth it with the price increase,” says Valente, 25.

Amazon stressed in an email to members Thursday that it has not raised the price on Prime in nine years even though fuel and transportation costs have increased, it’s added new services, and the number of products available for two-day shipping has grown to 20 million from 1 million.

The company doesn’t disclose how many Prime members it has but said in December that it has “tens of millions” of members worldwide.

Analysts say that if Prime users are turned off by the increase, it could have a significant impact on Amazon’s business. Since it was introduced, Prime has increased customers’ appetite for speedy and reliable service, said Jordy Leiser, CEO of StellaService, which tracks customer service. Although Amazon doesn’t release data, analysts say Prime members are more loyal and spend more money on the site than non-Prime subscribers.

“The intersection of consistency and convenience for these customers has attracted so many people,” Leiser says.

Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge, who estimates there are about 23 million U.S. prime members, says he doesn’t expect the continued growth of Prime members to slow despite the price increase.

Investors, who along with analysts have been split on whether heavy investment at the expense of profit is the best strategy for Amazon, kept shares nearly flat on Thursday. After rising slightly in the morning, shares slipped 2 cents to $370.62 later in the day. The stock is down 7 percent since the beginning of the year.

“Some investors will continue to voice concern about Amazon’s seemingly endless appetite for investment,” said Citi Investment Research analyst Mark May in a client note. “We, on the other hand, continue to believe these investments make sense of driving long-term growth and greater absolute profits … over time.”###264||Empty###265||Empty###266||

NEW YORK -- Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which raises the question -- how often do people tip their baristas?

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company's app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don't earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn't be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there's no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

"It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city," Lemke said. At the drive-thru location where she works, for instance, she said tips go down when it's cold out and people are less likely to reach out and put money in the secured tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn't like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

"It's a way of claiming workers make more than you're paying them," she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

"We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best," Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview. There are no plans to bring the mobile tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn't share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

"They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees ... based on the number of hours worked," she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they'll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.###267||Empty###268||US stocks finished mixed as cautious investors kept an eye on the Ukraine crisis and awaited more information on the direction of the economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 11.17 points (0.1 per cent) at 16,340.08. The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.57 (0.03 per cent) at 1,868.20, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 16.14 (0.4 per cent) to 4,323.33.

''Investors are cautious... as global economic and geopolitical concerns cast a shadow on Wall Street,'' said a market note from Wells Fargo Advisors.

''Specifically, uncertainty over upcoming Chinese economic data and tensions between Russia and the Ukraine are weighing on stocks.''

''The two headlines stories driving the market are China and perhaps still some thought about what is going on in Ukraine,'' said David Levy of Kenjol Capital Management, echoing the concern about whether China is still slowing down.###269||THE Australian dollar is lower as more worries about tensions between Russia and Ukraine overshadow positive US economic data.

At 0700 AEDT on Monday, the local unit was trading at 90.36 US cents, down from 90.90 cents on Friday.

Russian state company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine’s new government by warning that if Ukraine doesn’t pay its debts, Russia could cut off wider supplies to Europe.

BK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said markets were initially positive about data showing that 175,000 jobs were added to the US economy in February but that changed after Russia made its threat.

“Equities traded sharply higher on the relief that non-farm payrolls did not miss expectations for the third month in a row,” she said.

“The sell-off was triggered by the one major uncertainty that has been hanging over the markets for the past few weeks and that is Ukraine.

“Considering that the Russian government owns a controlling interest in Gazprom, the world’s largest single gas producer, this threat is clearly representative of political posturing.” Ms Lien said the strong US employment data increases expectation that the US Federal Reserve will continue winding back its economic stimulus programs, which will further boost the US dollar and put downward pressure on the Australian dollar.

Panel of right wing came off on flight from Orlando, FL, to Atlanta, GA

Pilot forced to perform an emergency landing after missing panel spotted

Delta Airlines spokesman says it did not affect plane's ability to fly or land



A Delta Airlines plane had a lucky escape after part of its wing broke off during a flight from Florida to Georgia, it emerged today.

Passengers on board Flight 2412, from Orlando to Atlanta, were shocked when they looked out of the window to see a large panel missing from the wing, exposing a tangle of wires and hydraulic machinery to the elements.

Within minutes of a passenger spotting the damage, the pilot of the Boeing 757 decided to make an emergency landing.

The result was in line with expectations, said the Colorado Department of Revenue on a statement. The figures add to over $1.4 million (around 1 million euros) collected in taxes and fees from the sales of medical weed in the same month, for a total of around $3.5 million (around 2.5 million euros) of state income generated by marijuana sales.

According to the department, the data for recreational marijuana also include revenues from:

• a 2.9 percent state sales tax

• a special 10 percent tax on retail weed sales

• a 15 percent excise tax imposed on cultivators

• other licensing fees.

The statistics suggest the state-sanctioned marijuana business generated about $14 million in gross sales for the month. Over the course of this year, the first $40 million of tax revenue is designated for school construction and building under the Colorado legalisation law.

The figures also suggest that pot, the third most popular recreational drug in the US after alcohol and tobacco, is one of the most heavily-taxed consumer goods in Colorado.

Colorado became the first state in America’s history to legalise recreational marijuana and craft a regulatory framework to license, tax and enforce its use for recreation in January. Just as with alcohol, residents aged 21 or older can present their Colorado IDs and purchase up to one ounce of pot. Visitors from other states could purchase up to a quarter of an ounce.

An ounce of weed for recreational use reportedly costs about $200 (144 euros) in the state.

Private personal consumption, cultivation and possession of pot by adults for the sake of recreational use has been legal in Colorado for more than a year now, after voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2012.

Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalisation of recreational cannabis, has told lawmakers he would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programmes to prevent young people from using the drug.

Approved patients with official recommendations from licensed physicians have been able to purchase medical weed from specific dispensaries since 2002.

A dozen retail pot shops opened for business in Colorado on January 1 2014, marking a turning point in America’s drug culture.

After a similar vote Washington state will introduce legal sales of marijuana later this year.###277||If you haven't checked your email inbox this week (or opened a newspaper or turned on a television), you're probably going to be in for a shock: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is raising the price of Amazon Prime.

So it would appear Jeff Bezos wasn't bluffing. As you may recall, the Amazon CEO warned investors last month that, in order to keep up with the rising costs of "fuel and transportation," plus the continuous building out of Amazon's digital libraries for Kindle e-book sharing and video viewing, the company was probably going to have to raise the cost of Prime.

For nine long years, Amazon has held the price of its two-day free delivery service at a steady $79 per year, even as time, and inflation, marched merrily along. The popularity of Prime has helped grow Amazon's sales strongly, but its cost has been a big contributor to the fact that, with a net profit margin of less than 0.4%, Amazon is about nine times less profitable than Wal-Mart -- and makes even less profit per dollar of goods sold than does Bezos' supposedly beleaguered rivals at Best Buy.

Raising the annual cost of Prime by $20 to $99 might not change that. Or it might. It all depends on how customers react.

$99? It's a bargain!

The way I look at it, you can think of Amazon Prime in one of two ways:

As an all-you-can-eat two-day free delivery subscription, with Kindle lending and video streaming fringe benefits, or

As an alternative to Netflix for video streaming, with book borrowing and free shipping on the side.

Either way, Prime passes muster. According to a widget set up by our friends at Slate.com, your average Amazon shopper saves money on deliveries with Prime (at the new price) so long as he or she makes at least 25 orders from Amazon a year. This is assuming that the orders you place would cost only the minimum charge of $3.99 per delivery, though. In truth, one single delivery of a bulky, heavy item, needed quickly, can cost enough to justify a Prime subscription all on its own.

Meanwhile, viewed as a video streaming service, Prime's new price of $99 a year is almost identical to the yearly cost of a $7.99-per-month subscription to Netflix. It only takes one order for free delivery of an actual, physical product from Amazon to make Prime a better bargain than Netflix.

That's the view from a customer's perspective. From an investor's point of view, though, Amazon's in a stickier wicket.

$99? Never!

According to the company, "tens of millions" of customers now subscribe to Prime. Taking a conservative view of that boast, let's assume that there are 20 million paying Prime customers out there today, paying Amazon $1.58 billion for Prime service annually.

Were all 20 million to stick around and pay the $20 price hike on Prime, Amazon would receive a $400 million boost in revenue -- which would presumably drop straight to the bottom line, more than doubling the company's annual profit. This is almost certainly what investors, who have bid up Amazon shares by about 2% since the Prime price hike was announced, are hoping will happen.

But here's the thing: According to a recent survey of Amazon Prime customers that was commissioned by investment bank UBS, 42% of members will likely cancel their Prime memberships in response to the service's $20 price hike. Again, applying this percentage to a presumed 20 million Prime members, this means it's at least possible Amazon could see revenue decline as a result of the price hike, rather than rise.

Remove those 42% of Prime members from the revenue stream and, even with the price hike, Amazon could end up taking in as little as $1.15 billion in Prime revenue -- a 28% decline.

(In case you're curious, I've run similar calculations assuming that Amazon Prime actually has 30 million or even 40 million members; the conclusion is the same. In fact, the more Prime members Amazon has, the bigger the risk of lost revenue if those customers follow through on their threat and drop their Prime subscriptions).

Foolish takeaway

There are of course caveats to these calculations. For example, Amazon often boasts that Prime members spend more on its website than do non-Prime members. Accordingly, each Prime member lost could have an even bigger impact on Amazon's annual sales numbers than the calculations above suggest, focusing as they do solely on the effect on Prime revenue.

Conversely, if Prime members drop the service but keep on shopping -- and paying more for shipping -- Amazon's revenue loss could be much smaller than we fear.

All I can say for certain at this point is that the investors who have been bidding up Amazon shares steadily following the Prime price hike announcement may not be seeing the whole picture. Even if Prime is still a good deal for Amazon's customers, the risks for shareholders may be greater than they seem.###278||Tara Clarke: The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.

Subprime financial crisis-related events would ultimately become responsible for five out of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes, including the top two spots.

After the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 – a little under 18 months later.

U.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.

Since that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The S&P 500 Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the Nasdaq is up 235% (3,040.5).

In fact, as of this week, the bull market – defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more – ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group research.

However, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction – defined as a decline of 10% or more.

“I am very concerned about a correction right now,” Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. “The past few weeks have seen higher prices and lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air – every step higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather and turn around.”

Here are the three signs that have investors worried we’re due for a stock market crash or correction soon…

First, many investors are nervous about the duration of this bull market.

Most last from 50 to 67 months. The bull market that began in 1982 lasted about 60 months before the 1987 stock market crash. The bull market that began in 2002 lasted 60 months to a high in 2007.

And eerily, yesterday (Thursday), our current bull market hit its 60-month anniversary. The past two bull markets were immediately followed by crushing bear markets, and 2009’s fallout was the biggest since the Great Depression.

Second, investors are nervous about the lack of market correction.

A market correction hasn’t happened since October 2011 – that’s a 29-month stretch.

Historically, corrections occur every 18 months, according to S&P Capital IQ.

“The longer we go without resetting the dial, the greater the likelihood of a steeper correction, and the greater likelihood that it becomes a bear market,” S&P Capital IQ chief equity strategist Sam Stovall said to USA Today.

The third and final sign making investors wary of a stock market crash is U.S. Federal Reserve action. Since initiating its quantitative easing (QE) program in 2008, the Fed has managed to plump its balance sheet to somewhere over $4 trillion.

In December 2013, the Fed announced its intent to begin unwinding QE by tapering its monthly bond purchases. Since January, the Fed has cut its bond buying by $10 billion a month (to $75 billion).

That tapering is likely to negatively impact equity markets as fewer U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities are purchased each month.

Even though investors may give pause to the possibility of a stock market crash or correction, they should nonetheless stay invested – just with caution.

“You have to be in it to win it. I am urging people to raise stops and play very conservatively right now. But, do stay ready to buy,” Fitz-Gerald said. “Going forward, look to financials, tech, healthcare, and defense stocks.”

The central banker confirmed that it will not be walking away from an accommodative monetary policy because the labor market is still in a difficult predicament today.

Dudley noted that there have been several economic prospects that are “reasonably favorable,” but he did concede that he would like to see faster economic growth, a quicker decrease in the unemployment rate and higher inflation.

“I would very much prefer faster economic growth and more rapid progress towards our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability,” Dudley said last week in his oration presented at Brooklyn College in New York. “Hence, the continued need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative to support the economic recovery to the fullest.”

Since the quantitative easing measures were introduced by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the jobless rate threshold to start raising rates was 6.5 percent, which was reaffirmed by new Fed Chair Janet Yellen, though she did warn that they might not even be raised. Dudley concurred with this suggestion.

He made the case that rather than looking at a 6.5 percent unemployment figure, the Fed should analyze a wide variety of indicators which include the real estate market and financial state of those polled to make a complete health assessment of the overall labor market in the U.S. today.

“I do expect that growth will be strong enough to lead to continued improvement in labor-market conditions. I must caution, however, that the outlook for the unemployment rate is unusually uncertain,” said Dudley. “Such developments could result in a more muted rate of decline of the unemployment rate despite the faster growth.”

The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent.

The key Fed policy decision maker refrained from touching upon the central bank’s bond-buying measures. Instead, the Fed president said investor predictions that an increase in rates next year is sensible. However, analysts argue that his dovish tone in his speech and remarks might signify that the Fed is nowhere near tightening its near-zero interest rates that has been the policy for the past five years.

During an official swearing-in ceremony in Washington last week, Yellen reiterated her concerns again about the unstable labor market. We reported that Yellen promised that she would “do all that I can” to improve the availability of jobs and reassured the market she would continue the present interest-rate policy.

“I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy,” stated Yellen.

Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, told an audience at the Columbus State University on Monday that it’s likely the Fed will continue trimming its bond purchases at a $10 billion tapering pace.

“We’re at a point now where we’re moving away from purchasing assets, we’re tapering, and our balance sheet continues to be very large but we’re not going to add to it as much,” said Evans, Reuters reported. “The last two meetings we reduced the purchase flow rate by $10 billion and we’re going to continue to do that.”

Many haven’t been so quick to assume the Fed will persist in tapering. There have been ardent critics, such as Peter Schiff, Ron Paul and Marc Faber, that think Yellen and the Fed will actually enhance its monthly bond-buying initiatives. Late last year, Evans himself tweeted that the Fed would increase QE by 26 percent in 2014.###280||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###281||Amid mounting evidence that the disappearance of the Malaysian plane was a deliberate act, authorities today said the last words from the cockpit were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot as covering 11 countries were intensified.

Evidence indicating that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that went 10 days ago was sabotaged or hijacked was mounting after it emerged that the last message from the cockpit was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

The last words -- "All right, good night" -- were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a media briefing.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid are under scanner of the probe into the disappearance of the plane.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's final words.

The officials are also looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian - had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.

Malaysia's defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, "I can confirm that search and rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun. Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations."



A detailed map of the northern and southern corridors where the were on was released today.

Malaysia got in touch with countries along the northern and southern corridors about the flight. These countries include: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and France.

Australian was leading the search of the remote southern for the plane.

Kazakhstan joined the search today in the farthest northwest section of the search area, taking the total number of countries involved in the operation to 26.

During the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of China. Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search operation, Hishammuddin said.###282||Crews are planning to close the bridge for a week starting on Friday.

Sydney - Asian markets were finding their feet on Tuesday after a rocky ride the previous session, though uncertainty about the true state of China's economy kept nerves frayed and commodity prices restrained. Most regional shares edged ahead, with Japan's Nikkei adding 0.6 percent and the major European bourses were seen opening up around 0.2 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan put on 0.3 percent, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday.

Shanghai was flat so perilously close to its lowest since last July, while prices for industrial commodities stayed under water in the wake of February's shock fall in Chinese exports.

Dealers were especially nervous about iron ore following an 8 percent slide on Monday that fuelled unease about the health of China's giant steel sector.

Brent crude lost a further 16 cents to $107.92, while U.S. oil extended its decline to $101.06 a barrel.

There was some relief that rates in Chinese money markets were not showing much strain while the yuan was fixed in line with expectations.

Wall Street also managed to end steady on Monday after recouping early losses. The Dow Jones industrial average ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P 500 lost just 0.05 percent.

Other popular indicators of risk were benign. The stock market's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended little changed after an early spike, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent.

Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the U.S. dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies.

Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, stabilised at $0.9030 after losing half a U.S. cent on Monday.

The euro held rock steady at $1.3870, while the dollar inched up to 103.27 yen.

The Bank of Japan on Tuesday reaffirmed a commitment to massive monetary stimulus at its regular policy meeting, but downgraded its view on exports following soft data recently.

Nothing new was expected at this meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April.

The Japanese economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent annualised pace in the last quarter of 2013 as net exports proved a major drag, intensifying pressure for fresh action form the central bank.

Gold was a shade firmer at $1,341.70 an ounce on Tuesday as fears of an economic slowdown in China and Ukraine's geopolitical crisis keep investors seeking safe-haven bullion.

In a sign of investor confidence in the precious metal amid global uncertainties, the world's biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday.

Reuters###287||King Digital Entertainment Plc, the maker of hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month as the Irish company looks to take advantage of strong demand for technology investments.

The successful IPO of Twitter Inc in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's share price have fueled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including music-sharing service Spotify, lodging service AirBnB and payments company Square.

King should also get a boost in its US initial public offering from a surge in shares of digital coupon company Coupons.com Inc after it went public on Friday. Shares of Coupons.com doubled after being priced above the company's planned IPO range.

King Digital said it expected to price its IPO of 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 per share. At the top of this range, the company would be valued at about $7.6 billion.The offering is scheduled to be priced on March 25 and the stock will start trading on March 26, two underwriters told Reuters.

The Dublin-based company will sell 15.5 million shares in the offering, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.

King is hoping to benefit from a shift towards mobile platforms, social networks and app stores. The company derived 73% of gross bookings from mobile users in the fourth quarter ended December 31.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day, the filing showed.

The King IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million at the top-end of the planned range. It filed for a $500 million placeholder in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2% of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing. CEO Riccardo Zacconi, who has led the company since it was founded in 2003 in Sweden, will have a 9.5% stake.Candy Crush Saga, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and the year's top revenue-grossing app.It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra lives.

King offers 180 games in 14 languages through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website, but is heavily reliant on Candy Crush, which brings in about three-quarters of its revenues.The company said it has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING".

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.###288||SYDNEY: Shanghai copper dropped by its 5 percent daily limit on Monday to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country's first domestic bond default last week.

China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

This inflamed worries about appetite, as demand from Chinese consumers has yet to regain steam after the new year break. London copper prices slid to within a whisker of nearly three-year lows, after shedding nearly 4 percent on Friday.

“Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet,” said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing.

“We are still waiting to see demand resume, maybe after mid-March — there's still a chance it will happen.”

The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest since Sept. 2009.

Across the board, heavy selling in Shanghai metals contracts spilled into the new week, with ShFE aluminium hitting a 5-year low, ShFE lead a contract low and ShFE zinc sliding to its weakest in more than four months.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had dropped 1.1 percent to $6,709.25 a tonne by 0256 GMT.

It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.

But other LME contracts, many with stronger fundamentals than copper this year, held their ground, slipping to multi-week rather than multi-month or year lows.

Reflecting ample supply, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet.

China is the world's top user of copper, accounting for 45 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used for financing, where shipments are sold on domestic markets to raise funds for investment in higher yielding assets like real estate.

Worries these deals could unravel flustered traders on Friday after China recorded its first domestic bond default when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment, setting a landmark for market discipline in the world's second-largest economy.

The default is widely expected to force a re-pricing of credit risk that could pile pressure on weak borrowers.

Industries such as metals and mining, shipbuilding and materials are seen as key sectors with high default risks.

Li said that there was a substantial risk that sliding property market values or spreading debt market contagion could force copper financing deals to unravel.

“But I think it's not this year. The government is still expecting a stable slowdown, not a sharp slowdown – clearly real estate is heavily relevant to economic growth.”

Elsewhere, US job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.

Also curtailing risk appetite, were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine. Germany's Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution.###289||Empty###290||Cookies are used to offer you a better browsing experience and to analyze our traffic.

Gold prices ended the U.S. day session moderately higher Tuesday, on some more safe-haven demand that surfaced amid the simmering geopolitical situation in Ukraine. Gold futures on Tuesday settled near $1,350 an ounce, scoring a second-consecutive session gain as worries over Ukraine and concerns surrounding a slowdown in Chinese economic growth lifted the metal's safe-haven appeal for investors.

Gold for April delivery rose $5.20, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,346.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier touching a high of $1,353.

May silver shed 9.5 cents, or 0.5%, to $20.815 an ounce after a minor loss in the previous session.

The Ukraine matter is still a worry among traders and investors and has moved closer to the front burner of the market place. The Russian occupation of Crimea is a bullish factor for the safe-haven gold market.

U.S. economic data released Tuesday was on the light side and failed to move the markets. Wholesale inventories increased 0.6% in January after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.3%) in December. The consensus pegged inventory growth at 0.4%. Inventory growth in the durables sector slowed, increasing 0.4% in January after a 1.2% gain in December. Nondurable inventories rose 0.8% in January after falling 0.9% in December. Unfortunately, the strong gain in inventories was likely not planned. Sales, which edged up a slight 0.1% in December, crashed in January and fell 1.9%.

Traders are looking ahead to next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC).

* Loans pitted against auditors’ ‘challenger models’

* Collateral not valued for over a year must be revalued

By Laura Noonan

DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone’s largest banks when it details on Tuesday how it will test balance sheets, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.

The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets. Estimates of the capital shortfall range from 280 billion euros ($388.13 billion)to as much as 770 billion.

The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.

As well as the initial review on whether banks’ assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises.

A document detailing the tests’ methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches.

“It will terrify them, even though they’ve got a reasonable idea of what’s coming,” one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages.

The ECB declined to comment.

The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in Tuesday’s announcement would be the ECB’s view of when loans become impaired, and the way ‘hard to value assets’ are treated.

For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said.

A third source said that while the ECB’s decision on impairment triggers was “reasonable” some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB’s list of definitions of indicators for impairment.

Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen. “Triggers can be subjective,” the second source said.

If a loan’s status is changed from performing to non-performing, it would have a higher probability of default, some thing that would force a bank to set aside more capital to provide for higher likely losses.

Banks’ estimates on loan losses will be pitted against ‘challenger models’ created by external auditors - carrying out the tests on behalf of supervisors - an approach first tried in Ireland’s balance sheet assessment in late 2013, two of the sources said.

Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones.

The rules also require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said.

Beyond loans, the ECB’s treatment of ‘Level 3 assets’, a broad group of assets that are difficult to value, will also be closely watched. Those Level 3 assets include derivatives and also include assets such as real estate holdings banks have acquired through foreclosures, their participations in private equity deals and special investment vehicles.

The ECB has taken care to prevent any leaks. Recipients of details of the review face fines of 100,000 euros for leaks and copies have been water-marked with the name of its owner, the sources said.###294||With just two weeks until the “Obamacare” deadline for Americans to get health insurance or possibly face a tax penalty, enrollment specialist…###295||Empty###296||Over the years, Vladimir Putin has been building a Russian empire of energy pipelines throughout Europe. In aggregate, Russia provides about a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union, of which over half is carried through pipelines across Ukraine.

Building on this powerful energy network, Putin harbours a vision of a "Eurasian Union" to rival the EU. This vision seems to be part of his dream of restoring the lost glories of the former USSR.

It is possible that the vision goes beyond Eurasia, to include countries with historical, political or cultural ties, such as Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Vietnam.

Ukraine is a lynchpin for Russia's energy supplies to Europe, while Russia's Black Sea Fleet based in Crimea's Sevastopol is the core of Russia's Eurasian power projection. So the loss of Ukraine to the fold of the West would not only threaten Russia's national security but also unravel Putin's Eurasian dream.

For the West, Ukraine's about-turn presents a hard-won opening for bringing the country, whose western part is fiercely anti-Russia, into the EU fold - a further step to diminish Russia's stranglehold over Eastern Europe.

Russian armed forces are already deployed to Crimea. Will Putin use military force to reverse the status quo in Kiev or occupy pro-Russia eastern Ukraine? This seems unlikely.

The people in western Ukraine have clearly spoken. It's no use reclaiming a ticking anti-Russia political time bomb. Moreover, excessive military aggression will backfire on Russia's weak economy, vulnerable to energy demands in Europe. From a cost-benefit perspective, Russian energy supply would seem to be a more effective leverage over Ukraine.

The US is warning against Russian military intervention, threatening visa bans and asset freezes. But any response stops short of direct military confrontation, given that America's hands are tied with a war-weary electorate, budget constraints and rising pressures on the US pivot to Asia.

Taking advantage of America's military handicap, the EU's dependence on Russian energy, and the anti-Kiev sentiments of Crimea's Russian majority, Putin has moved with lightning speed. The parliament of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea has proposed holding a referendum on Sunday to determine the region's future. This is presumably to present a fait accompli before the West gets its act together.

The Russian president is likely to stick it out in Crimea, waiting for the predictable outcome of the referendum. If the outcome is for joining the Russian Federation, he would approve it, thereby annexing Crimea formally.

If the outcome is for Crimea to have much greater autonomy, he is likely to use it as a pretext for strengthening Russia's military presence there, ostensibly to protect Crimea's Russian majority from an anti-Russia Kiev leadership. Either way, Putin is likely to be able to achieve his aim of securing a permanent home for Russia's crucial Black Sea Fleet.

Henry Kissinger, writing recently in The Washington Post, has proposed a "Finland model" to solve the Ukrainian crisis, comparing the Scandinavian country's fierce independence while maintaining cordiality with Russia.

This consists of: first, letting the Ukrainian people choose their collective future; second, not letting Ukraine into Nato, to avoid provoking Russia; third, leaving Ukraine free to create any government compatible with the will of its people; and fourth, in exchange for Russia's recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty, Crimea's autonomy would be reinforced in elections.

Kissinger's formula would help de-escalate the rising tensions. Whether it could ensure that Crimea remains intact under Ukrainian sovereignty remains to be seen. What is clear is that the recent events for Ukraine's future are but moves on a grand chessboard between the West and a resurgent Russia under Putin.

The LME's flagship three-month copper contract was down 3.8 per cent at $US6,781 a metric ton at the PM kerb close on Friday, its lowest price since July 31.

Chinese solar-equipment maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co became the first Chinese company to default on a bond traded in the mainland on Friday, rattling investor confidence. The default comes amid broader fears about the impact of slowing Chinese economic growth on demand for base metals, which are used in everything from smartphones to household plumbing. China is the world's top metals consumer, accounting for about 40 per cent of global copper demand.

"Metals were rocked by the Chinese corporate default," said Michael Turek, director of metals trading with futures brokerage Newedge.

"This underscores not only the systemic structural debt issue there but also the Chinese central government's apparent willingness to forgo short-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth to skim speculative excesses for longer-term benefit."

While copper's deep descent could attract some opportunistic buying at lower levels "it will take some really positive Chinese news to lift copper back from the doldrums," said Chris Beauchamp a market analyst at IG.

In its latest interim economic assessment, the Paris-based OECD said that Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will show growth of 0.7% between January and March of this year.



The organization warned, however, that the expansion won't be easy or direct as in the second quarter of this year, economic growth will stall, likely showing just 0.1% expansion between April and June.



Mixed results are nothing new in the lackluster Italian economy which has struggled to recover from its worst recession since the Second World War.



Still, it received a bit of good news Tuesday as official data from the national statistical agency Istat confirmed that Italy's economy grew slightly - about 0.1% - in the final quarter of last year compared with the previous quarter, proving a harsh two-year recession is over.



Istat also revised upwards its official estimate for GDP for 2013, reporting that it fell by 1.8% rather than the 1.9% it had previously estimated.



Both figures suggest that the country is on a painfully slow path to recovery. The agency also revised its annualized comparison figures but not for the better, saying that GDP fell by 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 with respect to the same period in 2012 - a slightly worse figure than a preliminary estimate of a 0.8% loss.



Such figures demonstrate that it's time European nations turn their focus from concerns about cutting costs and reducing debt to instead consider policies aimed at encouraging growth and recovery, Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told his counterparts from across the continent during meetings Tuesday. "(We) must ensure that Europe looks more to growth and consolidation after the great crisis that hit us," said Padoan during his first major outing as Italy's economy minister. The Italian government was quick to reassure its European partners that Italy will not remain the weakest link but instead, expects to see "significant" results from its economic reforms designed to boost growth and jobs "within 2-3 years," Padoan told eurozone finance ministers earlier.



In fact, ANSA sources say that Italy's government has found ways to finance 10 billion euros in tax cuts quickly, which it hopes will stimulate growth.



"We're there," the sources said Tuesday, adding that the cuts will be concentrated on income taxes, with a few "selective" incentives for companies that take on new staff. Around half of the new money will come from a review of public spending, the sources said, with another three billion euros coming from savings derived from a drop in the costs of servicing the national debt.



Another slice of the money should come from a reduction in military spending. Buttressing what Premier Matteo Renzi says will be a new direction, on Wednesday he is expected to introduce what he has described as an extensive program of job creation measures.



In terms of Italy's GDP, "my attitude is one of caution. I prefer to estimate on the low side (of growth)," Padoan said after a Monday meeting of his eurozone counterparts.



That suggests Padoan, who was until recently chief economist of the OECD, supports recent forecasts made by the European Commission, which projected that Italy would see average GDP growth this year of just 0.6%.



Padoan also reassured the other finance ministers that Italy's plan won't put at risk its compliance with European budget rules.



"The priority is to put in place policies to promote growth and employment, without wasting earlier efforts made to keep Italy's deficit-to-GDP ratio within the European Union-mandated limit of 3%," he said.



Padoan urged his counterparts to give Italy some breathing room to reform its economy, but said that should not take too long as many policies were already prepared and introduced by Renzi's predecessor, Enrico Letta.



"Many of the directions of the government are in line with those of the previous government," but the difference now is that Renzi "intends to accelerate," said Padoan.



Italy has been under considerable pressure from the European Commission, which has complained that Italy's 2014 budget, passed by Letta, was insufficient to correct the country's "excessive macroeconomic imbalances", including high debt and low competitiveness.



The EC has warned that it would be monitoring Italy's macroeconomic imbalances and efforts by the eurozone's third-largest economy to reform these. (ANSAmed).###302||Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.

In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China's exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.

In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.

The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.

"It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table," said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it's) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It's going to be par for the course for this year."

The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.

The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.

The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.

"The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China," said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. "Expectations have been coming down, but the numbers have been disappointing even those reduced expectations."

Despite the disappointing data from China, some market watchers anticipate that last week's gains will continue.

The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of unusually severe winter weather, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also helped encourage investors.

"In general, I think the market will move past the poor China export numbers fairly quickly," said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. "There's still a lot of fundamental support for the S&P at this particular range."

Chalupnik also anticipates Monday's decline isn't telling of the market's trajectory for the week ahead, barring more fallout from Russia's deployment of troops in Ukraine.

"My guess is the market moves ever so slightly higher this week," he said. "The trend is still up. We really haven't seen anything to break that trend."

Monday marked the fifth anniversary of the current bull market in stocks. The S&P 500 index bottomed out on March 9, 2009, and is up about 177 percent since then. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.

This is a light week for market-moving economic data and corporate earnings. But investors will be watching the latest data on retail sales, due out Thursday, and a gauge of consumer confidence due out Friday.

"Those two sets of numbers will really tell us where the consumer is and whether or not the consumer will head out and spend when the weather warms up," Liu said.

Among the stocks bucking the slight downward turn Monday was Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

The company climbed the most of any stock in the S&P 500 index, vaulting $11.95, or 7.1 percent, to $180. The company raised its 2014 earnings forecast, saying the national health agency of France will reimburse it for past sales of its drug Soliris.

Chiquita was another gainer. It agreed to combine with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company. The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion in annual revenue. Chiquita rose $1.16, or 10.7 percent, to $12.

Southwest Airlines' stock touched a 52-week high of $23.67 early in the day before ending up 50 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.60. The carrier got a boost after it reported that passengers are flying more miles, a trend that helped send a key revenue figure higher last month.###303||Warning - there was an unexpected script error.

Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean has today addressed the North-East Chamber of Commerce, expressing the view that any additional strength for the pound would hamper a solid export-based recovery in Britain.

The comments sent the GBP/USD down to 1.66208 – its lowest level this month. As well, and for the first time since mid-February, the pair slipped below its 20-day Simple Moving Average, currently near 1.6661.

In a rare observation on the pound’s rate of exchange by a member of the BoE’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, Bean told the assembled business-people: "Any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10 percent in trade-weighted terms since March [2013], would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports." said Bean

Last month fellow-MPC member Ian McCafferty noted that if sterling were to continue its rise against the currencies of some the UK's key trading partners he "would get more worried”. On 14 February, the GBP/USD hit a three-year high of 1.38217 but since then the currency pair has largely been treading water.

More generally, sterling has been strengthening against the greenback on account of market conviction that the UK central bank will start hiking rates before the US Federal Reserve.

“It is still early days and the MPC will be doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud,” said Bean today. “But when the time does come for us to start raising Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.”

He reiterated that the BoE wants to see a “revival” in business investment, productivity growth and a deficit-shrinking boost in exports before proclaiming that the UK recovery is sustainable. For that reason, Bean shared, the MPC “is keeping a beady eye on the housing market”.

Right now, the GBP/USD is trading at around 1.6639, down 0.5 percent intraday.###306||Malaysia on Thursday denied a media report that its missing airliner flew on for hours after last making contact, and said Chinese photos that raised hopes of a search breakthrough actually showed no wreckage.

“Those reports are inaccurate,” Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said of a Wall Street Journal report that said US investigators suspected the plane had flown on.

The report said data automatically sent to the ground from the aircraft’s Rolls-Royce engines suggested the Boeing 777 was in the air for four hours after its last contact with air traffic control at 1.30am Malaysian time.

“The last transmission from the aircraft was at 0107 hours which indicated that everything was normal,” Hishammuddin said.

The Malaysia Airlines (MAS) jet was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on an overnight flight when it disappeared.

“Rolls-Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS and investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised.”

He also said China had told Malaysia that satellite photos released on the website of a Chinese state oceanic agency, apparently showing three large objects in a suspected crash site, were released “by mistake and did not show any debris.”

A huge search effort has failed to find any evidence of the plane’s fate despite scouring land and sea for six days.

It has been repeatedly dogged by false leads and conflicting information, drawing mounting accusations that Malaysia is bungling the response.

The effort involves dozens of vessels and aircraft from countries around Asia, plus the United States.

The Chinese agency’s images had prompted Malaysia and Vietnam to dispatch planes to the area in question in the South China Sea to hunt for the suspect objects.

“The publication of the images on the website is an accident,” Hishammuddin said, relating a statement he said he had received from China’s ambassador to Malaysia.

He said the Chinese government did not endorse the action and was investigating.###307||Empty###308||PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - French cable company Numericable reiterated on Wednesday its three-year targets to grow sales 2-5 percent annually and invest in upgrading its network, as it posted a small drop in full-year core profit.

Guilt is a terrible thing to live with, so Starbucks will release an updated iPhone app next week, enabling customers to use their smartphone to leave a tip.

The tipping function is part of Starbuck's upgraded iOS app that rolls out on March 19. The app already allows customers to access their rewards program and to pay for their order at the chain's 7,000 locations. Those wishing to give a little extra will be given the option of leaving a $.50, $1 or $2 tip. Adding digital tipping was one of the most often received suggestions the coffee house chain has received.

"As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have also asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to store partners," said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S., Americas and Teavana.

Those using Android phones will either have to keep a few extra bucks in their pockets or live with the guilt of not being able to tip, as the company does not plan to roll out this update for its Android app until later this year. Both apps are only for customers in the U.S., UK and Canada.

Digital payment is catching on at Starbucks. The company reported that each week about 11 percent of Starbuck's customers use their smartphone to pay for an order. Overall, about 10 million people are using the mobile app.

"This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we'll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come," said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks.

The app received other improvements to make digital payments easier. The customer can now just shake their phone to quickly bring up the rewards card barcode and pay for their order. The user interface was also streamlined and made more accessible.

The card's other features remain unchanged. They can still pay, check their rewards history, look for promotions, reload their Starbuck's Card, find stores and send virtual gift cards to friends.

About $2 million of that came from recreational pot.

The state earned about $2.9 million in total tax revenue and $592,000 in fees.

“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” said Barbara Brohl, executive director of the Department of Revenue, in a statement. “We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.”

Denver County had the highest combined state sales tax revenue with $984,000 and $442,000 in medical marijuana sales tax. Summit County was second in retail sales tax and El Paso County was second in medical marijuana sales tax.

Marijuana became legal to buy in Colorado in January for anyone over 21. Marijuana for medical use has been legal since 2000.

What happens to much of that money remains an open question. Aside from $40 million or so set aside for school construction, lawmakers will have discretion on how the money is spent.###314||The Federal Reserve wants to wait until late 2015 to raise interest rates, but a falling unemployment rate and rising wages could force its hand even earlier.

Since 1985 the Fed has usually started to raise rates once wage growth topped 2.5%, according to research by Capital Economics. And annual wage growth has typically accelerated to 2.5% or higher when the unemployment rate fell below 7%.

As of February, the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 6.7%, and it’s been on a downward arc for the past year. Meanwhile the annual growth in wages of nonsupervisory workers — those not in management — rose to a three-year high of 2.5% last month from 2.3% in January.

In most scenarios, the Fed already would have raised the fed funds rate — now effectively at zero — to head off any threat of inflation or the economy overheating. So does that mean the central bank will raise rates a lot sooner than the end of 2015?

Maybe, but it’s by no means certain. The increase in wages over the past few months could just be a temporary spike, for one thing. And the U.S. economy still isn’t close to running on all cylinders, a situation that suggest the bank could wait a lot longer than it normally does to see how much wages will increase.

“The Fed’s current plan to leave interest rates on hold until late 2015 despite expecting the unemployment rate to fall further and inflation to gradually rise back to 2% shows that it is being much more cautious about raising interest rates,” noted Paul Dales, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

Still, Dales thinks the Fed will have to act a “bit faster than most people expect.” If so, the bank might drop some clues on Wednesday after its latest policy-setting meeting and the first news conference by new Chairwoman Janet Yellen. Read preview of Fed meeting: It’s pledge week at the Fed.

The new entity will run under two individual names, and not include Eddie Bauer, which Jos. Bank originally wanted to obtain, but had to forgo to follow the transaction's terms.

The acquisition still needs to complete the regulation process associated with the deal, which is expected as the third fiscal quarter concludes pending the outcome.

Bank's revenue decreased three consecutive quarters.###320||China's central bank pulled the trigger on something the market already knew it was aiming at -- widening the trading band for the nation's currency. The People's Bank of China said it would allow the yuan to move 2% above or below a rate it sets every day for the currency against the U.S. dollar, up from 1% now, in a move that will mean the yuan will behave a little more like major currencies.

The policy move, which takes effect Monday, still lets the PBOC keep its thumb on the foreign exchange scale, knowing the currency won't move more than 2% away from where it wants it on any given day.

The central bank was widely seen as preparing the market for just such a move when it let the currency slip repeatedly last month. Still, the central bank managed to surprise more than a few people with the timing of its announcement -- just before dinner hour on Saturday night. One analyst referred to this as "PBOC style" with the central bank showing that it still could shake things up just a little when it wanted.

The PBOC, which last expanded the band to 1% from 0.5% in April of 2012, said that this was part of its effort to make the exchange rate more market-based, and that it would continue to push ahead with this effort. It also said this did not mean either a big depreciation -- or appreciation for the currency -- in the future and it added that Chinese companies were already better prepared to deal with somewhat greater yuan fluctuations.

It also said it would withdraw from routine intervention in the foreign exchange market.

Analysts generally applauded the move -- which had been already been touched on in Premier Li Keqiang's work report delivered at the opening of the annual session of parliament this month.

Following are some of comments from analysts (edited for style and length):

-----

"This was a good time to widen the trading band. It came at a time when there was a rather large division in the views on the direction of the yuan and came against a background of slowing capital inflows," wrote Bank of Communications economists in a note to clients. "This can effectively avoid a big appreciation or depreciation of the yuan's exchange rate immediately following the move."

They added that central bank will probably push ahead with the introduction of new foreign exchange-related products, relax some restrictions on fund movements under the capital account and it might raise its ceiling on domestic bank deposit interest rates this year.

(Editor's explanatory note: Domestic bank deposit rates are currently capped at 1.1 times a benchmark rate set by the central bank. Liberalized interest rates and relaxed capital account restrictions are seen as key parts of a package of inter-related financial reforms).

---

"Today's band widening strengthens the PBOC's signal that the one-way bet on the yuan is over and we should expect more yuan/dollar volatility going forward," Lu Ting, economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients.

"We believe the PBOC won' stop here, but further band widening is of little meaning. A much more important and meaningful reform is to change the rule on setting the daily fixing of yuan/dollar. As an intermediate step, the PBOC could peg the yuan to a basket of currencies weighted by the importance of (China's) trading partners."

------

"If the PBOC really withdraws from intervening in the market in the near term there would be more volatility," said Ma Xiaoping, economist at HSBC. "They will probably withdraw gradually."

"The PBOC has been signaling that it was moving in this direction. In the future there will be a more flexible exchange rate based on market supply and demand."

-----

"The central bank is trying to spur businesses and financial institutions to prepared for a more flexible exchange rate," said Louis Kuijs of RBS.

"They want to let this volatility happen so people will up their game. They want volatility but it's going to be a bit contrived, generated by policy not by the market," he said.

"It might not lead to big changes on a day-to-day level, but it signals they are serious about moving toward more flexibility."

---

"The move was as we anticipated though the margin of the band widening was less than we had expected," said Lu Zhengwei of Industrial Bank in a comment on his Sina Weibo account. "We had expected 2.5%-3.0% and this shows that the authorities are being cautious."

The economist also said: "This also shows the yuan's recent depreciation is over and we will now see two-way movement in the exchange rate."

Toyota Kirloskar Motor today declared lockout at its two manufacturing plants at Bidadi near Bangalore, following the failure of talks between the management and the union over wage negotiations.

The production at the two plants having an installed capacity of 3,10,000 units, has been disrupted since the past 25 days.

"The management and the union have been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY14 for the past 10 months.

As a bipartite agreement was not reached, the Karnataka Labour Department has conducted seven tripartite meetings to reach a settlement. But the conciliation efforts have not yet resulted in an agreement, leading to the lockout," the Japanese auto major said in a statement.

The statement also said even as the talks were on, a section of the workers, instigated by the union, has resorted to deliberate stoppage of the production line, and threatened supervisors and continuously disrupted business for the past 25 days.

"In this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," the statement concluded.

The workers' union, however, could not be contacted.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor is a 89:11 joint venture between the world's largest auto company Toyota and the Pune-based Kirloskar Group, respectively.

Set up in October 1997, the two plants at Bidadi employs over 6,400 people and has an installed capacity of 3,10,000 units per annum. The plant rolled out the first car in December 1999.

While the first facility has an installed capacity of 1,00,000 units, the second plant has an installed capacity of 2,10,000 units.

The two plants are set up on a sprawling 432 acre land parcel in the Bangalore suburb.

The company manufactures the MPV segment leader Innova, the SUV Fortuner, from the first plant since October 1999, while it has also been rolling out the sedans Corolla Altis, the Etios, the hatchback Etios Liva and the luxe sedans Camry, and the Camry Hybrid from the second plant since December 2010.

The company also sells the premium SUV brands Prado, the Land Cruiser and the hybrid sedan Prius as completely built units.###323||Empty###324||Empty###325||You are using an older browser version.

The net loss widened from 553 million euros a year earlier and exceeded the 10.6 billion-euro loss the bank reported in the third quarter of 2011. UniCredit took a charge of more than 9 billion euros on intangible assets, including goodwill writedowns at its Austrian unit, the Milan-based bank said in a statement today.

Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni plans to eliminate 8,500 jobs and sell assets to strengthen UniCredit's finances as part of a five-year plan announced today. The lender is targeting 2 billion euros of net income in 2014 as Italy begins to emerge from a recession and stricter capital requirements imposed by regulators restrain earnings. The bank set aside 9.3 billion euros for bad loans in the fourth quarter, double the amount of a year before.

"Thanks to the additional provisions booked, UniCredit now has by far the highest impaired loan coverage ratio of the Italian banking system and amongst the best in Europe, in line with pre-crisis levels," Ghizzoni, 58, said in the statement.

UniCredit rose as much as 2.2 percent, after initially declining following the release. The stock was up 2.1 percent at 6.17 euros by 3:05 p.m. in Milan trading.

The bank proposed a stock dividend of 10 cents a share for 2013, though shareholders will have the option of requesting cash. UniCredit paid a nine cent-a-share cash dividend on 2012 earnings.

UniCredit raised its bad-loan coverage ratio to 52 percent on Dec. 31 as the European Central Bank began examining the balance sheets of the euro area's largest banks.###328||Watch the video above: Fixed or variable mortgage? It depends on who you ask. Laura Zilke reports.

TORONTO – Longer-term fixed mortgage rates may soon be a better deal than variable rates for homebuyers, according to a new report by BMO Capital Markets.

BMO (TSX:BMO) chief economist Douglas Porter and senior economist Benjamin Reitzes say that historically, choosing a variable mortgage rate has been more “cost-effective” than locking in on a five-year fixed rate, but this may no longer be the case as signs of an improving economy continue.

It’s been long anticipated that both the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to hike interest rates in 2015.

“True, it may have seemed that markets and economists have played the role of The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf on higher interest rates in recent years,” says the report released Thursday, titled “Mortgage Choices: The Fix(ed) is In.”

“But there are emerging signs that the tide is finally turning for rates, especially with the U.S. economy poised to accelerate. The bond market has sent out loud warning signals over the past year that the era of low interest rates may finally be drawing to a close.”

Currently, a five-year fixed mortgage rate from one of the big Canadian banks hovers above three per cent, with variable rates ranging below that.

Porter and Reitzes say that as bond yields rise they will put pressure on borrowing costs and long-term mortgages.

“So, even if variable rates take some time to climb, we may not see such low fixed rates again any time soon,” says the report.

They also said any potential hikes will affect most those who are already stretched too thinly in the housing market, so locking in at a higher rate may be beneficial for this group to weather any drastic increases.

“For those who don’t have much financial flexibility and would run into difficulty from a pronounced upswing in interest rates (typically first-time homebuyers), any potential extra cost for peace of mind now appears to be a price well worth paying,” according to the report.

Earlier this week, the Teranet-National Bank national composite price index found that home prices are steadily rising.

In February, Canada home prices rose 0.3 per cent.

The index, which tracks the average home price in 11 metropolitan markets, found that home prices were up in all five markets surveyed in Western Canada and were down in all five metropolitan eastern markets except Montreal.###329||Empty###330||Empty###331||(Reuters) – Mt. Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange that late last month filed for bankruptcy protection, updated its website on Tuesday to allow customers to log in and verify their wallet, or account, balance.

The website, which went blank just over three weeks ago, had previously posted occasional updates on Mt. Gox’s civil rehabilitation process – a legal procedure that may allow Mt. Gox to rebuild and pay back some of its creditors – as well as a warning that some spam or phishing emails purporting to be from the exchange were in circulation.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28, saying it may have lost 850,000 bitcoins – worth around $520 million at current prices – to hackers.

A spokesperson reached via a helpline for Mt. Gox creditors confirmed that Mt. Gox set up the log-in, based on the last available data from the exchange’s servers before they shut down.

Leaked information from various hacking attacks on Mt. Gox servers and CEO Mark Karpeles’ personal blog and Reddit account have been released in recent weeks, and one file purporting to be the company’s internal database contained malware that could steal bitcoins once downloaded.

Besides the log-in option, the Mt. Gox homepage carried a statement in English and Japanese saying: “Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by Mt. Gox of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users.”

There are varying estimates about how much premiums have gone up over the last several years, but everyone tends to agree that the increased costs are a concern. In fact, President Barack Obama has cited premium increases as part of the larger case for healthcare reform, promising that Obamacare would reduce premiums by $2,500 per year.

But, to Sebelius’ point, let’s take a look a premium increases, not just since 2010, but going back to 2005 through data provided by eHealthInsurance.com. As you can see in the chart below, the average individual health insurance premium rose by 37% from 2005 to 2013 and by 31% for the average family premium. Keep in mind that these are pre-Obamacare premiums.

Here’s the kicker, folks. eHealth, the nation’s first and largest private exchange, has also released data comparing average February 2013 premiums to unsubsidized plans that were being purchased in February 2014.

According to data released last month, the average increase for an individual health plan purchased through the eHealth was 39% compared to 2013, pre-Obamacare coverage and 56% for a family plan.

The average increase for health plans between 2013 and 2014 surpassed the average increase of the previous eight years combined.

Why did premiums rise so much? Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna, explained the reasons in an October appearance on CNBC, pointing to actuarial benefit requirements in the law, taxes and fees that have been passed on to consumers, and the mandated benefits.

“[A]ll those things add up to an average increase we’ve seen across the United States,” noted Berotlini, “depending on the market, of anywhere from 30% to 40%, ranging anywhere from low single digits, all the way over 100% increases.”

Sebelius can’t really predict that the premiums will “go up at a smaller pace than what we’ve seen since 2010.” Why? Well, the Department of Health and Human Services can’t tell Congress how many of the 4.2 million people who’ve “selected plans” on the exchanges have actually made a premium payment. Insurers, however, have reported that roughly 20% haven’t made a payment.

Additionally, it remains to be seen how many young people the administration will sign up for health coverage. Through February, just 25% of those who’d selected plans were between the ages of 18 and 34, far below the 38% to 40% the administration said it needed for the risk pools to be sustainable.

Now, it may be that the bailout provisions, which the administration expects to cost $5.5 billion in the next fiscal year, limit the impact of the increases. But if the administration didn’t expect that premiums would rise by a significant amount, it wouldn’t have delayed the 2015 open enrollment period until after this year’s mid-term election. After all, sticker shock could be electoral poison for Democrats.###337||Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has warned amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine.

"Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt," Tusk told reporters on Monday, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to its east.

Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.

"The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union," Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the NATO defence alliance.

The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Merkel's Wednesday visit.

"I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole," he said.

"I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money," Tusk said.

"This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon," he added.

Tusk said talks with Merkel would also focus on "how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance".

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday the issue of Europe's reliance on Russian energy should be discussed, after talks with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski in London.

"Long term ... the European Union needs to talk about how we recast our approach including on energy policy, to change the balance of leverage between Russia and the EU," Hague said.

Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev.###338||Empty###339||Empty###340||Premier Li Keqiang vowed to build a sound social security net for the public, including an integrated pension arrangement for rural and urban residents.

More than 800 million of China's populace are covered by different pension programs, Li said.

The government will gradually enhance the pension level and merge scattered pension arrangements to promote equal access to social welfare, he said.

The government will also work harder to provide assistance and help for underprivileged social groups, including those who experience difficulty after being hit by natural disasters or disease, he added.###341||China’s Premier Li Keqiang gestures as he speaks during a news conference, after the closing ceremony of the Chinese National People’s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, March 13, 2014. ― Reuters pic

BEIJING, March 13 ― Chinese Premier Li Keqiang warned today that the economy faces “severe challenges” in 2014 - comments that came as weak data fanned speculation the central bank would relax monetary policy to support stuttering growth.

Li, speaking at a news conference on the final day of China’s yearly parliament, hinted Beijing would tolerate slower economic expansion this year while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing longer-term and more sustainable growth.

Data released shortly after his comments suggested that tolerance may face an early test. Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

“A storm is coming,” said Gao Yuan, an analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai, while Hao Zhou, the China economist for ANZ said “policy easing should be imminent.”

At the carefully orchestrated briefing where questions had to be vetted in advance, Li spent most time discussing the economy. But he also touched upon other topics, including friction in relations with Washington, corruption, pollution, and the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines aircraft.

While acknowledging the economy faced difficulties, Li suggested Beijing would not let growth slip too far. The government has targeted a rise of GDP in 2014 of 7.5 per cent after actual growth last year of 7.7 percent.

“We believe we have the ability, and all the means, to ensure that economic growth will stay within a reasonable range this year,” he said.

He also signalled the government will allow further debt defaults after Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Co Ltd failed last Friday to pay an interest payment on its five-year bonds.

The first default on a domestic bond was hailed by experts as a landmark that will impose more market discipline, a break from the past when bonds enjoyed an implicit guarantee because the government would bailout troubled firms to ensure stability.

Growth in Chinese corporate debt has been unprecedented. A Thomson Reuters analysis of 945 listed medium and large non-financial firms showed total debt soared by more than 260 per cent to US$777.3 billion (RM2, 544 billion) between December 2008 and September 2013.

“We are reluctant to see defaults of financial products, but some cases are hard to avoid,” Li said. “We must enhance oversight and solve problems in a timely way to ensure no systemic and regional risks.”

Li said financial and fiscal reforms are among top priorities this year, reinforcing market expectations that long-awaited changes to liberalise bank deposit rates and efforts rein in local government debt could be in the pipeline.

Chinese leaders unveiled plans last year for sweeping reforms aimed at transforming the economy’s reliance on investment and exports, which have fuelled double-digit growth for three decades, to one that leans more on services and consumption. It included allowing market forces to play a bigger part in the economy.

Priority on jobs

The signs of a slowdown in the economy this year have raised worries among some investors that China will miss the 7.5 per cent growth target.

“The momentum is really quite weak,” Wei Yao, China economist for Societe Generale said after Thursday's data. “Q1 GDP growth is probably already below 7.5 per cent. The government will probably do some easing.”

Yao said she expected the central bank to reduce bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points. Major banks currently have to put aside a fifth of their cash as reserves and such a measure would represent the central bank’s strongest policy easing since 2012.

Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters earlier this week that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if economic growth slowed further. But they said policy action may only happen in the second quarter.

Li skilfully dodged a question on how far Beijing would let economic growth slip before it steps in with policy measures to support activity. Still, he hinted at tolerance for below-target growth, as long as enough new jobs are created.

“The GDP growth target is around 7.5 per cent. ‘Around’ means there is some flexibility and we have some tolerance,” he said, adding that the lower limit on growth must ensure job creation.

Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said last week that China can slightly miss the 7.5 per cent growth target as long as enough jobs are created.

However, Xu Shaoshi, the head of the pro-growth National Development and Reform Commission, said on Wednesday that the 7.5 per cent target would be the lower limit for the government.

Beijing wants to create 10 million new jobs in 2014 and Li has said that the economy must grow 7.2 per cent annually to do that. Some 13 million new jobs were created last year when the economy grew 7.7 percent.

Premier Li said the government will take a differentiated approach to cool the property market, rather than using one-size-fits-all policies used by his predecessors that have largely failed to calm real estate inflation.

“We need to apply differentiated property measures in different cities based on different types of demand and local conditions,” Li said.

But on government corruption, Li had an unequivocal answer.

“We will show zero tolerance for corrupt behaviour and corrupt officials. No matter who it is, or how senior their position, everyone is equal before the law,” Li said, without mentioning any names.

Speculation has gathered around China’s former domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang, who sources say is at the centre of a corruption investigation reaching into the highest echelons of government, though Beijing has yet to formally confirm this. ― Reuters###342||Sbarro said Monday that it is filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, the struggling pizza chain's second trip through bankruptcy court in less than three years.

The filing comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures. The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.

It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to "allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy" as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.###343||Empty###344||Empty###345||King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.



"Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.



Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.



"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.



Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.



However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.



"I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.



"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."



Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.



Another Zynga?



"Candy Crush" launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.



The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".



Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.



But most of that growth was fueled by "Candy Crush" rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.



King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.



Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of "Farmville" waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of "Angry Birds".



Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.



To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in "Candy Crush" gross bookings.



However, bookings rose for its other games such as "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga". About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.



King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.



"The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."



NYSE debut



King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.



Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.



Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.



In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.



At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.



Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.



JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.###346||Empty###347||Empty###348||The Chinese currency Renminbi, or the yuan, went up 25 basis points to 6.1321 against the U.S. dollar on Monday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.

In China's foreign exchange spot market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.

The central parity rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar is based on a weighted average of prices before the opening of the market each business day.

China widened the yuan's daily trading band from the current 1 percent to 2 percent on Monday.

The move is aimed at enhancing the floating flexibility of the Renminbi exchange rate, making capital allocation more efficient, facilitating economic restructuring and beefing up the decisive role of the market in allocating resources, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said in a Saturday statement.

China has gradually raised its currency's daily trading limit, from 0.3 percent in 1994 to 0.5 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2012.###349||The content you're looking for is no longer available.###350||Empty###351||Mumbai: Mercedes-Benz India Pvt. Ltd, India’s second largest luxury car maker, will assemble its premium S Class model locally, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The move, it said, will help the firm address increasing demand for the model. It has a waiting period of some three months.

Priced at Rs.1.36 crore, the S Class 500 will be the fifth Mercedes-Benz model to be assembled at the company’s facility in Chakan, Pune. The other models assembled here are the E-Class, C-Class, GL-Class and the M-Class. The A-Class, CLS-Class, SLK-Class and the luxury tourer B-Class are imported.

The company is also initiating a chauffeur training programme for the S Class customers. The 21 modules in the programme focus on enhancing chauffeurs’ soft skills, etiquette, personal development, courtesy and safety.

Encouraged by the small but fast-expanding tribe of luxury car owners, makers of global luxury cars have identified India as an important market. In 2013, about 30,000 luxury cars were sold in India, an expansion of 25% over the previous year. This was in a year when the mass car market saw its first annual decline in 11 years.###352||Ready to fight back? Sign up for Take Action Now and get three actions in your inbox every week.

Plain, old-fashioned capitalism will prevent a new cold war between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and Russia’s gobbling up of the Crimean region. Capitalism, plus the fact that probably not one American in a thousand could locate Crimea on a map, and even the most hard-headed US political analysts have trouble coming up with a decent definition of what US interests in Ukraine might be. Ad Policy

Helping to contain the crisis is the fact that Russia, Europe and to a lesser extent the United States are tied together in a powerful web of financial and economic ties that didn’t exist, say, during the real Cold War. Their influence runs counter to the many, many cries from hawks to impose tough economic sanctions on Russia, as if the giant Eurasian power were a small “rogue state.” The Washington Post, for instance, said in an editorial:

Some argue that the West lacks the means to damage the Putin regime or that the United States cannot act without Europe, but neither claim is true. Banking sanctions—denying Russians and their banks access to the U.S. financial system—could deal a powerful blow. Mr. Obama must respond to Mr. Putin with measures that force the Russian ruler to rethink his options.

But, as CNN reports:

Russia is the European Union’s third-biggest trading partner after the United States and China, with goods and services worth more than $500 billion exchanged in 2012. About 75% of all foreign direct investment in Russia originates in EU member states, according to the European Commission. In addition, Russia is the single biggest supplier of energy to the European Union. British energy firm BP is the second-largest shareholder in Russia’s leading oil producer Rosneft, and some of the biggest energy companies in Germany, the Netherlands and France are invested in a joint venture with Russian gas giant Gazprom.

And, in a lengthy interview in The American Interest, Zbigniew Brzezinski points with regret to the fact that British bankers, who have large deposits of Russian cash—particularly from Russian oligarchs—are resisting any sort of confrontation over Ukraine:

The British seem inclined to argue, “Well, there’s a lot of Russian money in our banks.”… The bankers doubtless have a lot of influence, particularly in political systems in which money is increasingly the mechanism that oils the “democratic process.”

Earlier, the BBC had reported that a document carried by a top British official read: “The U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London’s financial center to Russians.”

The New York Times, in a long March 7 piece analyzing US and European business interests in Russia and their effect on the politics of the situation, quoted several executives with Western firms who clearly want to cool the crisis talk:

European businesses “have no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine,” Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday. “We call upon all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, which will secure stability, welfare and economic growth on the European Continent.”

Among American companies cited in the Times are Pepsi, Ford and John Deere. The Times quoted Ken Golden, director of global public relations for Deere, in its piece:

While Russia represents less than 5 percent of Deere’s total equipment sales, the company recently cited Russia as being key to its future growth. “We urge political leaders to solve this issue without violence and in accord with international agreements,” Mr. Golden said.

It even extends to the defense industry. According to Defense News, in a piece titled “Amid Ukraine Crisis, EU Plays It Safe,” various European arms manufacturers, including in Sweden, value current and potential sales to Russia. France is apparently insisting that it will continue to sell arms to Russia, including a $1.7 billion deal for two Mistral-class helicopter carriers. Said one expert quoted in the piece:

It looks like the Europeans are extremely keen to do everything except anything that hurts their commercial interests. There is zero appetite to hurt business interests, and arms sales fit into that category.

Still, while Vladimir Putin and his nationalist Russian base might believe that ancient monasteries, the Kievan Rus and heaven knows what else justify the illegitimate annexation of Crimea and Russia’s overweening influence in Ukraine, and that Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine need protecting, Moscow’s actions in Ukraine are nearly certain to contribute to a deeper political divide between the United States and Russia. Just as the unilateral US and NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1998–99, the illegal US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the US-NATO war against Libya in 2011 all bolstered Russian nationalism and strengthened the Russian military, Russia’s occupation and pending annexation of Crimea will do the same in reverse. Hawks, pro-NATO militants, supporters of building up US military forces and missile-defense systems in Eastern Europe, and critics of President Obama’s defense cuts, will all be aided greatly by Putin’s actions.

We’ll review the bidding on that tomorrow.###353||Empty###354||The announcement comes after Alibaba struggled to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve a proposed governance structure that would allow its partners to nominate a majority of its board of directors.

A listing in China may be considered “should circumstances permit in the future,” the Hangzhou- based company said in an e-mailed statement.

Investment banks have valued Alibaba, founded by former English teacher Jack Ma, at as much as $200 billion (€144bn), which would make it the second-biggest internet company behind Google Inc, based on market capitalisation.

A US share sale by Alibaba would be a blow to Hong Kong, which hasn’t hosted an IPO of more than $4bn since October 2010.

“Alibaba’s preference to keep its partnership structure is probably the biggest reason why it chose to list in the US,” Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd said yesterday. “The US has more investors and analysts in the technology space.”

Alibaba plans to work with Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company hasn’t signed official contracts with the banks for the initial public offering, the person said.

Representatives of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Spokesmen for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank weren’t immediately available to comment.

Alibaba hasn’t decided when to file for the listing, how much it plans to raise, how large a stake it may sell or which exchange in the US it would seek to list on, according to the person familiar with the matter.

“This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency,” Alibaba said in the statement. “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong.”

The prospectus for an initial public offering may be disclosed as soon as April, people familiar with the matter have said.

The company is also working with New York- based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

An Alibaba IPO could raise about HK$100bn (€9.26bn), Ernst & Young LLP has said, making it the world’s biggest first- time share offering since Facebook raised $16bn in May 2013.###355||Empty###356||Empty###357||Empty###358||We have detected that you do not have JavaScript enabled.

( ) has published a maiden resource for its Picachos project in Chile, which it estimates can cover the first 3-5 years of production from an open pit.

The total tonnage is 7.1Mt at 0.85% copper and 7.6 grams per tonne (g/t) silver at a cut-off grade of 0.2% for copper, but within this is a high grade zone of 3.4Mt at 1.12% copper.

The company added there is scope to boost the total as the resource only covered a small part of the tenement.

( ) said grades have started to improve at its Evander mine in South Africa after a tough six months.

Revenues in the half year fell by 20% to £68.1mln, while net earnings were £5.5mln (£17.3mln).

( ) told investors all five of its projects are now active - as joint ventures with AIM peer Metal Tiger at the Morogoro gold prospect and the Pinewood uranium portfolio have kicked off.

( ) shares advanced as it ran through the aspects, now ticked off, of a pre-feasibility study on its vanadium project in Limpopo Province, South Africa.

The study on the project, where the firm is currently focusing attention, is on track to be finished during the first half of 2015, it confirmed.

Meanwhile, the application for a mining right is on track to be submitted in the first quarter this year.

( , ASX:FTE) has applied to the ASX to have its shares delisted in a bid to cut listing and compliance costs.

On the funding front, ( ) says the completion of a £4.9mln placing unveiled last November is on track as it announced the receipt of the third and final tranche.

The cash is planned to be mainly used on its flagship Tulu Kapi project in Ethiopia to the point in mid-2015 where it is planned that full development funding be arranged.

( ) has struck a share deal with a UK mining support firm Minesweeper, in which it will subscribe for up to A$1mln of shares in the Australia-listed firm.

Under the share investment agreement (SIA), Condor has placed shares worth A$249,000 with Minesweeper at $0.001 a share and the proceeds of this will be used for general working capital and Chile costs.

In board room news, ( ) has appointed geologist and mining veteran Michael Foster to the board as a non-executive director.

Foster is currently a director of CASA Mining Limited, a private company with interest in exploration licences in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and was previously non-executive chairman of Copperbelt Minerals.

Following the shareholder vote earlier this week Nicholas Gay and Neeve Billis have taken up their positions as non-executive directors of ( ).

At the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Wednesday the appointments of Gay and Billis were both approved by shareholders. Gay won 60.94% of the vote, while Billis was narrowly approved with 50.14%.

Elsewhere in the energy sector, ( ) shares advanced as the company said it expects in the near future to significantly increase its gas reserves in Tanzania.

A government pipeline project is now due to be commissioned in the second quarter, and once operational it will provide a route to market and unlock the gas within Wentworth’s Mnazi Bay field.

It will enable a portion of Mnazi Bay’s 639bn cubic feet of contingent gas resources (P50) to be reclassified as reserves.

Wentworth owns some 31% of Mnazi Bay.

( , TSE:CAZ) has opted out of a proposed joint venture in Reeves County, Texas, as it continues to manage capital spending amid lower oil prices.

The deal with Clayton Williams Energy, agreed in November, would have required Caza to pay for 75% of drilling costs for an initial commitment well.

Canadian Overseas Petroleum ( ) has unveiled a tie-up with African oil firm which is expected to see the new partners invest in new projects.

COPL and Shoreline will each own 50% of the new vehicle which will be called Shoreline CanOverseas Petroleum Development Corporation (or ShoreCan).

ShoreCan will build a portfolio of exploration and development assets in sub-Saharan Africa.

Away from the resources sector, ( ) has received a UK patent for lead compound VAL201 for endometriosis or hormone induced abnormal cell growth in women.

Endometriosis is excessively debilitating, typically seen during a woman’s reproductive years and represents one of the major causes of female infertility.

Based on results in endometrial models, VAL201 has been shown to reduce abnormal endometrial growth, but leave other hormone-induced activities working normally.

Shares in AIM quoted drug discovery firm e-Therapeutics ( ) shot up to a new year high on Thursday as investors apparently eyed the group’s brimming pipeline.

The company noted the rise the group’s share price and said it has continued to observe high levels of productivity from its proprietary drug discovery processes.

It said that, as noted in an earlier statement in November, that it is finding a large number of highly active molecules in cellular screens.

Marketing performance group Ebiquity ( ) has acquired its franchise partner Media Value (MV) for up to €6mln in cash.

The firm has been Ebiquity's partner for media auditing in the Iberian market since 2008 and consists of two divisions: these are a media auditing and benchmarking business to be included in Ebiquity's Media Value Measurement division and a return on investment/effectiveness practice to be included in Ebiquity's marketing performance optimisation division.

MV's unaudited revenue for the year to April 30 last year was around €2.3mln and the purchase is expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full year. The initial consideration is €743,000, which is being satisfied from existing banking facilities.

The maximum consideration is up to €6mln depending on the performance of the MV business in the three financial years ending April 30, 2016.

Photo-Me ( ) shares looked the picture of health this morning after the photo-booth firm sent out a snapshot of its recent performance.

A quick look through the lens shows pre-tax profit in the three months to January was up 12% on the same time last year, while turnover went up 3%.

Accesso Technology ( ) has expanded its ticket sales business as it announced its ShoWare division had won a further 11 contracts across North and South America.

It means the total number of contracts won since ShoWare was acquired in 2014 to 22.

Digital media firm Milestone ( ) said each of its businesses is showing revenue potential as it posted a pre-tax loss in the year to end September, 2014.

For the 12 months to end September, the loss before tax was £1.071mln compared to £980,570 in 2013.###362||China's e-commerce giant Alibaba has reportedly confirmed that it will make its IPO debut in the US to reach the valuation of 130 billion dollars.

Number of trips reaches 10.7 billion in 2013 as the economy recovers from recession and population shifts to the cities

Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time in half a century.

They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013 – the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

“People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “This is a long-term trend.”

Expanding bus and train networks help push the growth.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area’s huge transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

“People want to work and live along transit lines,” Melaniphy said. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.”###369||Libyan Navy Attacks Oil Tanker [Update]

By MarEx 2014-03-12 14:56:00

Libya's parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after rebels humiliated the government by loading crude on a tanker that fled from naval forces, officials said, in a sign of the worsening chaos in the OPEC member state.

Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya's eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed.

Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues.

Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening.

Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya's first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya's anarchic transition since 2011.

Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels.

"The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality," said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said.

State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities.

Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.

But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker.

When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government.

Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire.

"The ship was damaged and it is not moving," he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defence ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time.

It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga.

It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret.

TRANSITION GETS MORE COMPLICATED

Zeidan's exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya's transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions.

Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya's lifeline.

Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail.

Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defence minister gave his oath.

But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports.

Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available.

In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.

Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.

The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.

They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi.

Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi's overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman.

American fruit firm Chiquita and Irish fruit distributor Fyffes have agreed to merge, creating the world's largest banana company. The all-stock deal, valued at $1.07 billion, will create a new company ChiquitaFyffes that will soon control about a third percent of the world's export banana market. Chiquita pretty much dominates North American while Fyffes rules in Europe.

Here are some major takeaways from the deal that makes ChiquitaFyffes the world's top, uh ... banana.

A heavily-concentrated banana industry

Four companies — Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Del Monto — control more than 80 percent of the world's banana sales, according to the UN. Once this merger deal goes through, that number will decrease by one.

This concentration is noticeable not just in the business ranks, but in the actual species of bananas grown. The banana industry largely relies on one single species called the Cavendish, the long yellow offering you know well from trips to the grocery store. While other fruits are diversified — apples, for example, come in granny smith, red delicious, fuji, and many more — the banana industry's reliance on one type leaves the industry vulnerable to certain shocks... like a banana-killing fungus moving to Latin America, where most of the world's banana exports are grown. "Panama Disease" has hurt Asian exports the past few years and is just now spreading to the top banana of Latin American exports. It's a risk for not just the corporation, but also their competitors.###371||The Obama administration said 5 million Americans have now signed up for health insurance through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act, the president signature legislation.

As we reported, the Congressional Budget Office had projected 6 million Americans would sign up for health care by the end of March, the deadline for open enrollment. The pace for sign-ups has quickened, but The Los Angeles Times reports that may not be enough to get to the White House's original target of 7 million. The paper adds:



"If the pace continues, the Obama administration may come close to registering 6 million sign-ups in the first year that Americans are able to get guaranteed health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. "That would still fall short of the goal of 7 million that administration officials had hoped to reach before the botched rollout of the new law last fall. "How many people have actually paid for the health insurance plans they have selected remains uncertain. "Administration officials have not released data on payments. Unofficial estimates from insurance companies and some state-run marketplaces suggest that as many as 20% of consumers in some markets have yet to pay their premiums, although some of those may not yet have been billed."



CNBC reports the Affordable Care Act requires Americans to have some kind of health insurance by March 31 or face a fine of as much as 1 percent of total taxable income.

In a blog post, Marilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the last several days have been some of the busiest for HealthCare.gov. They fielded more than 130,000 calls over the weekend and the site saw more than 4 million visits last week.

"With only two weeks to go, we're continuing to work hard to ensure that every American who wants to enroll in affordable coverage by the deadline of March 31st is able to do so," Tavenner wrote.

Urban Outfitters' first quarter net sales were down 4.2% to $398 million, reports WWD. "BFD," you say, but over at Anthropologie and Free People, two other brands under the URBN Inc. company umbrella, net sales were up 11.7% and 25.7%, respectively.

So what's behind Urban Outfitters' floundering sales? Could it be that shoppers are growing weary of the Philly-based brands distasteful (read: racist) antics (see exhibits A and B)? Perhaps, but CEO Richard Hayne has different scapegoats in mind, including inclement weather and a struggle to resonate with the brand's target consumer: "Sales correlate directly with fashion hits and misses, and I believe the Urban brand has had fewer hits than normal," he says.

The loss compares with a 553 million-euro shortfall in the fourth quarter a year earlier, and exceeded the bank's previous record loss of 10.6 billion euros posted for the third quarter of 2011 on bad Greek debt and other write-downs.

The balance sheet cleanup, which includes more than doubling provisions for bad loans to 9.3 billion euros, comes as the European Central Bank starts a big review of the region's banks. The review will identify weak spots in banks' finances and, if needed, ask them to fix them.

Despite the stunning loss, markets reacted favorably to UniCredit's aggressive balance sheet cleanup, sending shares up 7 percent to 6.48 euros.

The bank said its strategic plan through 2018 would foresee a net profit of 2 billion euros this year, tripling to 6.6 billion in 2018. It includes cutting 8,500 jobs, 5,700 of those in Italy, leading to savings of 700 million euros by 2018.

It also plans to publicly list its on-line bank Fineco, and look at selling its collections platform in Italy to a specialist in the field.

CEO Federico Ghizzoni called 2013 "a turning point," and said the bank was posed to increase lending "and support the real economy in Italy and in Europe."

Unicredit said that its underlying financials were improving. In the fourth quarter, it reported higher net interest income and improved fees and commissions, helping to boost revenues by 5.2 percent to 6 billion euros.###378||Failed Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is allowing users to log in to their accounts once again, nearly three weeks after it filed for bankruptcy protection.

Some users reported seeing accurate balances, but on various forums users were, however, concerned that the exchange's website had been hacked and the new log-in facility on the site may be a hoax.

[ Get the skinny on the state of the cloud with InfoWorld's "Cloud Computing Deep Dive" special report. Download it today! | Cut to the key news for technology development and IT management with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter, our summary of the top tech happenings. ]

"We believe this is an authentic notice on the website and we are confirming with the legal team," a call center staffer said on Tuesday.

Another staffer had earlier said that she was unable to say whether the reactivated log-in was the result of an order by the Tokyo District Court, adding the database cannot be accessed while the case is being investigated by the court. Lawyers for Mt. Gox could not immediately be reached.

The notice on the website, which was said to have been posted Tuesday by the call center, invited users to log in to check their bitcoin wallet balances. It's the first access since the Tokyo-based exchange went offline Feb. 25 and later announced it had lost some 850,000 bitcoins.

Some users noted that the reopened access only confirms what they knew before the exchange's meltdown and that their coins remain in limbo.

"The site shows the coins, but it indicates it has no real meaning with respect to claims," said Aaron G., an investor who did not want his last name to be used. His balance indicates about 464 bitcoins (roughly $286,700 according to average bitcoin prices on other exchanges).

"So, just numbers on a screen -- just as 'real' as they were before Gox went down," he said in an email interview.

Aaron, who filed a fraud complaint against the exchange with Tokyo police, was referring to the legalese on the page citing Mt. Gox's pending status under Japan's Civil Rehabilitation Act.

"Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users," the exchange said on its website.

"I can see the 10k Mtgox stole from me... hooray!" a Reddit user posted in reaction to the reactivation of the log-in.

The Mt. Gox website said it will post a method for filing claims as soon as it is in a position to do so, without providing details.

The move follows the exchange's filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28 with liabilities of ¥6.5 billion ($63.6 million), when it said 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins were missing, along with 100,000 of its own. Users were left wondering whether they will ever get their bitcoins back.

The rehabilitation procedure is one of several legal actions involving Mt. Gox and its parent company Tibanne, led by Mark Karpeles. Last week a U.S. district court judge ordered a freeze of the assets of Karpeles as well as Tibanne and Mt. Gox's U.S. subsidiary amid allegations of fraud.

Gregory Greene filed the Chicago lawsuit against Mt. Gox on Feb. 27, alleging he lost around $25,000 worth of bitcoins in the exchange's meltdown.###379||Empty###380||Enrollment in ACA Exchanges Reaches 5M, Tavenner Says

On Monday, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner announced that as of Sunday at least five million people had enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act's federal and state-operated insurance exchanges, the New York Times reports (Pear, New York Times, 3/18).

According to Tavenner, nearly 800,000 people enrolled in coverage during the first two weeks of March, which indicates that enrollment rates are surging in the final days of the open enrollment period that ends on March 31 (Somashekhar, "Post Politics," Washington Post, 3/17).

Last week, HHS reported that about 940,000 U.S. residents had enrolled in health plans through the exchanges throughout the entire month of February, bring total enrollment in the health insurance marketplaces by the end of February to 4.2 million (California Healthline, 3/12).

In an HHS blog post, Tavenner wrote that "[t]he last several days have been the busiest since December" 2013 for the exchanges. She noted that a federal exchange hotline number received more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone. In addition, HealthCare.gov -- the federal health insurance exchange website -- received more than four million visits last week, while another one million people visited the site during the weekend ("Post Politics," Washington Post, 3/17).

The two-week enrollment surge brings total exchange enrollment closer to the Congressional Budget Office's February projection that at least six million people will enroll in exchange health plans by the end of March. CBO previously estimated that about seven million people would sign up for coverage through the exchanges, but analysts reduced the figure primarily because of the troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov last fall (Corbett Dooren, Wall Street Journal, 3/17).

Meanwhile, Tavenner's announcement on Monday still did not include some key data that would provide a clearer picture about actual coverage rates and the success of the exchanges.

For example, it is not clear:

How many of the new enrollees are between the ages of 18 to 34, a demographic seen as essential to the law's success;

How many new enrollees were previously uninsured (Morgan, Reuters, 3/17); and

How many of them had paid their first month's premiums ("Post Politics," Washington Post, 3/17).

Such data are key in determining how many individuals actually have gained coverage and benefit from the law (California Healthline, 3/14).

As expected, China has widened the daily trading band for the yuan’s value against the dollar. For the most part, economic circles are greeting the move with a yawn, though the consensus is that this could slow (or just maybe even stop) the Chinese currency’s long, upward crawl in the near term.

First of all, there seems to be agreement that this isn’t a very big deal in the grand scheme of things. This, because the central bank will still set its desired “parity rate” (the level that determines the center of each day’s trading band, now widened to 2% above or below the parity rate).

Société Générale China economist Wei Yao says: “Widening the band is a relatively easy promise to deliver. The more difficult and more meaningful one is for the People’s Bank of China to really let go its control over the exchange rate.”

Likewise, Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams says: “If the PBOC was really confident that the renminbi [another name for the yuan] was now close to its market value, it would leave the reference rate to the market. But that still, apparently, remains a step too far.”

While the move may be small potatoes to some, many economists also say it’s not completely without consequence. Generally, they see the change to the trading band as more likely to weigh on China’s currency than to send it rising faster.

Although Standard Chartered said the wider band “does not have direct implications for medium-term yuan appreciation or depreciation dynamics,” it adds that the change makes their previous target for the yuan look “a little aggressive.”

As a result, StanChart now sees the dollar buying 6.02 yuan at the end of the third quarter, up from 5.98 yuan previously. On the other hand, the bank’s year-end projection remains at 5.92 yuan.

Over at Daiwa, they’re taking a stronger view that the yuan will now weaken — you can read the details of this argument in Craig Stephen’s “This Week in China” column.

J.P. Morgan also sees a weaker yuan, but just for the near term (they keep their year-end forecast at 5.95 yuan). They note that the last time the trading band was widened in 2012, the yuan fell in value for a short while. And certainly, we’ve seen some pullback for the yuan this month already.

Of course, any weakening in the Chinese currency helps Chinese exporters, and J.P. Morgan says a softer yuan would also stop those pesky hot-money inflows that has worried the PBOC recently. So maybe this is a good thing, for China at least.

After months of negotiating and a series of hearings, the Senate Banking Committee announced today that it has reached a bipartisan agreement on a housing finance reform proposal that intends to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Spearheaded by Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID), the bipartisan reform proposal includes measures from Committee Members of both parties, the Administration and stakeholders.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen the economy,” said Chairman Johnson in a statement. “This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs, while preserving fair and affordable housing throughout the country.”

A key principle included in the proposal involves protecting taxpayers from bearing the cost of a housing downturn by winding down government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which would invite the return of private capital to the housing finance market.

Other key facets include ensuring that affordable, 30-year fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages continue to be available; provide equal access for lenders of all sizes to the secondary market; as well as facilitate board availability of mortgage credit for all eligible borrowers.

Reverse mortgages appear to be protected against any further reforms to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), as the proposal from Congressmen Johnson and Crapo does not include language regarding reform of the Federal Housing Administration.

Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo are currently in the midst of putting finishing touches on draft legislative text that they plan to release publicly in the coming days. The two congressmen also plan to hold a markup in the coming weeks.

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” said Ranking Member Crapo in a statement. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with on private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable.”

MILAN, Italy -- European car sales grew for a sixth consecutive month in February but remained at a low level as the market recovered slowly from the financial crisis.

The European carmaker's association said Tuesday that sales of new passenger cars in the EU grew 8 per cent last month to 861,058 units.

While the result is further evidence that the European market is coming out of its longest contraction ever, analysts warn price discounting remains strong.

Carlos Da Silva of IHS Automotive notes that the positive cycle compares with "dreadful" lows recorded in six years of contraction and "the overall situation remains more tense that it might appear." February's sales were at the second-lowest level ever for the month.

Among major markets, only France saw sales contract, by 1.4 per cent.###396||A currency is only as safe as the bank that stores it. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the recent turmoil in the bitcoin community.

One the primary advantages of bitcoin, perhaps even the greatest advantage of the cryptocurrency, is the ability to do away with traditional banking institutions. By providing an option to transfer payments peer-to-peer at low cost and with great ease, bitcoins allow the currency user full autonomy in not only how he uses his cash, but also how others use it along the payments system. Indeed, the initial marvel of the bitcoin protocol from a purely technological point-of-view was the solution to the double-spending problem when making payments using a peer-to-peer system.

On 7 February of this year, Mt. Gox – a bitcoin exchange which essentially functioned as a depository (i.e., bank) for bitcoins – halted all withdrawals in the crypotcurrency. At the time I wrote two articles making a pretty clear case for Mt. Gox operating like a run-of-the-mill fractional-reserve bank (here and here).

Fractional-reserve banks that existed before the advent of deposit insurance were constrained by some real pressures as they decreased their reserves. As depositors became less sure that they would be able to access their deposits on demand, they would start demanding the fractional-reserve bank’s services at a discount to its competitors. As depositors started withdrawing their funds and endangered the liquidity and eventual solvency of the bank, the bank would react by either halting withdrawals outright (as Mt. Gox did on February 7), or temporarily delaying them while remunerating the client with an interest payment (i.e., enact a “option clause”, something Mt. Gox effectively did by charging clients an extra fee if they wanted their withdrawals expedited.)

The claim that Mt. Gox was operating with fractional reserves came as shocking to some. After all, the exchange functioned by providing a shared wallet for depositors. Each time a deposit was made in bitcoin, the proceeds were moved to the shared wallet. This wallet was safely stored offline (“cold storage”) so that hackers could not gain access to them. In addition, a very high percentage of bitcoin was supposedly stored in this way – up to 98% by some claims – with only a small amount held online to facilitate withdrawals and other transactions.

In theory, since almost all of the bitcoin were held safely offline by Mt. Gox, the “bitcoin bank” should have been behaving like any standard full-reserve bank. The evidence over the past months proved this to be anything but the reality of the situation.

On 28 February Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, with its liabilities amounting to about 2.65 trillion Japanese Yen ($25 billion) more than its assets. Also unaccounted for were about 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins and 100,000 of its own bitcoins. This amounted to 7% of the total bitcoins in existence at the time, with a dollar value of nearly $500 million.

Mt. Gox believes “there is a high possibility that the Bitcoins were stolen.” As far as I am concerned, it doesn´t matter too much if the bitcoins were stolen by a third party, or used in some way by Mt. Gox as would be the case with most other fractional-reserve banks. The fact of the matter is that the bitcoins are not in the vault, and that has created the difficulties the exchange´s clients currently find themselves embroiled in.

Of course, it wouldn´t be the first time that a bank had its bitcoins stolen. Flexcoin – a Canadian outfit that actually referred to itself as a “bitcoin bank” – has just closed its doors for good. Apparently 896 BTC (over half a million dollars) were removed from its online storage. Hackers attacking coins held online are a continual and well-noted threat to the bitcoin community. For this reason many exchanges, like Mt. Gox and Flexcoin, secured their bitcoins in cold storage, an unconnected hard drive safe from the dangers lurking online.

Indeed, Flexcoin has pledged to return all bitcoins that it held in cold storage provided that the identity of their true owner is confirmed. All at no cost, no less!

Mt. Gox is a little different. Despite holding the vast majority of its bitcoin securely in cold storage, its claim is that somehow these were stolen by someone. In standard fractional-reserve banking theory, the reason a less than 100% reserve is held is because the bank has knowingly made use of the deposited goods, not because hackers have prevailed in cracking an impervious safe. The dust will settle on what happened to the bitcoins deposited with Mt. Gox. For now I will let Occam´s razor prevail in providing me with an answer to the whereabouts of the missing coins.

It´s neither here nor there what happened to the lost bitcoins. (Unless you are one of the unlucky ones who entrusted them to a bitcoin bank and lost them.) The real lesson is that the actual good used as “money” is largely inconsequential relative to the banking system that manages it.

Bitcoin has been heralded as a free-market alternative form of money. We should hope so! Away from the central control of any one government, the cryptocurrency is an example of a free market´s response to an imperfect publically provided good. This great achievement of bitcoin is largely lost on those who have lost their savings because of a fractional-reserve bank.

When banks operate with fractional-reserves, whether those reserves are defined in fiat currency, bitcoins or gold, bad things happen. At the very least, that should be the real lesson we can take away from the misfortune befalling the empty-pocketed depositors of Mt. Gox.

Building permits were up at 1.018m vs 0.960 expected. Meanwhile, from earlier, Strategists at TD Securities noted that the HM Treasury announced two new Deputy Governors for the BoE this morning. â€œBen Broadbent had been the favorite to replace Charlie Bean as Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, and will start in that role on July 1, which will require a search for a new external member of the MPC to replace Broadbent's spot. Nemat Shafik comes from the IMF and replaces Paul Fisher as Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, to start August 1. Both will sit on the MPC and FPC, with Nemat Shafik representing the BoE at international functions and provides the first woman on the MPC since Kate Barker in 2010. She also brings her IMF experience managing the European response, which was something the BoE was keen to bring in. In terms of her voting bias, you really don't have much to go on as she has never been in that role, though the expectation would be a cautious attitude on Europe, which remains a large downside risk for much of the MPC. The final piece of the voting puzzle for the coming year, when the BoE is expected to begin tightening, will have to wait for the appointment of a new external member.

As the multinational hunt entered day six for the Beoing 777 aircraft,which suddenly disappeared from radar early Saturday morning while carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, no solid leads about its whereabouts have been found so far.

"We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found," Li said at a press conference in Beijing. "We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images."

The Chinese government, he said, urges all parties involved in the search to enhance coordination so as to locate the missing plane as soon as possible.

Among the 227 passengers aboard the ill-fated plane, 154 are Chinese. Beijing has launched an all-out search and rescue mission, with eight vessels scouring waters around MH370's last confirmed location and 10 satellites providing technological support in the space.

The China Maritime Search and Rescue Center said Thursday that Chinese search teams searched 23,282 square km of waters as of 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) Wednesday and will cover 19,768 square km on Thursday.

The latest clue emerged Wednesday evening when China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said a Chinese satellite has found three floating objects at a suspected site.

The images, which were captured around 11 a.m. Sunday, show that the objects measure 13 by 18 meters, 14 by 19 meters and 24 by 22 meters, respectively, said SASTIND, adding that the discovery is being analyzed.

According to the agency, the objects were spotted in the South China Sea at 6.7 degrees north latitude and 105.63 degrees east longitude and spread across an area with a radius of 20 km.

It remains unclear whether the suspicious items originate from the missing plane. Previously detected pieces of debris have all turned out to be false alarms.

In yet another twist of the mystery around MH370, Malaysian Air Force chief Rodzali Daud told reporters in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday that an unidentified object was plotted on military radar at 2:15 a.m. Saturday over the northern Malacca Strait.

The last definitive sighting on civilian radar was recorded around 1:30 am on Saturday, less than an hour after the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur, as it flew northeast over Vietnamese waters.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," Daud said.

The air force chief denied reports that military radar tracked MH370 flying over the Strait of Malacca, but he did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft might have turned back before disappearing.

In order to help unravel the mystery and find the plane as soon as possible, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has proposed sending an expert team to Malaysia.

Malaysia's special envoy, Ong Ka Ting, said the Malaysian government will give priority to China's proposal and open a communication channel between the aviation authorities of the two sides swiftly.

More than 80 ships and planes from around a dozen contributors are now combing the waters on both sides of the Malaysian peninsula to locate the missing plane.

The most urgent task now is to speed up the search and rescue operations, said Guo Shaochun, head of a Chinese task force, at a press conference held in the Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur.

He also urged the Malaysian side "to listen carefully to the next of kin of the Chinese passengers and take swift actions to respond to the needs of the families."

Malaysia Airlines said it has deployed a total of 112 care-givers to provide the family members of MH370 passengers and crew "with emotional support and ensure their basis needs are met to try and make this difficult time relatively bearable."

In its latest statement, the carrier said the MH370 and MH371 flight codes will be retired from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing route "as a mark of respect" to the passengers and crew of the missing plane.

###402||Empty###403||KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA—Officials revealed a new timeline Monday suggesting the final voice transmission from the cockpit of the missing Malaysian plane may have occurred before any of its communications systems were disabled, adding more uncertainty about who aboard might have been to blame. The search for Flight 370, which vanished early March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, has now been expanded deep into the northern and southern hemispheres. Australian vessels scoured the southern Indian Ocean and China offered 21 of its satellites to help Malaysia in the unprecedented hunt.

With no wreckage found in one of the most puzzling aviation mysteries of all time, relatives of those on the Boeing 777 have been left in an agonizing limbo. Investigators say the plane was deliberately diverted during its overnight flight and flew off-course for hours. They haven’t ruled out hijacking, sabotage, or pilot suicide, and they are checking the backgrounds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors. Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out that it might be discovered intact.

“The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,” Hishammuddin said at a news conference. Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words heard from the plane by ground controllers — “All right, good night” — were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. Had it been a voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course. Malaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner’s data communications systems — the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System — had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers. However, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS — which gives plane performance and maintenance information — came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier. The new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane’s transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.

Airline pilots in the United States cautioned against reading too much into what little is known so far about the actions of the Malaysia Airlines crew. “You can’t take anything off the table until everything is on table, and we don’t even have an aircraft,” said Boeing 737 pilot Mike Karn, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.

Article Continued Below

Authorities have pointed to the shutdown of the transponders and the ACARS as evidence that someone with a detailed knowledge of the plane was involved. But Bob Coffman, an airline captain and former 777 pilot, said that kind of information is probably available on the Internet. Authorities confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot’s home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot in what Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar initially said were the first police visits to those homes. But the government, which has come under criticism abroad for missteps and foot-dragging in releasing information, issued a statement Monday contradicting that account, saying police first visited the pilots’ homes as early as March 9, the day after the flight disappeared. Coffman said the flight simulator could signify nothing more than the pilot’s zeal for his job. “There are people for whom flying is all consuming,” he said, noting some pilots like to spend their off-duty hours on simulators at home, commenting on pilot blogs or playing fighter-pilot video games.

Although Malaysian authorities requested that all nations with citizens aboard the flight conduct background checks on them, it wasn’t clear how thoroughly they were doing such checks at home. The father of a Malaysian aviation engineer aboard the plane said police had not approached anyone in the family about his 29-year-old son, Mohamad Khairul Amri Selamat, though he added that there was no reason to suspect him. Malaysia’s government sent diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking more planes and ships for the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help. The search involves 26 countries and initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. Hishammuddin said Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, and that countries from Australia to China in the north and Kazakhstan in the west had joined the hunt.

Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado’s Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year — even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are “very hopeful” of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama’s administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be “significantly affected in both directions” by various factors.

A “possible increase in initial demand” could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

“We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts,” said Brohl.

NEW YORK, United States — Stock analysts are eyeing a potential turnaround at Urban Outfitters, but remain uncertain on its timing.

On Monday the retailer, whose brands include Free People, Anthropologie, its namesake and others, reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents per share on revenue of $905.9 million. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected earnings of 55 cents per share on revenue of $909.2 million.

Looking to the first quarter, CEO Richard Hayne said in a statement that customer reaction to its new spring assortment at Anthropologie and Free People has been strong but that it remains cautious about the company's first-quarter performance because of ongoing challenges at its namesake brand.

Urban Outfitters brand sales declined during the fourth quarter and climbed at Anthropologie and Free People.

Jefferies' Randal Konik said in a client note that he believes the Urban Outfitters brand will turn around during the second half of the year. The analyst feels that once this happens and Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People are all doing well, the retailer's stock will benefit.

Konik kept a "Buy" rating and $54 price target.

Ike Boruchow of Sterne, Agee & Leach is taking more of a wait-and-see approach. The analyst thinks the company's first-quarter profit margins will likely be pressured by ongoing struggles at its namesake brand. Boruchow said it's too unclear when that will improve, so he's remaining on the sidelines with a "Neutral" rating. The analyst lowered Urban Outfitters' price target to $38 from $42.

Citi Investment Research's Oliver Chen also believes that better results are needed from the Urban Outfitters brand to help drive a recovery and push earnings higher.

The analyst reaffirmed a "Neutral" rating and trimmed the retailer's price target to $41 from $43.

Shares of Urban Outfitters Inc. fell $1.89, or 5 percent, to $35.62 in morning trading.###407||Doktor Zoom's real name is Marty Kelley, and he lives in the wilds of Boise, Idaho.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

###410||There are two weeks to go in the first-ever open enrollment period for buying private insurance coverage as part of the federal health law commonly known as Obamacare. After March 31, Connecticut residents won’t be able to buy individual-market health plans for this year, unless they go through a change in circumstances like losing a job or getting divorced (and no, getting sick doesn’t count).

Here’s what you need to know about the deadline, how you can qualify for a special enrollment period if something changes and you need coverage after March 31, the penalty for not having insurance and how to get an exemption from the individual mandate.

If you have a question about Obamacare, email Mirror health reporter Arielle Levin Becker at alevinbecker@ctmirror.org.

What is the March 31 deadline for?



March 31 is the last day to buy individual-market private insurance in Connecticut for 2014. That applies to health plans sold by the health exchange and those sold outside the exchange.

(Because of inaccurate information provided by the companies, last week’s Q&A incorrectly said that at least one company would continue selling insurance to individuals after March 31. In fact, none will, unless you have a change in circumstances that qualifies you to buy insurance outside the open enrollment period.)

But the deadline does not apply to small-group insurance plans. It also doesn’t apply to people who qualify for Medicaid, who can sign up at any time during the year.

What if I lose my job after March 31? Would I be unable to buy insurance?

No, you would be able to buy insurance because losing your job is considered a “qualifying life event” that allows you to sign up for insurance even if the open enrollment period for the year has ended. Other qualifying events include getting married or divorced, having a baby, moving to another state or, in some cases, changes in income.

People who have a qualifying event and want to buy insurance can request a “special enrollment period” to sign up for coverage. That would give them 60 days from the date of the qualifying event to buy insurance.

How do you get a special enrollment period to sign up for coverage after March 31?

The easiest way for people who want to buy coverage through the exchange to request a special enrollment period is to use the Access Health call center (1-855-805-4325), said Chad Brooker, policy and legal analyst at Access Health.

You will probably be asked to submit documentation to prove why you qualify for the enrollment exception, such as a letter confirming that your job no longer provides health care or a letter saying you no longer qualify for Medicaid.

People will also still be able to browse health plans through the exchange’s website after March 31, Brooker said.

People who qualify for special enrollment periods can also purchase insurance sold outside the exchange.

I’m working on my tax returns now. Do I need to do anything to prove that I have insurance?

No. The individual mandate didn’t take effect until this year so your taxes for 2013 are not affected.

I’m thinking of not getting insurance and paying the penalty. What do I need to know?

The penalty for 2014 is 1 percent of your income above the tax return threshold or $95, whichever is higher. (For most people, it will be 1 percent.) The penalty will increase in subsequent years.

If you have coverage for part of the year, you’ll owe a prorated penalty. It’s calculated based on the number of months you didn’t have coverage, with each month costing you 1/12 of the full-year penalty. So if you’re uninsured for six months, you’d owe half of 1 percent of your income.

If you’re uninsured for fewer than three consecutive months, you won’t have to pay a penalty.

Another thing to note: According to federal regulations, if you have insurance for at least one day in a given month, you are considered to be insured for that full month and wouldn’t owe a penalty for that month.

What happens if you don’t pay your penalty? The federal government can’t issue a lien, but it can deduct the amount from any refund you’re owed, according to the IRS.

I think I’m exempt from the individual mandate. How do I get out of paying the penalty for not having insurance?

In most cases, you’ll have to apply for an exemption through Connecticut’s exchange. (Brooker said Connecticut is the only state handling its own exemption process. The other states are relying on the federal government to do it.)

To apply for an exemption, you’ll have to fill out this form. (You can find it on the Access Health website, www.accesshealth.com, by clicking the “Can I opt out?” tab on the bottom right corner of the homepage.)

A team at the exchange will review the submitted forms and any supporting documents people include and determine if they meet the requirements for an exemption. For those who qualify, the team will also determine whether they will be granted an exemption for the full year or for part of the year.

One group that doesn’t need to apply for an exemption: People who don’t have enough income to be required to file a federal income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service has said people in that category, who are not subject to the individual mandate, don’t have to take any action to get an exemption.

There are several circumstances in which someone could be exempt from the individual mandate. They are:

If you’re uninsured for fewer than three months of the year;

If coverage is unaffordable to you — that is, if the cheapest option available would cost more than 8 percent of your household income;

If your income is too low for you to be required to file a tax return (in Connecticut, many people in this category would qualify for Medicaid);

Belonging to a federally recognized tribe;

Being a member of a recognized health care sharing ministry;

Being a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance, including Social Security and Medicare;

If you’re incarcerated;

If you’re not in the country legally.

In addition, people could potentially qualify for a “hardship exemption” from the mandate if any of the following affected their ability to buy health insurance:###411||The deal is part of Vodafone’s drive to become a leading unified communications provider in Europe

Vodafone is to buy Spanish cable operator Ono for €7.2 billion (£6 billion).

The acquisition is part of Vodafone’s strategy to become a leading unified communications provider in Europe. It follows the operator’s purchase of German cable company Kabel Deutschland in June last year, and Cable and Wireless Worldwide in April 2012.

Ono is the largest high-speed broadband provider in Spain, and has 1.9 million customers.

Vodafone will finance the transaction using exiting cash resources and “committed but undrawn bank facilities”, it said. In September last year, Vodafone sold its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless to US telecoms group Verizon Communications for £79 billion – which analysts predicted will be used to acquire broadband and TV assets across Europe. So far it has spent an estimated £12.4 billion, leaving it with £66.6 billion.

The operator is rumoured to be in talks with BSkyB over a possible acquisition, although Vodafone Group Chief Executive Vittorio Colao has played these down by saying he does not see the need for a ‘quad-play’ (fixed-line, mobile, broadband and pay-TV bundles) in the UK at the moment.

On the Ono purchase, Colao said: “Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.”###412||Empty###413||Investing.com -

Investing.com - Gold and silver prices were higher on Tuesday, as lingering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine and growing fears over the health of China's economy continued to support safe haven buying.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery held in a range between $1,338.10 a troy ounce and $1,349.20 an ounce.

Gold last traded at $1,347.90 an ounce during U.S. morning hours, up 0.48%, or $6.40. Gold futures advanced 0.25%, or $3.30 an ounce, on Monday to settle at $1,341.50.

Prices were likely to find support at $1,319.30 a troy ounce, the low from February 28 and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery picked up 0.6%, or $0.12 cents, to trade at $21.03 a troy ounce. Silver ended Monday's session down 0.09%, or $0.01 cents, to settle at $20.91 an ounce.

Silver futures were likely to find support at $20.61 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $21.61, the high from March 7.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

Gains were limited amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually reduce the pace of its asset purchase program.

Data released last week showed that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.

The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the Fed is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

Market players will be anticipating what will be closely-watched U.S. data on retail sales and consumer sentiment later in the week for further indications of the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery inched up 0.5% to trade at $3.046 a pound.

Copper plunged to an eight-month low of $2.995 a pound on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.###414||WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. - A Metro-North worker from Yonkers was killed Monday after being struck by a train on the Harlem line, according to a report in the New York Daily News.

Emerging market economies took a battering in January amid ongoing concerns about political upheaval, slowing growth and U.S. monetary policy, prompting some central bankers and policymakers to scramble for a response.



Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and India all tightened monetary policy in an effort to stem a reversal in capital inflows – which had boomed since the U.S. Federal Reserve started its bond-buying program in 2008. The Fed announced that it would begin tapering off its stimulus in December 2013.



The OECD's Composite Leading Indicators showed a downward trend for BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China) excluding China, signaling a cyclical slowdown.



Growth in emerging market economies could be hit as the U.S. continues to scale back its asset purchases, and as investors focus on their vulnerabilities, the OECD said, adding that high levels of debt left some vulnerable to financial shocks.



"There remains a risk that the financial market volatility and strong capital outflows in recent months in some emerging economies could again intensify, exerting an additional drag on growth," it added.



Developed economies



By contrast, the OECD's Composite Leading Indicators show a strengthening growth momentum in the U.S., euro zone, Japan and the U.K.



The U.S.'s cyclical recovery was "relatively well established," according to the OECD, but it warned that growth looked set to slow as a result of the recent bad weather.

The organization forecast annualized gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.7 percent in the first three months of 2014 and 3.1 percent in the second quarter, after the U.S. government slashed estimates for fourth-quarter GDP to 2.4 percent.

Both the U.S. and Canada were expected to experience an "uneven pattern of growth in the near term, owing in part to the disruptive effect of repeated episodes of severe winter weather," the OECD added.



Meanwhile, the organization forecast the U.K.'s economic growth to expand from 2.9 percent in the final quarter of 2013, to 3.3 percent in both the first and second quarter or this year.



It expects the euro zone's economy to continue to expand (by 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, before slowing to 1.4 percent in the second quarter) but warned the pace of growth was slower than elsewhere.###417||Choose the plan that’s right for you.

* India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan say know nothing about the plane

* China says Malaysia must immediately expand search

By Anshuman Daga and Yantoultra Ngui

KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Reuters) - The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane - an informal “all right, good night” - was spoken after the tracking system, known as “ACARS”, was shut down.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status - had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”

FOCUS ON CREW

The plane vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off its communications systems as the plane flew across the Gulf of Thailand.

Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: “We are looking at it.” But it was only one of the possibilities under investigation, he added.

Intensive efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the airplane had not, as of Monday, turned up any information linking anyone to militant groups or anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the aircraft, U.S. and European security sources said.

One source familiar with U.S. inquiries into the disappearance said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the ACARS system.

Many experts and officials say while the jet’s transponder can be switched off by flicking a switch in the cockpit, turning off ACARS may have required someone to open a trap door outside the cockpit, climb down into the plane’s belly and pull a fuse or circuit breaker.

Whoever did so, had to have sophisticated knowledge of the systems on a 777, according to pilots and two current and former U.S. officials close to the investigation.

Malaysian police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practise flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.

Some U.S. officials have expressed frustration at Malaysia’s handling of the investigation. As of Monday morning the Malaysian government still had not invited the FBI to send a team to Kuala Lumpur, two U.S. security officials said.

The FBI, which has extensive experience in investigating airplane crashes, and other U.S. law enforcement agencies have indicated they are eager to send teams to Kuala Lumpur, but will not do so unless formally invited.

VAST SEARCH CORRIDORS

Police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests it could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.

Aviation officials in Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan - as well as Taliban militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan - said they knew nothing about the whereabouts of the plane.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbour to immediately expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin said diplomatic notes had been sent to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force were also searching the southern corridor, he said, and U.S. P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft were being sent to Perth, in Western Australia, to help scour the ocean.

NORTH OR SOUTH?

Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia.

A source familiar with official U.S. assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor.###419||Numericable insists its SFR offer is the 'most compelling'

The net loss widened from €553 million a year earlier and exceeded the €10.6 billion loss the bank reported in the third quarter of 2011. UniCredit took a charge of more than €9 billion on intangible assets, including goodwill writedowns at its Austrian unit, the Milan-based bank said in a statement on Tuesday.

Chief executive officer Federico Ghizzoni plans to eliminate 8,500 jobs and sell assets to strengthen UniCredit’s finances as part of a five-year plan announced on Tuesday. The lender is targeting €2 billion of net income in 2014 as Italy begins to emerge from a recession and stricter capital requirements imposed by regulators restrain earnings. The bank set aside €9.3 billion for bad loans in the fourth quarter, double the amount of a year before.

“Thanks to the additional provisions booked, UniCredit now has by far the highest impaired loan coverage ratio of the Italian banking system and amongst the best in Europe, in line with pre-crisis levels,” Ghizzoni, 58, said in the statement.

UniCredit rose as much as 2.2%, after initially declining following the release. The stock was up 2.1% at €6.17 by 3:05 pm in Milan trading.

‘Visibility Moment’

The bank proposed a stock dividend of 10 cents a share for 2013, though shareholders will have the option of requesting cash. UniCredit paid a nine cent-a-share cash dividend on 2012 earnings.

UniCredit raised its bad-loan coverage ratio to 52% on 31 December as the European Central Bank (ECB) began examining the balance sheets of the euro area’s largest banks.

“This is the visibility moment we were hoping for and will force investors skeptical on the asset quality of the bank to look at it from a different standpoint,” Andrea Filtri, a London-based analyst at Mediobanca SpA, said in an emailed comment after Tuesday’s release.

Revenue in the quarter rose 5.2% to €5.98 billion, boosted by higher income from lending and trading. The bank booked a €1.2 billion capital gain from the revaluation of its 22% stake in the Bank of Italy.

UniCredit is planning an initial public offering (IPO) of a minority stake in its Internet bank unit Fineco SpA as part of its business plan, the company said. Fineco offers Internet banking and wealth management, focusing on consumers. The unit has 2,400 financial advisers, 900,000 customers and manages €40 billion of assets, according to the bank’s website.

Cutting Jobs

It’s also seeking offers for UniCredit Credit Management Bank SpA, a unit that manages non-performing loans, as Italy’s banks consider ways to move bad loans off their books, people familiar with the talks have said.

UniCredit said it had €699 million in restructuring costs in the quarter as part of a wider plan to reduce the workforce. Job reductions will lead to €300 million in savings in 2016 and €700 million starting from 2018. Some 5,700 jobs will be cut in Italy, the lender said.

The ECB is working with local regulators on a yearlong asset quality review of the loan and trading books of about 128 of the euro region’s largest banks. Those that fail will need to raise capital, seek mergers or be wound down.

Capital Ratio

Europe’s political leaders asked the Frankfurt-based ECB to take over supervision of the region’s banks starting this November to shore up confidence in an industry hurt by a swathe of taxpayer-funded bailouts during the financial crisis.

More than 20 auditors were scheduled to start on-site inspections at UniCredit on Monday, the Bank of Italy said in a document last month.

The lender’s common equity ratio under fully-applied Basel 3 rules, a key measure of financial strength, was 9.4%. Bloomberg###425||MARCH 16 ― I know many of you have submitted questions, and I will try to answer some of those questions in my statement today.

Every day brings new angles, especially as we are refocusing and expanding the search area ― and as always, we have a responsibility to release only information that has been corroborated and verified. We cannot respond to every request immediately, so I ask you to bear with us.

1. Search area

As the Prime Minister said yesterday, the operation has entered a new phase. The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult.

The search area has been significantly expanded. And the nature of the search has changed. From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans.

The number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25, which brings new challenges of co-ordination and diplomacy to the search effort.

This is a significant recalibration of the search.

The search and rescue operation continues to be a multi-national effort, one led and co-ordinated by Malaysia.

In the last 24 hours, the Prime Minister has spoken to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Turkmenistan, the President of Kazakhstan and Prime Minister of India.

Yesterday the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia briefed representatives from countries along the northern and southern corridors.

At 2pm today, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia briefed representatives from 22 countries, including those along the northern and southern search corridors, as well other countries that may be able to help. These include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia.

Malaysian officials are requesting support from these countries ― as well as others. This support includes general satellite data, radar playback ― both primary and secondary ― provisions for ground, sea and aerial search, and assets as appropriate.

We are currently discussing with all partners how best to deploy assets along the two search corridors. At this stage, both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance.

We are asking countries that have satellite assets, including the US, China and France amongst others, to provide further satellite data. And we are contacting additional countries who may be able to contribute specific assets relevant to the search and rescue operation. Surveillance aircraft are required, and maritime vessels are needed, particularly for the southern corridor.

2. Police investigation

As the Prime Minister said yesterday, up until the time the aircraft left military primary radar coverage, its movements were consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane.

I cannot comment on speculative theories as to what might have caused the deviation from the original flight path, as I do not wish to prejudice the on-going investigation.

I understand the hunger for new details. But we do not want to jump to conclusions. Out of respect to the families, and the process itself, we must wait for the investigation to run its course.

The Malaysian authorities are refocusing their investigation on all crew and passengers on board MH370, as well as all ground staff handling the aircraft.

Yesterday, officers from the Royal Malaysia Police visited the home of the pilot. They spoke to family members of the pilot and experts are examining the pilot’s flight simulator. The police also visited the home of the co-pilot. According to Malaysian Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together on MH370.

I would like to stress that Malaysia has been working with international law enforcement agencies since day one.

3. Aircraft maintenance

Malaysia Airlines has confirmed that the aircraft was subjected to the required maintenance programme: the Boeing Maintenance Planning Document. Checks are done according to this programme. The aircraft had been fully serviced and was fit to fly.

4. New involvement

The Inmarsat team arrived yesterday and will support the investigations team, which includes the Malaysian authorities, and the UK and US teams.

5. Concluding remarks

I would like to conclude by reiterating that the search for MH370 has entered a new phase.

The information released yesterday has provided new leads, and given new direction to the search process.

We will provide more detail on the redeployment of assets when it becomes available. Facts must be corroborated and verified before being released.

When possible, we will keep the media fully briefed, but our priority remains the search and rescue operation. To that end, we have been engaged in diplomatic and investigative efforts over the past 24 hours.

The company also will offer a $500 cash allowance to owners who want to buy or lease a new GM vehicle.

In a release posted Thursday on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Web site, GM said the cash offer is good toward any 2013-2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac.

The notice says that GM will begin around April 7 to make repairs to the recalled vehicles, which include model years 2005-07 Chevy Cobalts; 2007 Pontiac G5s; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevy HHRs; and the 2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.

The loaners will be available until parts arrive to fix the switches. The cash offer runs through April 30.

GM says it isn’t offering to buy the cars back, but the cash offer will be made to people who don’t feel safe driving their cars.

GM is recalling 1.6 million older small cars because faulty ignitions can shut off engines unexpectedly. GM says 12 people have died in crashes linked to the problem.###427||Empty###428||Colorado collects $2 million in pot tax from January sales

Colorado collected slightly more than $2 million in taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana in the month of January, according to new figures released by the state Monday.

The numbers are the first time an official tally has been put on the value of the historic January sales. But they are also below the amounts that previous estimates have predicted Colorado could reap from the sale of marijuana to anyone 21 and older.

In January, Colorado collected $1.4 million from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana, plus another $416,690 from the state's standard 2.9 percent sales tax, according to a news release Monday from the Colorado Department of Revenue. Extrapolating from those figures, it means recreational marijuana businesses that submitted tax returns in January did slightly more than $14 million in retail sales during the month.

Recreational marijuana businesses paid another $195,318 in excise tax during January, which will be put toward school construction.

Sales at medical marijuana businesses generated another $913,519 in sales tax for the state during January.

In total, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January, according to the news release. Twenty-four businesses were approved to be open for sales on Jan. 1, according to the release.

That marks just a fraction of the eventual size possible for Colorado's recreational marijuana industry. As of the end of February, state officials have given approval to 167 stores for recreational sales, though not all of those stores will have received the necessary local approval also needed to open.

Still, the January revenue figures put the industry on pace to come in below previous estimates. Both Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's budget office and legislative analysts have predicted recreational sales for the first six months of 2014 would top $190 million. Instead, if January's figures hold, sales for the period would hit only $84 million.

Excise taxes - paid on the wholesale price when marijuana is transferred between the grower and the seller - are also running behind predictions.

Hickenlooper has proposed putting the money from recreational marijuana taxes toward drug-addiction treatment and youth drug-use prevention. Lawmakers, who are currently setting next fiscal year's budget, have said they want to wait for more numbers before making a final decision.###429||Mt. Gox hackers post Bitcoin balances on CEO’s own blog

Given how much Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has lost, both in terms of money and trust, it was only a matter of time before hackers struck back. Now such a group of enraged victims have hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ own blog to reveal just how much the company really lost.

Mt. Gox’s fall from grace is a matter of public knowledge, but the true extent of the damages incurred by the company is unsurprisingly kept behind closed doors. In fact, the entire company’s strategy in dealing with its financial, and now legal, problems were supposed to be a secret until a “crisis strategy draft” document was leaked.

The document details the steps the company needs to take in order to appear less culpable, starting from inexplicably disappearing from the Internet, stepping down from the Bitcoin Foundation board, issuing a vague statement explaining the disappearance, and filing for bankruptcy, all of which took place the past weeks. Also notable in that document was the admission that Mt. Gox lost as much as 744,408 bitcoins due to a bug, amounting to around $340 million at that time. It seems, however, that the real, undisclosed figures are far worse.

Hackers dived into Mt. Gox’s database not to steal bitcoins, or so the hackers said, but to get their hands on databases that will reveal the truth. With a hint of poetic justice, these same hackers used Karpeles’ blog to post database dumps and other files that they were able to acquire. Among those is a list of the actual Bitcoin balances, which revealed the real number to be 951,116 bitcoins. That amount is a far cry from that in the leaked document as well as the numbers given by Mt. Gox itself when it filed for bankruptcy.

Karpeles’s blog has been taken down now but, under the exhortation of the hackers, the data has been mirrored and made available elsewhere for others to see and review, including anonymized user accounts and their balances. Although the hackers claim that no user database dump has been made public, the incident demonstrates how Mt. Gox’s security can be so easily compromised, which is how it ended up in trouble in the first place.

The Chinese satellite captured images of what are believed to be “three suspected floating objects and their sizes,” CNN reports. The pictures were taken on March 9, one day after the plane went missing, but were not released until March 12.

The sizable objects in question were found in the water, south of Vietnam, and northeast of where the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: CIA Investigates Possible Pilot Suicide

CIA officials are also investigating the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and the director of the agency revealed earlier on March 10 that a possible suicide attempt by the pilot could have brought down the missing plane.

“I think you cannot discount any theory,” CIA head John Brennan said when asked if it was possible that the pilot deliberately crashed the Boeing 777.

This theory could explain how the plane “disappeared” from civilian radar tracking its movements. The pilot could have simply turned off the transponder shortly before it disappeared. We hope this tragic mystery is solved soon.

“It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,” Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed’s tapering of its stimulus programme. “Given the fact that we’ve embarked on measured reductions, it’s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we’re doing. It’s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.”

The Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.

New York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a “reasonably favorable” outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a “considerable time.”

The US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.

No Whip-Saw

Improvement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.

Policy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,” Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were “encouraging,” though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,” he said.

Yellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.

The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn’t find work.

Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank’s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg

© AFP 2014/ Philippe Huguen

16:07 18/03/2014

MOSCOW, March 18 (RAPSI) – Germany’s Constitutional Court held Tuesday that various proceedings challenging the European Stability Mechanism were inadmissible or unfounded, according to a statement released by the Court.

The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was established in 2012 to provide financial assistance to member states within the euro area experiencing financial difficulties.

European bailout funds are financed through the ESM, which can lend up to EUR 500 billion total, The Economist reported in October. At the time, EUR 100 billion had reportedly been earmarked for the recapitalization of Spain’s financial sector, and EUR 9 billion had been set aside for Cyprus, leaving EUR 391 billion total.

As reported by Bloomberg, the ruling came as part of a complex web of cases brought by politicians and academics upset with Germany’s handling of the EU debt crisis.

“These cases once again show how the political and financial tackling of the crisis has been challenged all European and German institutions… It’s still imperative to find a sustainable, realistic, democratically founded and constitutional way leading out of the crisis,” Judge Andreas Vosskuhle said while delivering the ruling, according to Bloomberg.

According to the court statement, although some of the complaints involved in the ESM actions have been dismissed, the court noted the imperative of ensuring that arrangements are made under budgetary law to: “ensure that possible capital calls pursuant to the ESM Treaty can be met fully and in time within the agreed-upon upper limits, so that a suspension of Germanyâ€™s voting rights in the ESM bodies is reliably excluded.”###435||Business News

US stocks dip on weak China, Japan data

Published on: Tuesday, March 11, 2014

by AAP



US stocks have slipped as weak economic data from China and Japan raised questions about the growth outlook in Asia.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.04 (0.21 per cent) to 16,418.68.



The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.87 (0.05 per cent) to 1,877.17, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 1.77 (0.04 per cent) to 4,334.45.



Earlier, Asian and most European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.



“Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.



Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.



Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.



“Stocks have had a pretty good move,” James said. “Traders were kind of positioned to take profits.”



Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded home builders Meritage Homes and KB Home, citing pressure on profit margins. KB Home fell 4.1 per cent, while Meritage shed 3.5 per cent.



Boeing experienced the deepest losses among the blue chips, dipping 1.3 per cent after a Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner jet made an emergency landing in Honolulu, reportedly due to a possible problem with its hydraulic system.



The news followed a Friday Boeing disclosure that hairline cracks were found in the wings of some of its Dreamliners in production, due to a manufacturing problem.



Chiquita Brands International jumped 10.7 per cent after announcing a merger with Fyffes to create the world’s largest banana company. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 per cent of the new company.



Fuel cell stocks were hot ahead of company earnings reports this week. Fuel Cell Energy, which will release earnings Tuesday, rose 11.3 per cent, while Plug Power, which reports Thursday, jumped 24.7 per cent.



Bond prices were mixed. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slipped to 2.78 per cent from 2.79 per cent, while the 30-year edged higher to 3.73 per cent from 3.72 per cent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.

March 17, 2014

Australia has accepted a request from Malaysia to take charge of the "southern vector" of the search for Malaysia Airlines MH370, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Monday.

Abbott said that during a recent phone call with Prime Minister Najib Razak he had offered additional surveillance resources to bolster the two Australian Orion aircraft already searching for the plane.

"He asked that Australia take responsibility for the search in the southern vector, which the Malaysian authorities now think was one possible flight path for this ill-fated aircraft," Abbott told parliament.

"I agreed that we would do so."

The search for flight MH370 is focusing on a wide strip of territory either side of two arcs formed by satellite plots of the aircraft's last known possible position.

The southern Indian Ocean is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest, posing potentially enormous challenges for the international search effort.

The northern vector of the search stretches through Thailand and China and bends towards India, Pakistan and then Central Asia, over some of the world's most strongly guarded countries.

Abbott said Australian Defence Force chief David Hurley was in discussion with his Malaysian counterparts about how best to deploy the additional resources, without providing further details, in the search for the Boeing 777.

On Sunday, Australia shifted one of its two Orion aircraft searching for the missing plane further south in the Indian Ocean, at Malaysia's request. The aircraft is now searching the ocean to the north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The second Orion is continuing to search west of Malaysia.

Australia has a military over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) network, which allows it to observe all air and sea activity north and northwest of Australia for up to 3,000 km (1,860 miles).

However, the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN), which has radar capability extending into the Indian Ocean, does not operate on a 24-hour basis, according to Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) documents.

JORN is used primarily to provide defence surveillance of Australia's northern approaches but does not continually "sweep" an area like conventional radars. Instead, it "dwells" on a selected area.

Australia's civil aviation radar extends a maximum of 200 nautical miles (410 km) off the coast, a civil aviation authority source said, and is used only for monitoring scheduled aircraft on approach into the country and subsequent landings.

Asked before his parliamentary statement whether any Australian agencies had found information to suggest the plane might have come close to Australia, Abbott said: "I don't have any information to that effect."

"But all of our agencies that could possibly help in this area are scouring their data to see if there's anything that they can add to the understanding of this mystery."###438||The day of reckoning is coming for the Affordable Care Act, widely called Obamacare. March 31, the day nearly every American is supposed to have health insurance, is fast approaching. And judging from the government's February enrollment numbers, many uninsured people still have not signed up.

While these numbers surely will be higher by the end of March, it's a safe bet that millions still will be without coverage and subject to a tax penalty for failing to buy a policy.

The idea behind the Affordable Care Act was to bring health insurance to more Americans but not through a universal national health system like other countries have, where everyone is covered as a matter of right. Instead, Congress wanted to give more Americans the right to buy an insurance policy on the private market. After March 31, nearly everyone will be required to have insurance through Medicare, Medicaid, an employer, the military or a state shopping exchange.

To make this private market work and keep premiums reasonably low, insurance companies needed a good mix of healthy and sick people. If there were too many sick people and not enough healthy ones enrolled, insurers wouldn't collect enough in premiums to pay for the claims of those who had high medical expenses. As a result, insurance companies would raise their rates, and premiums would go through the proverbial roof.

To solve that problem, everyone is required to have insurance or pay a tax penalty, which kicks in next year unless Congress delays it. The House of Representatives voted to do that last week, but its bill has no chance of becoming law because the Senate won't pass a similar bill, and the president would veto it anyway.

The penalty is pretty weak, and it may not be big enough to make everyone buy coverage. For some families, it might be cheaper to pay the penalty and skip the insurance. Of course, they won't have any insurance protection if they do that.

What exactly is the penalty? Like most things in the Affordable Care Act, even the penalty is not straightforward. For the first year, it's $95 for each adult in a family up to $285, or 1 percent of family income. The penalty increases each year until it reaches $695 per person or 2.5 percent of family income in 2016 and afterwards.

When the penalty is fully phased in, here's how it will work: one full penalty per each adult in the family and an additional half-an-adult penalty per child. The penalty cannot exceed $2,085 if it's assessed as a flat rate. If it's a percentage of income, it can't exceed the cost of a bronze plan, the cheapest type of policy sold in the exchange.

But the tax penalty assessed through your income taxes may not be the biggest tax surprise. The subsidies Congress made available to coax families with low and moderate incomes to buy expensive health insurance have a pretty big string attached. It's called the "clawback," and very few consumers who've received a subsidy through a state exchange know what can happen. Health researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, UCLA and the Economic Policy Institute estimated that nearly 40 percent of families might be affected by the clawback.

How does the clawback work? A family's subsidy is based on last year's tax return. When they apply for a subsidy, the family must make its best guess about their income for the current year. That may be tough for self-employed people or those with seasonal jobs. If the family's income increases during the year the family receives its subsidy — say a family member gets a raise — they will have to pay back some of the subsidy they've received.

Their tax return will show they owe the government money it paid the insurance company on their behalf, and families will have to dig into their pockets to pay it back. The money will be "clawed back" to the government.

This arrangement also might work in a family's favor. If their subsidy turns out to be too low relative to their income for the year, say if a family member lost a job, then the family's next tax return will show a tax refund.

What's the backstory? When the law was written, Congress had to find a way to pay for the subsidies and needed to raise money from other sources in the federal budget. One way was to raise some $22 billion by requiring small firms to report more of their business transactions. They complained, and Congress chose to make up the lost revenue from the very people who received subsidies in the first place.

Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, summed up the dilemma: "Many Americans are going to be shocked to discover when they figure up their taxes at the end of the year that what they thought was a grant (to help pay their premiums) was in fact a loan."

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about how to spend the windfall.

Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.

Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s not clear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s JBC plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another JBC member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.###440||The leaders of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday announced an agreement on legislation to wind down government-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, jump-starting a long-standing debate that could still take years to resolve.



Shares of both financiers fell sharply after the announcement. Fannie's shares were down nearly 25 percent in late afternoon trading. See what Fannie shares are doing now and see the latest updates on Freddie shares here.

Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a Democrat, and Senator Mike Crapo, the panel's top Republican, outlined the plan in bullet point format after months of talks that included input from the Obama administration. They said they intended to introduce a bill soon, with an eye to having the panel vote on it within weeks.

(Read more: UniCredit to 'focus on growth' after shock loss)

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee 60 percent of all U.S. home loans, provide a steady source of mortgage funds by buying loans from lenders and packaging them into securities they sell to investors with a guarantee.

Their central role in the mortgage market led the government to bail them out to the tune of $187.5 billion in the midst of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and lawmakers want to make sure taxpayers are never on the hook again.

Under the outline from Johnson and Crapo, private interests would take the first 10 percent of any mortgage losses, before an industry-financed government backstop would kick in.

"This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie, while protecting taxpayers," Crapo said in a statement.

(Read more: Co-Op Group CEO resigns)

Analysts cautioned, however, that the lawmakers face an uphill battle in trying to enact legislation this year. Any bill that clears the Democrat-led Senate would have to win approval in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where some lawmakers want a fully private system.

"This is another step towards reform, but we are still years away from having either the legislative capacity or market willingness to embrace a new mortgage finance system," said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst with Compass Point Research and Trading.

Under the proposal, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be wound down and replaced with a new government reinsurer called the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corp. The new entity, which would be funded by user fees, would issue a federal guarantee for mortgage bonds that would kick in only after private creditors had taken a hit.

Included in the outline is a mandate that strong loan underwriting standards be built into the new system.###441||Charleston, SC (29403)

The Cabinet plan issued Sunday calls for raising the share of China's population of almost 1.4 billion people living in cities to 60% from 53.7% now, a shift of about 90 million people.

The ruling Communist Party sees allowing people to migrate into cities for higher-paid jobs as a pillar of more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

China's evolution from a mostly rural society began with market-oriented economic reform in the 1980s. Cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have grown to become among the world's largest but migrants are hampered by a household registration system that binds them to their hometowns. That limits access to schools, health care and pensions even for those who live in cities for years.

Sunday's announcement of the "National New Type Urbanisation Plan" for 2014-2020 gave no financial or other details. But plans announced earlier call for improving housing for 100 million people who live in dilapidated shantytowns.

"Domestic demand is the fundamental impetus for China's development, and the greatest potential for expanding domestic demand lies in urbanisation," the report said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

The ruling party has promised in its latest five-year development blueprint to make the economy more productive by giving entrepreneurs and market forces a bigger role and overhauling banking and other industries.

The urbanisation plan says railways will reach cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020 and those with more than 500,000 people will be linked by high-speed rail, according to Xinhua.

It promises to pursue a "human-centred and environmentally friendly path," according to Xinhua.

"A scientific and reasonable urban development model should be adopted, with green production and consumption becoming the mainstream in urban economic activities," it said. "China should strive to push for harmonious and pleasant living conditions."

Longer-term, authorities expect 300 million people from the countryside to become city dwellers by 2030, the equivalent of migration by the entire United States population.

The latest plan promises to give permanent urban status to 100 million rural migrants, according to Xinhua.

A study by Tsinghua University in Beijing found only 27.6% of China's people have urban status with full claims to education, health and other public services, while hundreds of millions of city dwellers with rural status have limited benefits.###444||Empty###445||George Soros and Carl Icahn both hold stakes in it, but controversial US firm Herbalife has come under consistent fire from rival investor William Ackman over its allegedly dubious operations.

Now it’s being investigated by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over claims it might be running a “pyramid scheme”.

The key accusation against Herbalife, which makes weight loss and nutritional supplements and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is that it makes most of its money from signing up new distributors rather than from sales.

Herbalife’s shares dropped by as much as 17% following the news.

Herbalife itself said the following in a statement: “Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC.

“We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

So what’s going on?

Activist investor Ackman has taken a $1bn position against Herbalife, and long called it a “pyramid scheme”.

This week his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management made further allegations that Herbalife was violating direct sales regulations in China.

But up until this week’s news, Herbalife stock has been performing quite nicely.

Soros may have reduces his stake in the company last year, but he didn’t pull out: he still holds stock through his firm Soros Fund Management.

Icahn still owns nearly 17%, according to the BBC, and been going head-to-head with Ackman over his allegations.

Vodafone has placed a big bet on the recovery of the Spanish economy by agreeing to buy Ono, a high-speed broadband provider, for £6 billion.

The acquisition is the British company’s first major play since selling its American joint venture to Verizon Wireless for £84 billion last September — a deal that left Vodafone with a war chest of up to £24 billion.

The latest deal, which has been in Vodafone’s sights since January, continues a rapid consolidation in the European telecoms industry. Vivendi last week said that it was entering exclusive talks with Numericable, the French cable company, over the sale of SFR, the mobile operator . A deal could be worth €11 billion.

In company news, Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ( HTZ ) shares rose as much as 8% Monday following reports the car rental company is planning to spin off its construction-equipment rental subsidiary.

The Financial Times reported HTZ is close to a final decision on spinning off Hertz Equipment Rental Corp, either through a distribution of shares to shareholders or possibly a reverse Morris trust, which combines and spin-off and a merger. The potential deal would value the construction-equipment unit - one of the largest of its kind in the United States and Canada, HTZ asserts - at around $4.5 billion, the newspaper said.

The segment generated $1.39 billion in revenues during the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2012, and another $1.1 billion through the first nine months of FY13, according to the company's regulatory filings.

HTZ shares were up 5.3% at $27.35 each in recent trade, climbing as high as $28.08 earlier. The stock has a 52-week range of $19.73 to $29.81 a share.

Concerning appreciation of the euro’s exchange rate, Noyer said he was “not very happy” because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.

The company is confident it is in compliance with all laws and will cooperate with the investigation, Cayman Islands-based Herbalife said today in a statement.

The probe is a win for Ackman, who has said Herbalife misrepresents sales figures, misleads distributors and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. In 2012, Ackman said his New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management LP had sold short 20 million of the company’s shares and started working to try to convince regulators to shut the company down.

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,” the company said in the statement.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) A small, four-rotor drone hovered over Washington Nationals baseball players for a few days during spring training in Florida last month, taking publicity photos impossible for a human photographer to capture. But no one got the Federal Aviation Administration's permission first.

"No, we didn't get it cleared, but we don't get our pop flies cleared either and those go higher than this thing did," a team official said when contacted by The Associated Press. The drone flights ceased the next day. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named.

The agency bars commercial use of drones no matter how seemingly benign. The lone exception is an oil company that has been granted permission to fly drones over the Arctic Ocean, and it took an act of Congress to win that concession.

FAA officials say rules to address the special safety challenges associated with unmanned aircraft need to be in place before they can share the sky with manned aircraft. The agency has worked on those regulations for the past decade and is still months and possibly years away from issuing final rules for small drones, which are defined as those weighing less than 55 pounds. Rules for larger drones are even further off.

But tempting technology and an eager marketplace are outrunning the aviation agency's best intentions. Photographers, real estate agents, moviemakers and others are hurrying to embrace the technology. Drones have been used to photograph the two apartment buildings that collapsed in New York City this past week and a car crash in Connecticut. The AP, in fact, is one of several news organizations studying the possible use of drones.

Unless FAA officials receive a complaint or chance upon a news story that mentions drone flights, they have little ability to find out about violations. The ban was further undercut this month when a federal judge dismissed the only fine the FAA has imposed on a commercial drone operator. The judge said the agency can't enforce regulations that don't exist.

The FAA, which contends it controls access to the national air space, has appealed.

The use of commercial drones, most of them small, is starting to spread to countries where authorities have decided the aircraft presents little threat if operators follow a few safety rules.

The drone industry and some members of Congress are worried the United States will be one of the last countries, rather than one of the first, to gain the economic benefits of the technology.

"We don't have the luxury of waiting another 20 years," said Paul McDuffee, vice president of drone-maker Insitu of Bingen, Washington, a subsidiary of Boeing. "This industry is exploding. It's getting to the point where it may end up happening with or without the FAA's blessing."

In Japan, the Yamaha Motor Company's RMAX helicopter drones have been spraying crops for 20 years. The radio-controlled drones weighing 140 pounds (63.5 kilograms) are cheaper than hiring a plane and are able to more precisely apply fertilizers and pesticides. They fly closer to the ground and their backwash enables the spray to reach the underside of leaves.

The helicopters went into use five years ago in South Korea and last year in Australia.

Television networks use drones to cover cricket matches in Australia. Zookal, a Sydney company that rents textbooks to college students, plans to begin delivering books via drones later this year. The United Arab Emirates has a project underway to see whether government documents like driver's licenses, identity cards and permits can be delivered using small drones.

In the United Kingdom, energy companies use drones to check the undersides of oil platforms for corrosion and repairs, and real estate agents use them to shoot videos of pricey properties. In a publicity stunt last June, a Domino's Pizza franchise in the U.K. posted a YouTube video of a "DomiCopter" drone flying over fields, trees and homes to deliver two pizzas.

But when Lakemaid Beer tried to use a drone to deliver six-packs to ice fishermen on a frozen lake in Minnesota, the FAA grounded the brewskis.

Andreas Raptopoulous, CEO of Matternet in Menlo Park, California, predicts that in the near term, there will be more extensive use of drones in impoverished countries than in wealthier nations such as the U.S.

He sees a market for drones to deliver medicines and other critical, small packaged goods to the 1 billion people around the globe who don't have year-round access to roads.

Later this year, Matternet plans to start selling to government and aid organizations a package that includes a drone and two landing pads. On the return trip, the drones can carry blood samples bound for labs and other packages.

Germany's express delivery company Deutsche Post DHL is testing a "Paketkopter" drone that could be used to deliver small, urgently needed goods in hard-to-reach places. Facebook is in talks to buy Titan Aerospace, a maker of solar-powered drone-like satellites, to step up its efforts to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world.

There is also a strong business case for urban drones that can replace truck deliveries of single packages. "If you look at the economic footprint and CO2 emissions," Raptopoulous said, the drone "beats the truck hands down."

Worldwide sales of military and civilian drones will reach an estimated $89 billion over the next decade, according to the Teal Group, an aerospace research company in Fairfax, Virginia. The FAA estimates as many as 7,500 small commercial drones will be in use within five years once the necessary regulations are in place.

Jim Williams, head of the FAA's drone office, said writing rules for the U.S. is more complex than other nations. The U.S. has far more air traffic than anywhere else and a greater variety of aircraft, from hot air balloons and old-fashioned barnstormers to the most sophisticated airliners and military and business jets. At low altitudes, the concern is a small drone could collide with a helicopter or small plane flown by a recreational pilot.

"It's a different culture in the U.S. and Canada," Williams said in an interview. "People believe they have the right to just jump in their airplane and fly just like they do their car. ... We can't set up a system that puts any of those folks at risk."

Yet the FAA permits hobbyists to fly model aircraft that have so improved in technology that they're little different from small drones. The FAA has issued voluntary guidelines for hobbyists, including staying away from airports, flying no higher than 400 feet and staying within the line of sight of the operator.

"You could go off to the hobby shop, buy a little remote control helicopter and fly it to your heart's content," McDuffee said. "But if you hung a digital camera on that, took pictures of your neighbor's roof and sold those pictures to him or her, now you are in business and you're flying" an unmanned aircraft system.

Sean Cassidy, senior vice president at the Air Line Pilots Association, said he worries that commercial drone users will be less willing than hobbyists to abide by restrictions because of economic pressures.

Drones are "becoming so prevalent and affordable that something has to be done to make sure they're not being used in a reckless manner," he, said. "Even a fairly small (drone), if the person flying this thing is unaware of their surroundings ... there could be very dire consequences."

U.S. investigators now suspect the aircraft stayed airborne for about four hours past the time it reached its last confirmed location, according to the publication's sources.

The WSJ referenced engine data which its sources claim indicates the plane continued to fly for hours beyond its last known location.

A total flight time of five hours could put the flight's final destination at the Indian Ocean, the border of Pakistan or even the Arabian Sea, the WSJ claimed in a tweet.

The report came as Malaysian authorities said they had failed to find any evidence of wreckage at a potential debris site identified by Chinese satellites.

Debris search fruitless

The missing Boeing 777-200ER sent at least two bursts of technical data back to the airline before it disappeared, according to the New Scientist magazine.

The Malaysian Insider previously reported that the data may help investigators understand what went wrong with the aircraft, with no trace of Flight MH370 found since it disappeared early on Saturday morning.

In one of the biggest aviation mysteries in memory, dozens of aircraft and vessels from an array of countries, including the US Navy, have failed to find a shred of evidence pointing to the plane's fate.

"Malaysia Airlines has not revealed if it has learned anything from ACARS data, or if it has any," reported the New Scientist, referring to the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which automatically files technical reports during every flight so that engineers can spot problems.

The reports are sent at four stages throughout the flight - during take-off, the climb, at



a point during cruising and on landing - via VHF radio or satellite.

However, in a Malaysia Airlines statement, the airline claimed: "All Malaysia Airlines aircraft are equipped with ACARS which transmits data automatically. Nevertheless, there were no distress calls and no information was relayed."





New Scientist claimed that the maker of the missing jet's Trent 800 engines, Rolls Royce, received two data reports from the now missing flight at its global engine health monitoring centre in Derby, England, where it reportedly keeps real-time monitors on its engines in use.

Investing.com - Gold prices shot up on Wednesday as the Russian standoff in Ukraine escalated and bolstered gold's appeal as a safe-haven during times of crisis.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,368.00 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 1.58%, up from a session low of $1,345.70 and off a high of $1,371.20.

The April contract settled up 0.39% at $1,346.70 on Tuesday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,328.20 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at $1,375.10, the high from Sept. 19.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Wednesday.

Leaders of the Group of Seven largest industrial nations warned Russia on Wednesday not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will meet with U.S. President Barack Obama later in the day, as diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continued.

Still, uncertainty as to how policymakers on all sides will navigate their way out of the crisis fueled safe-haven demand for the yellow metal

The direct seller's shares tumbled Wednesday after Herbalife revealed that it is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for possible "deceptive practices."

Since December 2012 Ackman has spent millions waging a public campaign against Herbalife and building up an army of lobbyists, community organizers and members of Congress to push regulators to investigate what he calls a "pyramid scheme" that makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products they sell. It is a charge that Herbalife has repeatedly denied.

Ackman, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management, holds a whopping $1 billion "short" position in Herbalife, meaning he's bet that the company's stock will drop and profits when it does. While short sellers are sometimes demonized for profiting at another's financial pain, they can play an important role in discovering problems with companies. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital took out a massive bet against Lehman Brothers in 2007, accusing the investment bank of not disclosing all of its potential losses from the housing market downturn. That bet turned out to be right. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, sparking the financial crisis.

So far Ackman's campaign has had mixed success. The SEC began conducting its own investigation into Herbalife shortly after Ackman's initial accusations, but so far it hasn't led to any enforcement action. He sparred publicly with Carl Icahn, who owns 17 percent of Herbalife through his firm Icahn Associates, with Icahn calling Ackman a "crybaby" on television. Icahn has defended Herbalife and increased his stake in the company in recent months to back up his comments. The stock, which was hit hard at the outset of Ackman's crusade, more than recovered, doubling to an all-time high of $83.51 at the beginning of this year.

The FTC news dinged shares 7 percent on Wednesday, as the stock closed down $4.82 at $60.57. But shares are still up 46 percent since December 2012.

Herbalife, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Los Angeles, uses a network of distributors to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products. Other companies, such as Amway, cosmetics companies Avon and Mary Kay and kitchen products maker Tupperware, use a similar network of independent contractors who market merchandise through demonstrations and other personal contacts.

Many people looking for extra income are attracted to becoming direct sellers because there are no large upfront fees. Startup kits range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, according to the website of the Direct Selling Association, a national trade group based in Washington. There were nearly 15.9 million people involved in direct selling in 2012, and their sales rose nearly 6 percent to $31.6 billion that year, the most recent data available from the trade group.

Individual sellers earn money based on how much they sell, and often, the sales of others. But the direct selling industry has been increasingly under a microscope amid charges of deceptive practices by sales reps who have lost money. The Direct Selling Association says it requires its members to adhere to a code of conduct that includes doing business with "transparency" and "consumer protection at the core." The National Consumers League and the Direct Selling Education Foundation distribute a brochure with information on how consumers can protect themselves against pyramid schemes.

Herbalife said Wednesday that it believes it complies with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully with the FTC. It said it welcomes the inquiry given the "tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace" about its business.

The FTC's investigation into Herbalife comes less than two months after Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.,) called on regulators to investigate its business practices, after Markey said he heard complaints from former Herbalife sales representatives about improper pressure and financial hardship stemming from their work with the company. It comes a day after Ackman held a public presentation to detail claims of Herbalife violating laws in China and vowed to pursue his campaign against Herbalife "to the end of the earth." Pershing declined to comment Wednesday on the investigation.

FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan on Wednesday confirmed the existence of the probe but declined to comment further. In a letter this week, SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White said her agency could not confirm or deny if the SEC was still investigating the company.###468||Mystery continued to shroud the Malaysian jetliner six days after it went missing as Vietnam said today that its aircraft and ships have not found any debris said to have been spotted by Chinese satellites.

Aircraft and vessels sent out by Vietnam today found no debris in the waters where Chinese satellites spotted three floating objects in the hunt for the missing Malaysian airlines flight, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Vietnamese Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu as saying.

Vietnam authorities dispatched two aircraft and two ships to fly over the waters off the Vietnam's southern coast where Chinese satellites photographed suspected floating objects, Pham, who is leading a frontline command in Phu Quoc island said.

Earlier today China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said a Chinese satellite has found three floating objects at a suspected site of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane but it was not sure whether it was the debris of the plane. China pressed 10 satellites besides eight ships and three aircraft to conduct search operations. A huge international search operation has been mostly focused on the shallow waters of the Gulf of Thailand off Malaysia's east coast.

Vietnam has been searching off its eastern coast of Phu Quoc island as well as its western shoreline.

The Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea has been included since Sunday but the search there has remained futile so far.

Meanwhile Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has asked Malaysia to step up coordination for search operations.

Without directly referring to Malaysia he said the Chinese government has asked relevant parties to enhance coordination, investigate the cause, locate the missing plane as quickly as possible and properly handle all related matters.

"Hundred and fifty-four of the 239 people on board on the Malaysian plane are Chinese. Those people's families are burning with anxiety. Chinese government and people are all deeply concerned about their safety," Li said here today.

"We are all eagerly awaiting the news of the plane, even the slightest piece of good news," he said minutes after China said its satellites picked up three floating objects between Malaysia and Vietnam which could belong to the Malaysian plane which went missing six days ago.

"As far as there is a glimmer of hope we will not stop searching for the plane," he said. Li also said the incident will not effect any policy changes permitting large number of Chinese tourists to visit abroad.

Over 80 million tourists visited abroad in 2012 spending over USD 102 billion, according to WTO.

While Malaysian officials denied any hint of terrorism in the incident, concerns are rising about the safety of large number Chinese travelling abroad.

"With respect China's opening up policy there will be no change and China will continue to open itself to the outside world," Li said replying to question whether the incident will impact outbound tourism.

"In this course the growing number of Chinese people will make overseas trips. That will place greater responsibility on the shoulders of Chinese government. It will fully perform its duties and enhance cooperation with other countries and regions to ensure safety of overseas nationals," he said.###469||Empty###470||The Bank of England is about to get another deputy governor.

The policy, under which the Bank will not consider raising rates until unemployment has fallen to 7 per cent, has drawn criticism as the jobless rate falls rapidly towards the target.

But the financial data firm Markit’s survey of more than 700 businesses showed 57 per cent of respondents are more confident about the economy thanks to guidance, while one in 10 have brought forward capital spending plans.

But there was also a warning for Mr Carney in the latest evidence of a runaway housing market from the website Rightmove, which revealed the average asking prices of property across the UK hitting a record of £255,962 in March, up 1.6 per cent or £4,000 on last month and beating the previous peak in July last year.

Last week Mr Carney said the Bank was watching the market “very closely”. It can recommend the Government’s Help to Buy scheme be reined in if necessary.

Markit’s research found that construction firms had responded most positively to forward guidance, while manufacturers had also been encouraged to accelerate spending plans. Hiring intentions have also increased, according to the survey. Chief economist Chris Williamson said: “Forward guidance is reported to be having a direct overall positive impact, most notably by boosting investment and hiring intentions.”

This was backed up by the manufacturers’ organisation EEF, which said the positive outlook was leading to record recruitment and investment plans. A survey of more than 300 companies showed strong trading conditions were spreading to all UK regions.

EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said: “This is the most positive set of indicators for some time, demonstrating that we’ve not just turned the corner, we’re actively heading down the right road.”

Rightmove director Miles Shipside meanwhile reported “a greater sense of urgency among buyers”.

“The property market is starting to unlock after years of being handcuffed by fragile consumer confidence and a lack of low-deposit mortgages,” he added.###473||You are using an older browser version. Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.###474||Why did this happen?

Foreign bond sales and weak economy

This latest surge in Fed's monetary creation comes after three months of a significant slowdown in the rate of expansion of its record-high $3.9 trillion balance sheet. Indeed, monthly increases in the monetary base between November and January were brought down from $95 billion to $11 billion.

The question is: What caused this sharp policy reversal since the end of January? There are two explanations.

The first is the yet unconfirmed story that the Fed was picking up Treasury securities that were allegedly dumped by the Russians and the Chinese. The official statistics are not out, but these are the guesses because both governments have been net sellers of American debt instruments during the fourth quarter of last year.

The other explanation has to do with the lingering weakness of the U.S. economy.

In spite of a strong acceleration in the second half of last year to an annual growth rate of 2.3 percent, from a puny 1.5 percent in the first six months, a big slack in labor and product markets is leaving the economy well below its noninflationary growth potential of about 3 percent.

The labor market data for February show little change in the number of people out of work and in the unemployment rate. Adding the involuntary part-time workers and those who dropped out of the labor force (because they could not find a job) to the recorded jobless numbers brings the actual unemployment rate to more than 13 percent, double the officially reported rate of 6.7 percent.###477||The first company to default on a public bond in China’s domestic market also has several trust loans outstanding, according to a Chinese brokerage source, raising the risk that Friday’s unprecedented missed payment may have wider implications.

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology has at least four outstanding trust loans due this year, the source said. The loss-making solar manufacturer failed to pay a coupon on a Rmb1bn (US$163m) bond last Friday, raising questions over its ability to meet its other obligations.

Chaori issued six trust loans in 2011, the source said. The first one, the Rmb80m China Industrial International Trust, was issued on April 21 2011 and matured on October 20 2012. This trust was backed by 5 million Chaori shares held by the company’s chairman Ni Kailu.

The other five financings were arranged by Zhongrong International Trust, with an annual interest rate at about 8.6% and a tenor of three years. The third trust loan comes due on July 31 this year, the fourth on September 5, the fifth on October 19 and the sixth on October 12, the source said, adding the information about the due date on the second trust loan was missing.

There was a cap of Rmb50m on each of the Zhongrong-arranged trust loans, which means the total of outstanding trust loans could amount to as much as Rmb250m. Those loans are most likely backed by shares, sources said.

A failure to honour any of those obligations could trigger a rare default in China’s booming trust market, broadening the impact of Chaori’s situation. A number of trust companies have struggled to repay investors – often including high-net-worth individuals – in recent months, including Jilin Trust, which failed to redeem at maturity in early February.

Chaori also owes 18 banks including China Construction Bank, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China about Rmb1.7bn. These banks have been pressuring the Fengxian government – where Chaori is based – to help with a debt restructuring, according to a research report published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on March 5.

China Securities, the arranger of the Rmb1bn five-year bond issued by Chaori in 2012, will send out a notice later today or tomorrow calling bondholders to a meeting where they will discuss proposals to resolve the default, according to a source from China Securities.

The Shenzhen-listed Chinese solar equipment producer was unable to make an interest payment on March 7 on the 8.98% bond due 2017, marking the first default on a public bond in China.

Trading in the company’s bonds has been suspended since last July after it recorded consecutive losses in 2011 and 2012.###478||The Starbucks app has been good for a while now, allowing you to add gift cards to your account, accumulate points and scan your phone at the register to pay. It's pretty slick and works as quickly and as well as you would want and expect. The company announced that with the upcoming iOS update, you can skip the tip jar and give a bonus to your barista through the app.

It's a small feature, but it's a real sign of how nearly everything is going digital. Of course, like a lot of things, that means a few restrictions. Not that people are very likely to tip more than this, but the app limits digital tips to 50 cent, $1, or $2 increments.

You may not have tipped more than $2, but you might have given extra change, say $1.75. It remains to be see if this will at all short the baristas as people choose $1 over somewhere in between one and two, but people could also be more willing to tip if it's asked in the app they're using.

As I mentioned, this speaks to a trend of everything becoming digital or mobile. More than 11 percent of store transactions are completed with mobile apps such as Starbucks'. And because theirs is efficient as described, Starbucks is the biggest player in that space. There was $500 million dollars of mobile payment transactions in 2012, but the "vast majority" of it was Starbucks.

This is of course due to the prevalence and popularity of Starbucks stores, but also because the app is simple to use and genuinely helpful. The iOS update adding digital tipping coms out March 19, and will be available to use in 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the US.

Aviation investigators and national security officials are basing their theory on data automatically downloaded and relayed to the ground from the Boeing 777’s Rolls-Royce engines, which suggested the plane flew for a total of five hours, The Wall Street Journal reported. It attributed the details to two unidentified sources "familiar with the details".

The missing Malaysia Airlines jet sent two bursts of technical data back to Rolls-Royce, to the plane’s engine maker’s global engine health monitoring centre, before it vanished off the radar, the New Scientist reported on Thursday.

If confirmed, it could aid the protracted investigation looking for clues that might pinpoint the last known movements of the Boeing 777-200ER.

Flight MH370 sent data as it took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, and subsequently during the plane’s climbing phase.

“US counterterrorism officials are pursuing the possibility that a pilot or someone else on board the plane may have diverted it toward an undisclosed location after intentionally turning off the jetliner’s transponders to avoid radar detection,” the WSJ reported, citing “one person tracking the probe”.

The new information raises questions as to how far the aircraft may have travelled after losing contact with air traffic control officials, and whether anyone was in control of the plane, which had 239 people onboard.

Rolls-Royce said today it could not comment on the investigation. “We continue to monitor the situation and offer our support to Malaysia Airlines,” the British engine maker said in a statement.

The manufacturer had on Sunday told the South China Morning Post that it tracks all of its engines and that if there had been a change in power it would know "first hand if there is something wrong with the engine". A spokeswoman said at the time any information they had would be passed to the airline and Malaysian authorities.

Flight MH370's last known position was recorded roughly halfway between Malaysia and Vietnam. Malaysian authorities earlier said that they had tracked what could have been the craft changing course and heading west.

The fresh suspicions come following the publication of pictures by China which appear to show large chunks of debris floating in the sea.

The pictures, posted on a Chinese government department's website, show three large objects in the South China Sea off the southern tip of Vietnam, near to where the flight was last tracked, Xinhua news agency reported.

The images, captured at around 11am on Sunday - more than 24 hours after the plane disappeared - appear to show "three suspected floating objects", the Xinhua report stated.

The largest was estimated to measure 24 metres by 22 metres, Xinhua said.

The images were originally posted on the website of China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

China's Premier Li Keqiang said today work was ongoing to try and identify the "suspicious spots" in the images.

However, the Vietnamese said today that two spotter planes sent to the area had failed to find anything.

It was hoped the images would provide investigators with the first real clue as to the fate of the plane, which disappeared after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Since then, the search has covered 92,600 square kilometers (35,800 square miles), first east and then west of Malaysia and even expanded toward India on Wednesday.

No other governments have confirmed the Xinhua report, which did not say when Chinese officials became aware of the images and associated them with the missing plane.

China's aviation chief Li Jiaxiang said Tuesday: "We have been waiting for a search result, but regrettably there has been no certain outcome yet.

"On one hand, we still have expectations, and sincerely hope that the missing flight can be found, but on the other hand, we have to be prepared for different scenarios.

"We'll never give up when there is a slice of hope."

He said China had made a number of suggestions in relation to the hunt, again urging Malaysia to step up the search and make the exchange of information smoother.

Malaysia’s civil aviation chief, Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said Malaysia had not been officially informed by China about the images, which he said he was learning about from the news.

He said if Beijing informs them of the coordinates, Malaysia will dispatch vessels and planes immediately.

"If we get confirmation, we will send something,” he said on Thursday morning.###481||China Widening the Yuan Trading Value to 2 Percent to Inject Competition Into the Economy

China announced that it is widening the Yuan trading value to 2 percent, allowing the Yuan fluctuate against the dollar and more than double in size each day.

Widening the trading band will help to “optimize the efficiency of capital allocation and market allocation of resources to accelerate economic development,” said a central bank statement.

China Widening the Yuan Trading Value

The modest easing of exchange rate controls has been criticized by Washington and other trading partners, adding to a flurry of reform initiatives aimed at making its slowing economy more efficient.

Leaders of China’s Communist Party are widening the trading value of the Yuan to inject more competition into the sluggish economy and help to nurture an economy that will have more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

Washington and other governments are complaining that by suppressing the value of the yuan, it will unfairly make Chinese exports cheaper abroad and hurt foreign competitors.

The economic growth in China fell to a decade low 7.7 percent last year. This year’s official growth target is slightly lower at 7.5 percent.

Premier Li Keqiang promised in an annual policy speech last week to give market forces a “decisive role” in allocating credit and other resources in the state-dominated economy, so this move was expected.

Chinese leaders say they plan eventually to let the yuan float freely, but private sector analysts say that might be decades away.

Allowing the yuan to rise in value would increase the buying power of Chinese households, helping to achieve the ruling party’s goal of nurturing more sustainable economic growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

A stronger yuan also could help to suppress pressure for politically sensitive consumer prices to rise by making imports cheaper.

Currently 1 Chinese Yuan is equal to $0.16 of the U.S. dollar and the yuan has been trading at about six to the dollar. Analysts say Beijing might allow that to rise to 5.88 to the dollar by mid-2014, a rise of about 2 percent. That would be small by global currency market standards but unusually large for China .

* German judges say parliament’s budget powers safeguarded

* Ruling on ECB’s main anti-crisis measure deferred to EU court

By Michelle Martin and Ilona Wissenbach

KARLSRUHE, Germany, March 18 (Reuters) - Germany’s Constitutional Court upheld the legality of the euro zone’s bailout fund on Tuesday, affirming a preliminary ruling during the debt crisis in 2012 that gave a green light to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

The court reiterated that the 700 billion euro ($975 billion) fund did not violate the rights of Germany’s Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, to decide budgetary matters as long as it had sufficient oversight powers over the ESM.

Klaus Regling, head of the ESM, said in a statement that the verdict was “a good decision” both for Europe and for Germany and added that the court had “provided clarity once and for all” by confirming the overall tenor of its preliminary ruling.

The court said measures had been taken to ensure Germany’s liability to the ESM was limited to 190 billion euros, with any increase subject to a vote by the Bundestag. It also confirmed the legality of the “fiscal pact” for stricter European Union budget discipline, championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who had appeared for the government during the hearings, welcomed the final ruling which he said “confirmed our course for securing the stability of the currency” and boosted confidence in the euro zone.

Among the record 35,000 plaintiffs were lawmakers from Merkel’s conservatives and the opposition, and academics. They argued that the ESM amounted to an illegal transfer of sovereignty from Berlin to Brussels.

Peter Gauweiler, a Bavarian conservative lawmaker who was the most prominent plaintiff, said the lawsuit had succeeded in ensuring democratic controls of the ESM and limiting taxpayers’ exposure to bailouts of over-indebted euro zone members states.

The threat to democratic principles and to the Bundestag’s supremacy in budget matters had “not been fully eradicated, but significantly reduced” by the verdict, Gauweiler said.

The court in Karlsruhe has a history of delaying EU treaties to test their compatibility with German law, usually imposing the condition that parliament has to be consulted fully.

But outside the court a few demonstrators from a group called “Direct Democracy” were dressed as prisoners and slaves to protest at the lack of democratic control of the ESM.

“The taxpayers’ sole purpose now is simply to cough up and then some board of directors whom we haven’t elected decides where our money will go,” 26-year-old Marcus Anton said.

STILL DOUBTS ON OMT

There were no direct comments on the legality of the European Central Bank’s “unlimited” bond-buying scheme, the flagship emergency measure against the debt crisis.

The German court took the unprecedented decision last month to defer a ruling on the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme - which is credited with saving the euro zone - to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg.

That court is seen as less of a threat to the OMT, which was announced by ECB chief Mario Draghi in 2012 and helped to keep the euro zone together by promising potentially unlimited purchases of the sovereign bonds of member states.

The German court could still give its own verdict after an ECJ ruling, which is likely to take over a year. It has already said there was good reason to think the OMT exceeded the ECB’s mandate and violated a ban on the ECB funding governments.

Referring to Tuesday’s decision, Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg bank, said it would have been a major surprise if the Constitutional Court had contradicted its own preliminary verdict from 2012.

“It’s important that we have certainty about the legality of the ESM in the eyes of Karlsruhe because it is central to the financial stability architecture of the euro zone,” he said.

But the court had “created much bigger trouble” with its negative comments on the OMT in February, “because without that, the ESM is simply too small - it is not big enough to defend countries like Spain and Italy”, said Schulz.

Economist Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the Ifo economic think-tank, also said the court’s insistence on Bundestag approval of each ESM transfer would have implications for EU plans for a “banking union” scheme to tackle troubled banks.

It meant that “you can’t use the ESM’s funds as an automatic backstop for this wind-up mechanism if it doesn’t have enough money”, Sinn told reporters.###483||Empty###484||London - Call it the "new neutral."

When Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney begin lifting interest rates from record lows, investors are betting the benchmarks stay below historic averages.

While neither central bank has plans for increases any time soon, improving economies are spurring debate about the appropriate levels for neutral interest rates, which neither stimulate nor slow growth. Interest-rate swaps show the U.S. federal funds rate will crest at 3.1 percent in five years, below the average of 4.8 percent in the 20 years ending 2007, while the key BOE rate tops out at 2.8 percent, about half its long-run average of 5 percent.

"Most people agree that potential gross-domestic-product growth is lower than before the crisis and will continue to be lower for at least a few more years," so central bank benchmark rates also will be lower, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist in New York for Deutsche Bank AG.

Policy makers across the globe adopted emergency measures to stave off financial turmoil following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 and subsequent recessions. At the Fed, these included cutting the rate on overnight loans among banks to near zero in December 2008. The BOE chopped its official bank rate to 0.5 percent in March 2009.

Now U.S. and U.K. policy makers are trying to tamp down investor anticipation of higher borrowing costs, saying increases aren't on the immediate agenda.

Yellen said March 5 the U.S. economy "continues to operate considerably short" of the Fed's goals for inflation and employment. Two days later, Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said market expectations that the central bank will raise its main rate "around the middle of 2015" are "very reasonable."

The BOE also isn't in any rush to remove emergency stimulus that's entering a sixth year because the economy probably will be in "extraordinary times a few years down the road," Carney told lawmakers in the U.K. Parliament on March 11. Weakness from Europe and the higher cost of credit also reinforce the case for limited rate increases. "We need to take all those factors into account so that we are setting policy that's consistent with an economy operating at it potential."

Supporting his position are BOE data on the spreads between the central-bank rate and market interest rates. The average premium on a two-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 75 percent loan-to-value ratio was 1.87 percentage points above the benchmark in February, up from 0.32 percentage point in July 2007. Company credit spreads were about 1.9 percentage points higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter of 2007.

Because of the widening, "it would be very surprising if rates were to go back to where they were pre-crisis," said Mike Amey, a London-based money manager at Pacific Investment Management Co.

Such an environment may restrain the yield on government securities. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasuries will rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this year from 2.67 percent at 12:35 a.m. London time, based on the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That's below the 4.32 percent average for the five years ending 2008.

Ten-year U.K. gilt yields will be above 3.5 percent when the BOE stops raising its benchmark, according to 86 percent of 100 investors in a Royal Bank of Scotland Group survey. The yield averaged 4.78 percent in the decade ending December 2008.

Most respondents in the RBS poll, released this month, said the BOE benchmark will reach the neutral rate in 2017, with almost half predicting it will be between 2 percent and 2.99 percent.

For equity investors, weaker-than-traditional monetary policy may represent a buying opportunity, even when interest rates do begin to rise, said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank AG in London. U.S and some emerging-market stocks could be bolstered, while prices of assets such as commercial and industrial property will increase, he said.

Central banks are making "a big bet that there's a lot of slack in the economy and that they can continue to run interest rates below their natural level," said Sarah Hewin, head of research at Standard Chartered Bank in London. "If you get that wrong, you very quickly start to generate inflation, but central banks are always more concerned about the risk of deflation than the risk of inflation."

Low borrowing costs also may spark asset bubbles. The average for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.K. was 2.37 percent in February compared with 5.74 percent in February 2008, BOE data show. That helped push home prices up 5.5 percent in December from a year earlier to a record 250,000 pounds ($415,200), while London values surged 12.3 percent to an all- time high of 450,000 pounds, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.

As rates stay low, the BOE is relying on so-called macroprudential tools to fine-tune prices, including ending support for home loans under the Funding for Lending Scheme this year.

"One of the problems with the low interest-rate policy is that central banks are washing their hands of the consequences of any asset-price booms," Commerzbank's Dixon said. This could stoke up a bubble in the next couple of years that "might pop quite badly later on."

Yellen countered such concerns in response to a question during testimony before the House Financial Services Committee.

The Fed is "highly focused on trying to identify those threats," she said Feb. 11. "The stock market broadly has increased in value very substantially over the last year, and our ability to detect bubbles is not perfect, but looking at a range of traditional valuation measures doesn't suggest that asset prices broadly speaking are in bubble territory."

At the end of their Jan. 28-29 meeting, U.S. policy makers left unchanged their statement that they probably will hold their benchmark rate near zero "well past the time" unemployment falls below 6.5 percent, "especially if projected inflation" remains under their longer-run goal of 2 percent. They have said they can use other tools to control price acceleration, such as the ability to pay interest on the cash financial institutions park at the central bank.

The jobless rate was 6.7 percent in February, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was at 1.2 percent in January. With unemployment forecast to go below 6.5 percent this year, Yellen may announce guidance that's less specific as soon as this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.

Carney made such a shift after Britain's jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent in the three months through November-just above the 7 percent his Monetary Policy Committee had identified as the level for a possible rate increase. In February, the BOE issued a revised plan that includes a range of indicators including measures of involuntary part-time employment and long- term joblessness, and a renewed emphasis on communications with households and businesses.

"We still don't know how much potential output was destroyed during the crisis," said Joachim Fels, chief international economist at Morgan Stanley in London. "Potential output growth has come down."

In Britain, GDP was 1.4 percent smaller in the fourth quarter than at the peak in early 2008, supporting the BOE's view that there's enough spare capacity to keep rates low without fueling price acceleration.

When the central bank does begin raising its benchmark, "it will probably do so only gradually and to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of 5 percent for some while," BOE policymaker Charles Bean said in a speech last week at the North East Chamber of Commerce in Darlington, northern England.

"I have something like a 2 percent to 3 percent range in mind here," he said. "Even if we start to withdraw some of the exceptional monetary stimulus in the not-too-distant future, you should not expect bank rate to shoot straight back up to pre- crisis levels."###485||Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.

What: Shares of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) slumped nearly 13% Friday after the company announced the termination of CEO Steve Bennett.

So what: Bennett will be temporarily replaced by board member Michael Brown as Symantec searches for a permanent CEO. The move also follows yet another painful quarter in which Symantec saw revenue fall 5% year over year amid sluggish PC sales and a drastic sales force restructuring. Bennett insisted at the time, "While we won't be happy until total business activity is growing again, I'm happy with our financial results given the massive changes in our business."

Bennett served in his post for roughly a year-and-a-half after replacing Symantec's then-CEO of three years, Enrique Salem.

Now what: Though board chairman Daniel Schulman recognized Bennett's actions as "establishing a solid foundation for Symantec's future," he stated, "Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

So what's an investor to do? Even with shares down 23% year to date, I'm sticking by my previous stance of patiently watching from the sidelines. Symantec shares may look cheap trading below 10 times next year's expected earnings, but I have little interest diving into the stock of a faltering business until we receive more clarity on its future direction.###486||Empty###487||Why did this happen?

“We recognise Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement.

“These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.”

The company also confirmed a special committee of the board will immediately commence the search for a new permanent CEO, as well as republishing its fiscal outlook previously published on January 29. Symantec’s revenue will be of $1.615 to $1.655bn, compared to $1.748bn a year ago.

Yet the CEO shuffle is grabbing the headlines. Schulman added: “Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

In other words, rearrange the following – man dead walking – and you’ve pretty much got it.

Bennett’s tenure at Symantec may be seen more sympathetically with the benefit of hindsight given his remit was to slim down and transform the company, having said when he took the helm: “I believe our assets are better than our performance and I need to understand what’s in the way.”

The company married up its MDM and MAM offerings at the Symantec Vision convention in Las Vegas back in April, with the suite also offering mobile mail client, single sign on for MAM and MAM connection security, proving the value of enterprise mobility in its portfolio.

Whoever takes over the reins at Symantec will perhaps want to go better than emulating Bennett, or the previous CEO Enrique Salem, who left in July 2012, but John W. Thompson, chief exec from 1999 and 2009 and now chairman of the board of directors at Microsoft.

This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser###490||TORONTO — Courts in four provinces have given the thumbs up to a Canada-wide settlement with Toyota relating to consumer claims for alleged economic loss as a result of unintended acceleration involving certain Toyota vehicles.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said Monday that the settlement for economic loss following certain recalls in 2009 and 2010 does not impact ongoing litigation for personal injury or wrongful death claims related to alleged unintended acceleration.

"It's a relief to know that Toyota is offering substantial benefits to a very large number of Canadian consumers in order to resolve these actions. I think that this is a fair settlement for Toyota owners across the country," said Steven Hamilton, the representative plaintiff for members of the Ontario class.

The settlement — approved by courts in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan — provides class members with a customer support program for a minimum of three years and up to 10 years to cover all parts and labour costs for certain vehicle components.###491||The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. today and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company.

The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. today and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.



Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.



The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker's disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.



"Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues ... Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress," Holder told a news conference.



Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, "we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust," said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. "In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first."



Toyota said it had "made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."



Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totaling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.



The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.###492||Euro hits session lows against dollar and yen

Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh session lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, following reports that armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol.

hit session lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.24% to 1.3888.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3850 and resistance at 1.3941, the session high.

The euro extended losses after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The euro slipped against the dollar earlier Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

The euro fell to session lows against the yen, with down 0.56% to 140.85.

Elsewhere, the dollar was trading close to session lows against the yen, with down 0.32% to 101.42, holding above last Friday’s trough of 101.19.###493||'Bankrupt' exchange Mt. Gox finds 200,000 'lost' bitcoins in old wallet

Washington, Sat, 22 Mar 2014 ANI

Washington, March 22 (ANI): The bankrupt Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has reportedly said that the company has found nearly a quarter of the bitcoins, previously thought to be lost or stolen, in its disused electronic wallet.

The company located 200,000 bitcoins worth around 485 million dollars in one of its old wallets.

According to the Verge, Mt. Gox said that it now holds approximately 202,000 bitcoins, with 650,000 still missing, warning that the figure missing was still subjected to change along with the suspected reasons for their disappearance.

Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO, wrote in a statement that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared were still under investigation.

Earlier, the firm had filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month, claiming hack attack that led to theft of about 7,50,000 customer bitcoins and 1,00,000 of the firm's own bitcoins.

"What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication," said Merkel's spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz. "It doesn't fit with our idea of freedom of expression to forbid or block any form of communication."

Turkey's courts blocked access to Twitter following Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's vow, on the campaign trail ahead of March 30 local elections, to "wipe out" the service. He says he does not care what the international community says about it, though President Abdullah Gul has objected to his actions.###497||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this. In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance. If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###498||Harriet Green

Bruno Guillon, the chief executive of fashion house Mulberry, has resigned “with immediate effect”.

The store, which issued a profit warning in January, seeing shares plummet 25 per cent, will now be looking for a new leader.

Godfrey Davis, who is a current non-executive chairman and has previously been chief executive, will hold the reins until a successor is found.

Davis thanked Guillon, who’s been at the helm for two years, for his work.

He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

Shares of eBay (EBAY) are up 35 cents, or 0.6%, at $57.77, as the company's war of words with activist investor Carl Icahn continues.

This afternoon, Icahn tweeted to followers that he had released a new letter criticizing the company's management, accusing them of withholding critical documents he has requested pertaining to the company's sale of Skype, which he has said demonstrated conflict of interest on the part of the board of directors when the transaction was done:

While the board and its advisors may try to use tricks and technicalities to keep documentary evidence of malfeasance out of the hands of stockholders, I believe that ultimately truth will win out. It may not be in time for this year's annual meeting and it may even take years, but I believe that we will ultimately be successful in forcing eBay to come clean with its stockholders and disclose publicly all documents relating to the Skype affair, only some of the sordid details of which we recently exposed. And when that day comes, I believe that eBay, CEO John Donahoe, director Marc Andreessen and Chairman and founder Pierre Omidyar will be forced to recant their statements that my claims were "false and misleading."

Icahn, you'll recall, has urged eBay to spin out its PayPal payments unit. As the company resisted, Icahn moved on to questioning the judgement of CEO John Donahoe and members of the board, using the Skype transaction as evidence of bad faith and lack of concern for shareholders.

Today's missive follows an article yesterday by re/code's Jason Del Rey in which he quotes a statement from eBay saying Icahn is not legally entitled to documents he has requested.

Update: eBay has responded in an email statement:

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Oracle (ORCL) shares rose after the software, services and cloud computing giant reported third-quarter results that missed results.

For the third quarter, Oracle earned 68 cents a share on $9.3 billion, coming in below what analysts were expecting. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting 70 cents a share on $9.36 billion. The company did note in its press release that currency fluctuations impacted earnings by 3 cents a share, with 2 cents coming from the wild swings in Venezuela.

"In constant currency, our Cloud Software Subscriptions revenues grew 25% and our Engineered Systems revenue grew more than 30% in the quarter," said Oracle President and CFO Safra Catz in the press release. "Oracle Cloud Applications and Engineered Systems are both rapidly growing, billion dollar run-rate businesses. Those two high-growth businesses helped us deliver record year-to-date operating cash flow, and a record $15 billion of operating cash flow over the past twelve months."

Shares were higher in Wednesday trading, having reversed course from earlier in the session, gaining 0.12% to $38.91.



WATCH: Oracle Presents Trading Opportunity on Earnings Dip

CEO Larry Ellison lauded the company's hardware portfolio, noting Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters had over a 30% constant currency growth rate during the quarter. "Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have to."

During the company's conference call, Oracle said it expects revenue to rise between 3% and 7% during the quarter, with earnings per share expected to be between 92 cents and 99 cents. Analysts are expecting 96 cents.

Following the results and the call, analysts were largely positive on the name, noting that the cloud portfolio seems to be turning around, as the company heads into its seasonally strong fourth quarter. Here's what a few analysts had to say.

UBS analyst Brent Thill (Buy, $42 PT)

"ORCL is still searching for a breakout after 10 straight Qs of sub 5% rev growth. ORCL's three main businesses (database, apps and middleware) have been pressured by agile competitors and ORCL's late transition to the cloud, which is now well underway and is masking some of the reported growth. Now that some of these issues are being addressed more proactively by ORCL, we should start to see top line growth reaccelerate, especially as we enter ORCL's seasonally strong FQ4. $42PT."

JPMorgan analyst John DiFucci (Overweight)

"ORCL reported F3Q results that were about in line with estimates, with hardware products slightly better than expectations and software license & cloud a bit shy. We continue to believe that while ORCL is seeing secular pressure in its applications business, concerns about its most important (and most profitable) business, infrastructure software, are overblown."

Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis (Buy, $43 PT)

"For now, we will continue with our BUY rating on Oracle because the stock is sufficiently inexpensive to serve as ballast in your typical software portfolio, full of high flier money losers which can face random and rapid loss of faith by investors. That said, incrementally at least, we inched closer to a downgrade to Hold on ORCL, particularly if it appears that the firm will continue to report low end of the range results against truly easy comparisons. For now, Oracle remains a tepid BUY."

Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead (Buy, $45 PT)

"ORCL's F3Q14 numbers came in slightly below estimates, with total revs of $9.3b (+4% y/y, +6% in c/c, +4% c/c excluding acquisitions) vs. estimates of $9.36b and software license and subscription revs of $2.4b (+4% y/y, +6% in c/c) lower than expectations of $2.47b, offset by solid hardware revenues of $725m (+10% c/c and above expectations). However, the results were in-line with guidance and the mid-point of the F4Q14 revs growth guidance (of 5%) was in-line with estimates. Geographically, license sales in the Americas were up a solid 9% while Asia-Pac was down 3%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 was lower than estimates of $0.70, but was $0.71 making all FX adjustments."

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan (Buy, $44 PT)

"Cloud bookings on a 12 month basis grew 60%+ (Fusion apps grew triple digits), and 30%+ organic, including 65 seven or eight figure deals. Organic CC software revenues grew 2%+ y/y. Engineered systems grew 30%+ y/y and organic hardware revenues grew +3% CC y/y. Hardware has turned the corner and is finally growing on an organic basis, which should help accelerate the topline. Middleware grew double digits. Renewal rates hit a 4-year high. We previously noted that the 12c database product cycle is coming up (see details on pg 4). Tech license growth rates have not benefitted yet from the introduction of 12c, which should be an incrementally positive driver going forward."

Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan (Hold, $37 PT)

"ORCL's F3Q14 results were largely in line with expectations, with some puts ($0.02 currency devaluation impact) and takes (continued strong HW, lower than expected tax rate). While Cloud bookings improvement is positive, we still don't see anything in results/guidance that argues strongly for a change in our view at this point. We maintain our Hold."

MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez (Buy, $41 PT)

"We reiterate our Buy rating and $41 12-month price target following 3Q results. While software sales were a little light, we believe investors are likely to look past the quarter given accelerating cloud applications momentum, an improving hardware business and a solidly in-line 4Q outlook. We are buyers on any weakness this morning into seasonally strong 4Q and a multiyear 12c database cycle in front of us."

Regulatory changes are aiming to make reverse mortgages safer, writes the Wall Street Journal in a report this week, cautioning that the loans are still not for everyone.

The changes are working to ensure borrowers can uphold their loan obligations and make it “harder for borrowers to dig themselves into a hole,” the WSJ writes.

“Used wisely, reverse mortgages enable older adults to tap the value of their homes without having to uproot themselves and sell,” the report states. “But experts warn retirees to tread carefully with these complicated loans. Used improperly, a reverse mortgage can leave a retiree broke and without a roof over his head.”

The WSJ spoke with elder law expert Bernard Krooks of Littman Krooks LLP who noted that reverse mortgages are more complicated than other types of loans, particularly forward mortgages.

AARP policy advisor Lori Trawinski also weight in noting that like any loan, a reverse mortgage comes with obligations that must be met.

“The important thing about these mortgages that people really need to remember is that they are loans, and as with any loans they come with a set of obligations,” Trawinski told the WSJ.

The decision to take a reverse mortgage should consider input from advisers, accountants and estate-planning attorneys, WSJ says, including an overall outlook on the borrower’s financial situation.

“While it can be a useful part of estate planning, it’s not for everyone,” Krooks said. “It shouldn’t be done without being looked at in terms of overall financial needs.”

What is interesting is that this was not baked into the cake because the rally was up 3.2% at $32.99 on Thursday.

News wires that were given access to the Federal Reserve data showed that Zions Bancorp fell short on the minimum capital levels. At the low point of a theoretical recession, Zion’s Tier 1 common ratio would be only 3.5%. The Fed wanted to see 5% as a base under that scenario.

Keep in mind that under the severe recession guidelines, it is a scenario where unemployment hits 11.25% and where GDP would be down 5%. Another focal point was for housing prices to be down by 25%.

Zions has a yield of 0.5% with a $0.04 per quarter dividend for its common stock. Even when you consider that this was raised from only $0.01 per share per quarter in 2013, this 0.5% yield is just too low to attract many investors.

Zions will reportedly resubmits its capital plans to the Federal Reserve in April. Zions was trading down 1.5% at $32.50 in the after-hours, against a 52-week range of $23.10 to $33.33.###505||Empty###506||Empty###507||Putting up rooms on Airbnb could be a $10 billion idea.

The current cap is an average of $0.24 per transaction. The Houston Chronicle said that retail merchants had deemed the cap too high.

The ruling, which was issued by the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on Friday, reversed a lower court decision which was in favor of the retail groups. The retail groups reportedly sued the Fed for setting the cap, which is actually a US Congress mandate stemming from a financial regulatory overhaul in 2010. Before the overhaul, the transaction was initially set at an average of $0.44 per debit card swipe. The Chronicle noted that the Fed proposed a $0.12 transaction fee. When the transaction fee doubled when it was passed and implemented, the retail groups claimed that the federal agency had buckled under the pressure from bank lobbyists. The plaintiffs have argued that the Fed factored banks' expenses into the cap that the law had not allowed, which was a clear deviation to the intention of the 2010 overhaul.

The Chronicle said banks had been lobbying to increase the original proposed cap of the Fed and explained that the federal agency overlooked the cost of handling the debit card transactions, maintenance and fraud prevention. In late 2011, there were attempts on banks to recoup the said costs by charging their debit card customers monthly fees. Public uproar over the monthly fees led for the said banks to drop the charges, The Chronicle said.

In a statement, plaintiff the National Retail Federation said following the Appeals decision that it will be reviewing the court ruling and will mull over its decision on whether to appeal it. Senior vice president and general counsel Mallory Duncan said on behalf of the group, "NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress. The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks."###512||Russian President Vladimir Putin has hit back at Western powers by claiming he'll protect Bank Rossiya and keep his salary in group despite the slew of strict US sanctions over his inner circle and his country.

Sanctions against 20 Russian officials and "cronies who held significant resources" have targeted President Vladimir Putin's inner circle and a bank as the US turns up the heat in protest at Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea.

Wal-Mart will begin accepting video game software (not hardware) trade-ins on March 26. The company plans to pay an average of $35 per title, though trade prices will of course vary on a game-by-game basis.

According to Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia, GameStop investors need not be worried about Wal-Mart's entrance into the market. Bhatia points out that Best Buy, Target, and Amazon have all tried to enter the used game market and none have had much success.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well. However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying 1 disc at a time from customers," Bhatia said.

GameStop's competitive advantages, according to Bhatia, include 1) owning and operating its own massive refurbishment center in Texas; 2) having pricing algorithms and experience developed over the past 10 years; 3) running its own Power-Up Reward membership program. Overall, Sterne Agee continues to rating GameStop as a "BUY."

Wal-Mart will not offer any kind of membership for its used game program, at least not at launch, executives for the company said yesterday during a conference call.###516||By Sneha Shankar - Mt. Gox found 200,000 forgotten bitcoins, a week after the online currency exchange filed for bankruptcy claiming that all its bitcoins had been stolen, the company said in a statement Thursday.

Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that the bitcoins were found in an old electronic wallet that the company had previously believed was empty and was last used in June 2011. Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, stating that it had lost all of its 850,000 bitcoins, said that it moved the newly-found bitcoins into offline wallets due to “security reasons.” The discovery of the bitcoins was made known to the courts, lawyers and other authorities, the company said.

“Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC (balance of bitcoins), the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC,” Mt. Gox said in the statement.

When the company filed for bankruptcy, it had said that, due to a technical issue, its customers were able to make fraudulent withdrawals on the exchange. While Mt. Gox claimed it had fallen victim to a technical problem due to which one of the largest exchanges of the digital currency had to declare bankruptcy, others had speculated about the possibility of fraud on the exchange’s part.

On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago, supervising a lawsuit against Mt. Gox, revised a previous order and allowed some of the exchange's bitcoin movements to be tracked.

"Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it "found" these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins," Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters.

Jonathan Waller, an investor who develops bitcoin-related projects said, according to Financial Times: “It’s good they’ve found some of the Bitcoins but I think it was a badly run system which lost control of their Bitcoins."

Earlier in March, the Japanese government had struggled to explain how the world’s largest bitcoin exchange lost about nearly a billion units of the digital currency. A London-based firm, Selachii LLP, also filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, raising further doubts about the exchange's claims of a hack.

Last week, Karpeles’ Reddit account and his personal blog were breached and the hackers claimed that they found some discrepancies in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins that Mt. Gox claimed was stolen.

The hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox’s accounts while the exchange reported that 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its clients and 100,000 bitcoins of its own had been lost in the hack.###517||Predicting interest rates is not easy, unless you are an analyst. If you are looking at taking a home loan, understanding the movements of interest rates is even more critical, since you would want to decide whether to take the loan at fixed rate of interest or floating. Hybrid home loan takes away this problem. Opting for a pure fixed or a pure floating loan lands you in a situation of losing out on the benefits of the other loan. Here, hybrid loans enable you to enjoy the best of both worlds. (Also read: Home loan checklist)

What are hybrid loans?

With competition increasing with each passing day, banks and financing agencies tend to innovate products that suit and attract you. Hybrid loans are loan options where you get a mix of fixed and floating types of loans, combined into one. It is a contrast to what already existed-the fixed and floating interest rate loans. In other words, hybrid loans are combination loans, which are partly fixed and partly floating. Such loans are preferable since you do not have an idea about the future of interest rates.

Is it suitable for you?

Under this scheme, banks offer you a fixed interest rate for a certain period of time like 3-5 years, while the rest of the outstanding amount would carry a floating rate of interest. Such loans are beneficial for those who cannot afford volatility in expenses in initial few years of your financial life or careers and anticipate an increase in your ability to manage volatility before the loan begins adjusting. Such loans are typically suited to those who have a shorter credit history and a smaller power to face volatility. After the third year, you will be charged slightly higher floating interest rates. However, if you get a fixed rate loan in the beginning, you would be able to manage your financial life better. Keeping interests rates low and fixed initially will help you save more for your future and changing interest rates will help you save thereafter.

The process

When you opt for such loans, your bank might ask you to sign two separate loan agreements-one for fixed rate of interest and the other for floating rate of interest. However, many banks may combine the same and use a single agreement for both the components. You must read the terms and conditions of your agreements with utmost care and your relationship manager is bound to explain to you, if you do not understand them.

Under Hybrid loans, many banks offer you the option of foreclosing the floating component if the interest rates move up, with or without any pre-payment fees. And if the interest rates move down, may foreclose the fixed part, with or without pre-payment penalty, as per banks policies. Other banks offer you facilities such as converting your fixed portion to floating if the interest rates move down and converting the floating rates into fixed, if interest rates move up. Of course you will be charged a certain amount of fees for doing so, which can more often than not, be negotiated.

Some examples of hybrid loans include State Bank of India's offer of SBI-Flexi Home Loans, HDFC's 2-in-1 Home, Part Fixed,-Part Floating loan by ICICI and Bank of Baroda's Flexi-home loans.

For example, if you opt for a loan of Rs 20 lakh and are not sure about the movement of interest rates, you have the option of choosing to take 60 percent of Rs 20 lakh as a fixed rate home loan and remaining Rs 8 lakh at a floating rate of interest. Choosing this proportion is open to you and is based on how much risk you can afford to take and depends on your understanding of the interest rate market.

Your risk appetite would be high if you go for a higher floating component in a scenario where interest rates are likely to go upwards and vice versa.

Opting for hybrid loans is a good idea for those who keep a track of changing interest rates regularly. Otherwise, they just might be more than tricky for you. Because the initial teaser rates may be loan enough to beat competition, if you do not pay in time and keep a track of movement of interest rates, your EMI or equated monthly instalment may just shot up later. These problems blow up to a large extent in times of weak economy. Individuals who expect raises and promotions to factor in the higher EMIs they would have to pay in future have tough time when hopes do not realize.

Things to note

The two very important factors that you need to consider while analyzing floating rates would be the margin and the cap that would be applicable to you. If both these numbers are fairly low, there is nothing like going out and opting for a hybrid loan now, if the fixed rate suits your current repayment ability.

Moving swiftly after Crimeans voted in a referendum to join Russia, President Vladimir Putin said: “Our Western partners, led by the US, prefer to practice their politics guided not by international law, but the law of the strong. They have come to believe that they are exceptionally qualified and empowered to resolve the fates of the world. They bring power to bear against sovereign states and build coalitions based on the principle ‘whoever’s not with us is against us.’”

An annexation treaty Putin signed with pro-Russian Crimean leaders says the autonomous territory will be fully integrated into Russia after a transition period.

Kyiv, Brussels and Washington twitched.

At least, that’s how jubilant Muscovites and their politicians interpreted Western expressions of outrage over the move and a first phase of sanctions. The powerful in Moscow scoffed at the measures.

In contrast, in the biggest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, US President Barack Obama sought to present his Russian counterpart’s move as motivated by impotence at home — troops in Crimea or not.

Obama said: “The truth is that Mr. Putin acted out of weakness, not out of strength. We are not going to be getting into a military excursion in Ukraine. What we are going to do is mobilise all of our diplomatic resources to make sure that we’ve got a strong international coalition that sends a clear message, which is that Ukrainians should decide their own destiny.”

Russia accuses the new pro-Western authorities in Kiev of endangering Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. It says it will insist that its compatriots’ rights and freedoms be fully respected.

Warning of the risks that could come with a weak response to Moscow’s absorption of Crimea, Washington foreign policy pundits Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft have been analysing Putin’s justification of his moves against Ukraine. Both Americans are former US National Security Advisors.

At a conference at the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank in Washington, DC, they said a surprisingly efficient annexation of Crimea ends a quarter of a century of constructive relations between Russia and the United States.

According to Brzezinski: “We have to convey to the Russians our concern that those words spoken by Putin are terribly reminiscent of what Hitler was saying about Austria before the Anschluss [the occupation and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938], which was then followed by the Sudetenland [areas of other countries inhabited mostly by German speakers], and we know the rest of the history. And that could be very serious in Europe. Either we can be passive in the face of a calamitous explosion or maybe the Ukrainians will fall apart and simply there will be a repetition of what happened in Crimea.”

In Scowcroft’s opinion: “Putin is a different person, a very different person from Gorbatchev or even from Khrushchev, and he has the outlook of someone who was KGB and who saw the Soviet Union collapse. He is a person full of venom, because he thought that that collapse was taken advantage of by the West, especially by the United States, to humiliate Russia or take advantage of Russia.”

Neither Scowcroft nor Brzezinski see Europe’s new insecurity as a return to the Cold War; they see it in a different context of 21st century reality.

Brzezinski: “Putin has to consider: can he really undertake a war at this stage in the heart Europe given the state of his economy, which is really very bad, and the relatively retarded state of his military, which is only now being modernised? If he did this ten years from now, he might be in much better shape. But right now, I don’t think a serious conflict in that part of Europe is something that Putin would welcome. He would like to have a quickie: either the break-up of Ukraine or some upheaval within Ukraine. And I think we have to reassure him in a constructive fashion that that is somewhat unlikely, because we have interests too.”

Scowcroft said Putin’s action could have been averted if the West had paid attention to Urkaine’s economy, but, he said, both the US and Europe have been lazy about the whole thing.

Scowcroft: “The EU made an offer for a relationship with Ukraine. It didn’t amount to anything. Putin turns around and offers a 15 billion dollar loan. What the United States could have done at that time and I think should have done is to say, look, Ukraine’s economy is in terrible shape, let’s us, the United States, the EU and Russia put together a programme of assistance to Ukraine.”

Our correspondent Stefan Grobe asked Brzezinski if the initial sanctions taken against Russia are enough.

Brzezinski answered: “Well, they [the sanctions] are like the introductory phase of a dinner, just a little bit of a preliminary bite, but not too much bite.

Grobe: “Do you expect more?”

Brzezinski: “Yes.”

Grobe concludes: “The foreign policy establishment in Washington is deeply troubled by Putin’s action and by the Western response. The hope is that President Obama and the European allies at the EU summit in Europe next week will find a more muscular approach.”###520||Empty###521||by Thom Forbes , Featured Columnist @tforbes, March 18, 2014

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###522||Investors can expect a positive start for the stock market today: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) gained 61 points in pre-market trading. World indexes didn't budge much overnight, with European shares lower by 0.20% as of 7:30 a.m EST.

The Federal Reserve today kicks off its two-day rate-setting meeting, after which Chairwoman Janet Yellen is expected to announce that the central bank will continue to carefully scale back its stimulus measures. Yellen is also scheduled tomorrow afternoon give her first press conference since taking up the leadership position of the Fed.

Meanwhile, news is breaking this morning on several stocks that could see heavy trading in today's session, including GameStop (NYSE:GME), Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), and DSW (NYSE:DSW).

GameStop has a brand new threat on its hands. The video game retailer's stock was down 4.4% in pre-market trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is jumping into the used video game business. Wal-Mart will soon begin paying customers for pre-owned games and allowing them to apply that cash toward new game purchases, or for any other items within its stores. Despite a successful push into other business categories over the last few years, used game profits remain key to GameStop's bottom line, accounting for almost 25% of earnings. Still, the company has fended off many other challenges to that lucrative business.

Hertz shares are up 0.6% in pre-market trading after the car rental company reported fourth-quarter earnings results and announced plans to break its equipment rental business off into a separate company. Hertz plans to perform the split as a tax free spinoff to shareholders, with much of the $2.5 billion in proceeds set to fund a huge stock buyback of up to 20% of the company's outstanding shares. Separately, Hertz booked a slightly disappointing 10% increase in fourth-quarter sales to $2.6 billion, which resulted in a 20% dip in profit to $0.26 a share.

Finally, DSW said this morning that revenue improved by a slim 3.8% in its fiscal fourth quarter as comparable-store sales growth was flat. The shoe retailer's adjusted profit also fell to $0.31 a share from last year's $0.35 a share. Still, DSW management seems confident in the company's future: The company hiked its dividend by 50% and boosted its outlook for store potential to 525 locations, about 30% greater than its current store footprint. DSW's stock is unchanged in pre-market trading.###523||Empty###524||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###525||Next week, you'll be able to take your old games to Walmart and trade them in. You'll get credit for them—good for buying socks, giant liters of soda or cat food—but you won't be getting cash.

3,100 stores across the U.S. will be kicking off the new trade-in program, Walmart announced in a conference call today. Exec Duncan Mac Naughton said that the focus is "is to pay more games and sell them for less." Representatives said that the range of trade-in value changes with game age—just like at Gamestop and other retail outlets— but anticipate that $35 will be most common price point.

In a Q&A session after the announcement, the topic of giving cash back for games came up. Mac Naughton said that "[customers] would get a credit at Walmart which I would argue is just like cash." The program comes on the heels of a smartphone and tablet trade-in program and will be also handled by CExchange, which implements similar programs at Radio Shack.

The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online. Walmart says they want a chunk of the $2 billion pre-owned video game "opportunity" but after-market sales of games is something that tends to rankle the publisher who supply store shelves with new-release titles. When asked in that Q&A session how publishers have reacted to their plans, company reps said "they're excited," followed by a friendly directive for journalists to ask them how the publishers in question felt.

Walmart's a huge retailer with ridiculous reach so—while the EAs and the Microsofts of the world may bristle at the idea of their titles getting resold without getting a cut—it's tough to imagine any kind of real pushback.

Several big biotech names tumbled Friday, some more than 8%, leaving a sea of red for investors. But is the sell-off long term or just a dreary day on Wall Street?

GILD Your browser does not support iframes.

Many thought the selloff was due to Democratic lawmakers coming down on Gilead Sciences Inc. /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD over the pricing of its promising new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which is $84,000 for a 12-week treatment. Shares ended the day off more than 4% to $72.07.

But there also have been mounting worries over froth forming in the biotech sector and a possible correction on the horizon. It probably won’t be known just how meaningful Friday’s selloff was until next week, or beyond. There is one cause for concern, though, as four major biotech exchange-traded funds all lost more than 4% with many hitting historic lows.

One frequently watched gauge among ETFs, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB , dropped nearly 5% when it was all over. It was noted that the fund neared its 100-day moving average by RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.

Yee noted that “sentiment is rolling over in biotech a bit” in a note on one big name in the sector, Celgene Corp. /quotes/zigman/69584/delayed /quotes/nls/celg CELG , which lost nearly 4% to $144.40 at the close. He also noted that even though Celgene won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday for Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug, that stock crashed its 200-day moving average.

“However, we’ll state it again that the fundamentals [on Celgene] haven’t changed,” he said. Yee contends the launch of Otezla should be uneventful.

ISI Group’s Mark Schoenebaum noted data shows the drug isn’t as powerful as competing treatments but has fewer side effects and is cheaper — perhaps a strong suit considering Gilead’s pricing issues. He says although a full-year of Otezla is priced at $22,500, it still is a discount to virtually all other drugs used for the same treatment. And consensus shows it should bring in more than $1 billion in revenue by 2017.

The pallet was spotted by a search plane Saturday, but has not been closely examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.



It was the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to run down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it disappeared over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people on board en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.



Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center, told reporters in Canberra, Australia, that the wooden pallet was spotted by a search aircraft on Saturday, and that it was surrounded by several other objects, including what appeared to be strapping belts of different colors.



A New Zealand P3 Orion military plane was then sent to find it but failed, he said.



"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," Barton said. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.



AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.



"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."



Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of yesterday night.



Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether Flight 370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared. There was no immediate response.



When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, the first thing they found was a wooden pallet. The military first reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but then said six hours later that the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.



In Australia, eight search planes departed from a military base near the southwestern city of Perth on yesterday to scour an area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) away in an extremely isolated part of the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite images, the most recent released by China on Saturday, have showed large objects floating in the area that experts want to check to see whether they came from the jet.



Air and sea searches since Thursday have not produced any results.



John Young, manager of AMSA's emergency response division, said yesterday's search was mainly relying on human eyes.



"Today is really a visual search again, and visual searches take some time. They can be difficult," he said.



Barton said while the weather was not as good at the start of the day, with sea fog and low clouds, it was clearing up later yesterday.



Despite the frustrating lack of answers, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was upbeat.



"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope â€” no more than hope, no more than hope â€” that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft," Abbott told reporters in Papua New Guinea.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had refined the search based on the latest clue from the Chinese satellite showing an object that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet). It said the object's position fell within Saturday's search area but was not sighted.



yesterday's search was been split into two areas within the same proximity, covering 59,000 square kilometers (22,800 square miles). The areas were determined by drift modeling, the AMSA said.



Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein posted a message on his Twitter account yesterday asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.



More than 300 Malaysian cycling enthusiasts rode their bikes to the Kuala Lumpur airport to remember the people aboard the jet. The cyclists decorated the bikes with small Malaysian flags and stickers that read "Pray for MH370."



The latest satellite image is another clue in the baffling search for the plane, which was carrying 153 Chinese passengers.



"China hopes that these data will be helpful for searching and rescuing efforts," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement.



After about a week of confusion, Malaysian authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



The discovery of the initial two objects by a satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to a stretch of the Indian Ocean southwest of Australia.



Two military planes from China have arrived in Perth, and AMSA said they would join the search on Monday. They join Australian, New Zealand and US aircraft. Japanese planes are also expected soon.



Because the search area is a four-hour flight from land, some of the planes can search for only about two hours before they must fly back. Others may be able to stay for up to five hours before heading back to the base.



Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.###531||Empty###532||US says Rossiya is 'personal bank' for more than a dozen Russian government officials and powerful business leaders

Bank Rossiya, the Russian bank best known for its close ties to top Kremlin figures, is to be "frozen out of the dollar", according to US officials, as part of the new wave of sanctions from Washington.

Shortly after Barack Obama signed off the measures on Thursday it emerged that rating agency Standard & Poors had warned on the outlook for the Russian economy amid escalating tensions over Ukraine.

"Heightened geopolitical risk and the prospect of US and EU economic sanctions following Russia's incorporation of Crimea could reduce the flow of potential investment, trigger rising capital outflows, and further weaken Russia's already deteriorating economic performance," S&P analysts said.

The remarks were made in anticipation of EU and US sanctions, but before the announcement of actions from the US Treasury Department, targeting 20 more Russian citizens and the nation's 17th largest bank with US asset freezes.

"This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy. However, Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community," Obama said.

US officials said the St Petersburg lender was "the personal bank" for more than a dozen Russian government officials and powerful business leaders deemed to be members of Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

Those identified as allegedly doing the Russian president's bidding included the bank's billionaire chairman and largest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk. They claim he acts as "personal banker for Putin", noting he has been referred to as one of the Russian president's "cashiers".

Kovalchuk reputedly forged close ties to Vladimir Putin throughout the 1990s, when Russia's president served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg. The two men still have luxury dachas near each another on Komsomolskoye lake, outside the city.

Kovalchuk is part of a dacha cooperative with other members of this upmarket lakeside community, with several other members also major shareholders in Bank Rossiya.

The bank boss, now estimated by Forbes to have a personal fortune of $1.4bn according to Forbes, helped transform the bank from a Communist party-backed enterprise into a fast-growing and, above all, well-connected bank.

As well as leading the boardroom, Kovalchuk is the largest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, owning close to 30%. Outside banking, he also has interests in a number of federal television channels and a mobile network, Tele2.

The bank has assets of about $10bn and, after its 2010 takeover of Gazenergoprombank, almost doubled in size, breaking into the top 20 of Russian lenders.

Its operations are concentrated in the north-west of Russia and around Moscow, where it is active in a wide range of saving and loan operations, with clients in oil, gas and energy. Bank Rossiya controls large insurance groups Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank has been well known for its substantial dealings with Russian gas group Gazprom. Banking analysts at Fitch Ratings have noted in the past that Bank Rossiya relied heavily on a tiny handful of customers for about 60% of its funding, some of whom also act as customers and shareholders of the bank.

According to US Treasury officials Bank Rossiya "is the personal bank for senior officials in the Russian Federation" and Kovalchuk "is also the personal banker for senior officials ... including Putin".

In their report, S&P analysts said: "In our view, there is a material risk that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could extend beyond Crimea and that violence between pro- and anti-Russian protesters could spread to other cities in Eastern Ukraine." The analysts suggested sanctions imposed by EU countries may be tempered as political leaders looked to their economic, trade and energy interests.

Initial market reactions to the Ukraine crisis have suggested investors were quick to discount fears that the dispute would have a major impact on global trade, but the fresh analysis from S&P and a second round of sanctions from Washington may prompt some to revise that view.

One US official in Washington told Reuters: "Sanctions build over time. They are very powerful. And people may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not."###533||HONG KONG: Hong Kong shares fell 0.30 percent on Monday as Crimea's vote to break away from Ukraine and join Russia led to threats of sanctions against Moscow by the West, fuelling geopolitical tensions.

The benchmark Hang Seng Index slipped 65.54 points to 21,473.95 on turnover of HK$55.78 billion (US$7.20 billion).

The referendum Sunday saw Crimeans overwhelmingly vote to become part of Russia, further fuelling tensions in the worst crisis between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

But while people the predominantly Russian-speaking peninsula celebrated, Ukraine's new pro-European leaders and the West branded the poll “illegal”.

The vote was organised after Russian forces seized de facto control of the region and pro-Moscow authorities took power in response to the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovych in February.

US President Barack Obama told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a phone call that it “would never be recognised by the United States and the international community”.

He said the US and its European allies were “prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for its actions”.

Chinese shares rallied 0.96 percent after the government unveiled a plan to encourage more urbanisation.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 19.33 points to 2,023.67 on turnover of 72.0 billion yuan ($11.7 billion).

The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, jumped 2.06 percent, or 22.17 points, to 1,096.36 on turnover of 101.3 billion yuan.

The government said Sunday is will give more than 100 million Chinese vital documents making them officially residents of the country's cities under a broad plan for the urbanisation that is crucial to economic growth.

It said it will also increase public housing as part of the plan as it aims to have about 60 percent of its population living in cities by 2020, compared with 52.6 percent at the end of 2012.

The “national plan for a new model of urbanisation” also calls expanded public transport, according to the blueprint released by the State Council, or cabinet.

Introduced just 30 years ago the coin has been beset by mass counterfeiting, undermining confidence in the currency and forcing the Royal Mint to respond with a new, more elaborate, design to beat the forgers.

In its place will come a 12-sided dual metal coin, described as the ‘most secure’ in the world.

To be introduced from 2017 it will feature the Queen’s head on one side with a public competition set to be staged to determine what artwork adorns the reverse.

Estimates published by the Royal mint suggest as many as 45m £1 coins currently in circulation are forgeries.###541||YEREVAN, March 18. / ARKA /.

15:27 18.03.2014###542||It may not buy you much these days but is the pound in your pocket actually worth anything at all?

With an estimated £45m fake £1 coins in circulation the Royal Mint is set to introduce a new 12-sided version which it says is designed to be the "most secure in the world".

The coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about how easy it is to counterfeit the current 30-year-old design.

The Royal Mint believes 3% of existing £1 coins are fake, and that the move to update the coin will increase "public confidence" in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

So, with all these worthless coins floating around the currency system how do you know if you've got one?

Depending on the quality of the counterfeit coin they may be easy to spot. Indistinct lettering or the wrong typeface on the edge of the coin is the most obvious give away.

The Queen's head and the pattern on the reverse of the coin should both be upright when the coin is turned over.

A fake coin can also be slightly different in colour. The markings on the coin could also be 'soapy' - an industry term to describe blurred and indistinct details.

The Royal Mint has issued guidance on how to spot one of the 3% of coins that could be fake as follows:

The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.

The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.

The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.

Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.

The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.

The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.

The counterfeiting of coins is a criminal offence under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.

Brussels - EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord Thursday on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy. Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People's Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP's Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the eurozone's 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long.

Mt. Gox's former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement in Japanese and English on the company's website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching these wallets that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed.

Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million.

Since then, plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside of the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the bankruptcy court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site from March 14 to March 15.

The latest announcement is likely to add to the questions about Mt. Gox's collapse. Even the company said it was still uncertain about what led up to its failure.

"Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation," the company concluded in its statement dated Thursday.

Bitcoins can be stored online or offline, otherwise known as "hot" and "cold" wallets. A "cold" wallet can be nothing more than writing down a digital key to access one's bitcoin on a scrap of paper for later use, or storing data on a thumb drive.

Thieves can steal bitcoin by accessing it through a computer network, or by taking the physical storage material.

Many Bitcoin supporters have said that the collapse of Mt. Gox is part of the shake-out of the early, less sophisticated Bitcoin companies that have lost ground to newer, more well-oiled businesses.

"I think that it's yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was," said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about Bitcoin.###547||Pandora is about to become more expensive, but barely.

The popular music streaming company announced changes to its Pandora One subscription plan, which allows users to listen to the content without having to deal with advertisements. The price for the subscription has been $3.99 but it will be going up to $4.99. To keep users from getting too upset, the company grandfathered existing active subscribers into the already-set price of $3.99. The incoming subscribers will have to cough up an extra dollar a month when it goes up to $4.99 in May.

In a blog post on the Pandora blog, the company elaborated upon the changes and justified the price increase.

"We've been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month," the Pandora blog post said. "Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015."

The company then touched base on the new policy that will allow existing active users to continue paying the same price, for now, while others will see a small price hike.

"In order to continue to provide an ad-free listening option, we are implementing some changes to the way we price Pandora One, including a modest price increase for new Pandora One subscriptions."

As you may have heard, we'll be getting a new £1 coin which looks like an old threepenny bit, thereby ensuring future observational comedians the opportunity to coo "remember when quid coins were circular eh? What's that all about?"

Why are we getting a new pound? Well, apparently, it'll be the coin that is the hardest in the world to make a forgery of and has been described as a "giant leap into the future". As there are 43 million fake quid coins in circulation, you can understand why the Royal Mint might want to do something about it.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years’ loyal service the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

The new coin will be 'bimetallic' like the £2 coin and will have new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint HQ.

The Royal Mint chief executive, Adam Lawrence, thinks this is an "exciting project" and added: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time. It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK’s currency in the process."

"We’re extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint’s Integrated Secure Identification System (iSis) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

We should see the new quid in 2017. If the Queen isn't on the throne by then, any coins made with her image will be worth a shedload to collectors, so if you see any knocking about or work at the Royal Mint, steal one now. As for the reverse of the coin, the Treasury has promised that there'll be a public competition to decide the design.

The Redwood City, Calif.-based IT hardware and software provider posted earnings of 68 cents a share on revenue of $9.32 billion, but Thomson Reuters analysts expected the enterprise software and computer hardware company to report earnings of 70 cents a share on revenue of $9.36 billion. Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago.

The stock price closed at $38.84, but following the report it was down about 3.3 percent at $37.55. In contrast, customer and competitor Salesforce was up 2.25 percent at $59.63 on the day.

Oracle Co-President Mark Hurd told analysts on a conference call that new software sales and Web-based subscription rose 4 percent from the same period a year ago. Revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.

Cloud App Bookings Up 60 Percent

Cloud app bookings, upon which Oracle is pinning much of its future business, saw healthy growth of more than 60 percent, Hurd said.

"Our quarterly cloud application revenue is now approaching $300 million. All of our strategic cloud application suites, including Fusion Enterprise Resource Planning, Fusion Human Capital Management and Fusion Customer Experience, posted triple-digit revenue growth," Hurd said.

Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud apps, thanks largely to "more feet on the street" after a sales reorganization in 2012 and a year of experience for new sales people.

"We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now," Hurd said. "We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer."

Sales of Oracle's hardware systems -- including commodity servers and storage and the new-gen Exadata analytics machines -- grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first uptick since the software company's $7.4 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in January 2010.

What a Couple of Analysts Said

"From my point of view, it was in line with what we expected, which wasn't rapid growth in terms of top line, but low to moderate," Gartner analyst Charles Eschinger told eWEEK. "Within the larger enterprise spaces, it was pretty consistent with what we're seeing: buyers having interest in [new] technology but perhaps holding back a little bit more than what we saw last year.

"Oracle's core products really didn't drive the growth. The real growth came from the new products: Fusion and their acquired products and then some of the [new 12C] database. That is where we're seeing more growth in terms of the industry overall and what we expected to hear and see from Oracle."

Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research wrote in a media advisory that Oracle "is not able to fully participate in the new-IT spend; its products are still considered to be for the existing IT. Large projects on Oracle are getting scaled down, large deals are taking a lot longer (30% to 50% longer) to close and new-IT players -- Amazon.com, Pivotal and VoltDB -- are putting competitive pressure on Oracle."

Still, Chowdhry wrote, "the IT spend environment is improving, and Oracle is one of the prime beneficiaries of this trend. Oracle marketing solutions are gaining traction as Oracle continues to make smart acquisitions. Oracle, along with Salesforce.com and Adobe, continue to benefit from increased spending on the marketing solutions.

"The industry is big enough and is currently not at the stage where one vendor needs to take market share from the other. Oracle, Salesforce.com and Adobe are all equally doing well with their marketing solutions offering."###557||Share Email 0 Shares

Vermont’s unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average — the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state’s unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers — the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

“The January numbers start the year on a positive note,” Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. “Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth.”

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February’s report is due out in late March.

One of Vermont’s economic challenges is the size of the work force. With the exception of January’s preliminary numbers, the labor force has dipped in recent years after decades of solid growth.

Moody’s Investors Service named the downward trend in job growth as one of Vermont’s primary credit challenges in its October 2013 assessment of the state’s credit rating. The state’s rapidly aging population — a major factor in the overall labor trends — also topped the list of negative credit factors.

The ratings agency’s sister company, Moody’s Analytics, credits the tourism and food processing industries with helping to keep the state’s economy afloat in the short-term.

Seasonally adjusted state data show a 6.8 percent increase in leisure and hospitality jobs since January 2013: the arts, entertainment and recreation sector gained about 600 jobs. Accommodations and food services filled about 800 positions. Food manufacturing is also up.

Durable goods manufacturing led the seasonally adjusted declines in 2013, shedding 6.5 percent, or 1,400 jobs. Construction is also down, by about 2.1 percent, or 300 jobs, since last January.###558||RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

New Jersey's unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in January, according to preliminary data the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released this morning. But the state lost an estimated 3,900 jobs in the process.

The unemployment rate is nearly two points lower than a year ago, the data show. In January 2014, the jobless rate stood at 8.9 percent.

The January rate also is a notch below the revised 7.2 percent rate that New Jersey tallied in December.

But the preliminary data show that the state had 3.9249 million jobs in January. That's just 5,600 more jobs than January of 2013, when the state reported 3.9193 million jobs.

A report from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development out this morning with "benchmarked" revisions to the 2013 data shows that the state gained 18,800 jobs last year, all within the private sector. The public sector shrank by 1,000 jobs last year, the data also show.

That's stronger than earlier estimates. A preliminary report released in January showed New Jersey may have only gained 10,100 jobs last year.

It takes the form of a twelve-sided coin and bears a strong resemblance to the three pence piece, or ‘threepenny bit’, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971.

A public design competition will determine what the reverse, or ‘tails’ side of the coin looks like.

Although the coin is not expected to be introduced until 2017, a prototoype has been produced as a template for what The Royal Mint says will be ‘the most secure circulating coin in the world to date.’

The finished coin will be made of two different coloured metals and contain what The Royal Mint calls an Integrated Secure Identification System.

iSIS has been developed by The Royal Mint’s in-house technology team ‘and involves the application of an existing security technology that has been proven over decades in banknotes,’ says the Mint, which claims that this is a first for coins.

A public consultation will be held over the summer focussing on the impact of the coin before specifications and metal composition are decided on.

The Royal Mint will also work with key stakeholders to understand the impact on industry.

George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer says, ‘After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

‘With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.’###566||Empty###567||Empty###568||RALEIGH — North Carolina’s unemployment rate for January decreased from the month before and from last January, according to the Employment Security Commission.

It's the second time in less than two years that Symantec has fired its CEO. Bennett became president and CEO in July 2012, when Enrique Salem was fired after three years in charge of the company. The Mountain View, California, company behind Norton Antivirus software did not cite a precise reason for Bennett's ouster Thursday.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman said in a press release.

Symantec Corp. shares fell $1.43, or 6.8 percent, to $19.48 in after-hours trading. The stock is trading near 52-week lows and is down about 15 percent over the past year.

Symantec has been going through a reorganization that includes cutting executive and middle-management jobs, splitting its sales force and focusing on the most promising products.

The company backed its outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends this month.

Brown, who is temporarily taking over as CEO, has been on Symantec's board since July 2005. He is the former chairman and CEO of data backup company Quantum Corp.

Bennett, meanwhile, has resigned from Symantec's board. Steve Bennett had replaced CEO Enrique Salem in 2012, and had then launched a strategic review in a bid to turn around the security software company whose stock has languished for years. He'd announced at the time, "I took this job because I believe that our assets are better than our performance."

Bennett is a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp who was also an executive at General Electric Co.

...###573||ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey's attempt to block access to Twitter appeared to backfire today with many tech-savvy users circumventing the ban and suspicions growing that the prime minister was using court orders to suppress corruption allegations against him and his government.

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey's attempt to block access to Twitter appeared to backfire today with many tech-savvy users circumventing the ban and suspicions growing that the prime minister was using court orders to suppress corruption allegations against him and his government.

Turkey's telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to the social media network hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "rip out the roots" of the website. Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Turkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country — to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.

President Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.

"I hope this implementation won't last long," he wrote.

Links to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.

Erdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.

"Prime Minister Erdogan's move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media," said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Andrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain's Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System — or DNS — blocking, which was easy to work around.

He said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google's Domain Name System, which isn't affected by the ban.

Earlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.

Twitter's @policy account tweeted: "We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon."

Earlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or "SMS."

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Other EU officials also voiced concerns.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey's minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders — although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy — not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

"Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet," Elvan said. "We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness."

Technology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.

The original source of the leaked recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news reports that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

"Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis," said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch.

In Berlin, the German government's human rights commissioner, Christoph Straesser, called on Turkey to reverse the decision immediately, saying "limiting freedom of the press and opinion on this scale is unacceptable."

Britain's Foreign Office also expressed concern, saying that social media has a "vital role to play" in modern democracy and helps promote transparency and public debate.###574||Empty###575||Trading video games for groceries might sound like an odd concept, but it's one of the many exchanges you'll soon get to make at Walmart. The mega-retailer is now accepting trade-ins on used games at its stores, allowing you to turn your old copies of "Call of Duty" and "Halo" into gift cards to be used online or at any Walmart or Sam's Club location.

The program, launching Mar. 26, will allow shoppers to trade in games "for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360." Once a game is brought in, Walmart will scan the UPC, check the disk for any damage and provide a trade-in value based on the game's condition.

All used games will be refurbished and sold in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition later this year.

"There are almost a billion video games sitting unused in homes across the United States," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment for Walmart.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," he continued in a blog post.

Walmart's new trade-in initiative will debut at more than 3,100 locations throughout the United States. The retailer has yet to list any specific trade-in values for popular games like "Titanfall" and "Dark Souls II," so we'll have to wait and see how Walmart's prices stack up to those of Best Buy and Gamestop.

This isn't Walmart's first foray into the world of exchanging electronics, as the store accepts trade-ins on smartphones, tablets and MP3 players.

The bike share program’s survival depends on its appeal to tourist and expansion to new neighborhoods. Citi Bike leaders have reached out to officials in the de Blasio administration to that effect, pushing for a lift in the rates charged for the blue bikes’ use.

Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, told the Wall Street Journal that Citi Bike faces “a number of financial and operational challenges,” the details of which she did not specify. “We are working as diligently as we can to help the company resolve them and strengthen the program going forward,” she said before the City Council’s transportation committee in a March 6 meeting.

Among Citi Bike’s recent issues are equipment damage sustained during Superstorm Sandy, software glitches, a frigid 2013-14 winter that hurt ridership and a greater popularity with annual users than daily or hourly ones. Those long-term riders generate less revenue with the $95 per year plus tax that they pay to use the bikes than those who purchase a 24-hour pass, which costs $9.95 plus tax, or a $25-plus-tax seven-day pass.

The bike share program has also had to contend with lawsuits from a number of New York City residential buildings, which aimed to remove stations from in front of Petrosino Square, 99 Bank Street and Cambridge House at 175 West 13th Street. A suit regarding the station in front of the Plaza hotel remains in limbo.

Others in the real estate industry, however, have embraced bike share stations as a building amenity.

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit has being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

But the big question on many people's lips is: What about the supermarket trolleys?

Described as a 'giant leap into the future' the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit' which disappeared in 1971.

Five ways to tell your pound coin is fake

The original pound coin was issued in 1983 to replace the old pound note which was officially withdrawn from circulation in 1988.

Pound for pound: Some cash facts###578||Turkey's courts have blocked access to Twitter days before elections as Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan battles a corruption scandal that has seen social media platforms awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing.The ban came hours after a defiant Erdogan, on the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, vowed to "wipe out" Twitter and said he did not care what the international community had to say about it.Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a corruption scandal he has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content."Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens," it said.San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message."Twitter, mwitter!," Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!""We will wipe out all of these," said Erdogan, who has cast the corruption scandal as part of a smear campaign by his political enemies."The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is," he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.Twitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread outages overnight. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator (TIB) citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.The corruption investigation became public on December 17 when police detained the sons of three cabinet ministers and businessmen close to Erdogan. The three ministers resigned a week later, while others were removed in a cabinet reshuffle.At an extraordinary session on Wednesday, parliament's speaker blocked opposition pleas to have a prosecutor's report with allegations against the former ministers read out.A document purporting to be that report appeared on Twitter last week. It included alleged transcripts of wiretapped phone conversations, pictures from physical surveillance and pictures of official documents accusing the former ministers and two of their sons of involvement with an Iranian businessman in a bribery and smuggling racket.Reuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the document.Turkish Internet users were quick to come up with ways to circumvent the block. The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly moved among the top trending globally.The disruption sparked a virtual uproar, with many comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.There were also calls to take to the street to protest, although some users equally called for calm.Nazli Ilicak, a columnist who used to work for the pro-government Sabah newspaper described the move as "a civil coup" in an interview on broadcaster CNN Turk.The move was only the latest clash between Turkey's ruling party and social media companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter.After a series of popular protests partly fuelled by Twitter last summer, Erdogan slammed the service as "a scourge."Shortly thereafter a government minister asked Twitter to establish an office in Turkey so that it could better communicate requests to take down content or hold the company accountable to Turkish law. Twitter did not respond to the request.Erdogan said two weeks ago that Turkey could also ban Facebook and YouTube, which he says have been abused by his enemies after a stream of audio recordings purportedly revealing corruption in his inner circle emerged online.But a senior official said on Friday there were no immediate plans to do so."The path was taken to block access within the framework of a court decision because of the failure to overcome the problem with the management of Twitter," the official said."At the moment there is no such a decision for Facebook and other social media," he told Reuters.© Thomson Reuters 2014###579||Empty###580||Trading

The outfit turned up 200,000 coins in an old digital wallet that was thought to be empty, said CEO Mark Karpeles in a statement (PDF). 200,000 coins are worth over $100m.

"MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain old format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins," it said in the statement, explaining that the coins were uncovered earlier this month in a file that had not been used since mid 2011.

Karpeles said that the discovery puts 200,000 Bitcoins in Mt Gox's hands, but added that still means 650,000 Bitcoins have been lost or stolen. It is possible that Mt Gox has overestimated its losses.

"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC." Karpeles explained.

"Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of Bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation."

This month the exchange won bankruptcy protection in the US and a stay of any lawsuits against it. This prompted suggestions that the US bankruptcy court was letting the fox guard the hen house.

The line from the firm is that it is not at fault and is the victim of theft or a bug. Now it should probably add that it is a bit forgetful as well.

"At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the Bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete Bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that Bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug," Karpeles said earlier.

"As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of Bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared." µ###585||Russian stock indexes fell sharply on Friday as investors digested the impact of the sanctions on Ukraine.

The rouble-denominated MICEX was down 3 percent while the dollar-denominated RTS index had fallen 3.6 percent.

Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from

ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor’s. They’ve both downgraded the outlook for Russia’s sovereign debt from “stable” to “negative.”

Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister had said that he did not see any immediate impact from sanctions on Russia’s financial sector or creditworthiness.

On Friday, Visa and Mastercard stopped authorising point-of-sale transactions for Bank Rossiya, which is on the list of targeted economic sanctions leaving many cardholders in shops with declined purchases.

The sanctions against Bank Rossiya has raised fears that similar actions could be taken against other Russian banks, echoing US measures against Iran or Syria.###586||Empty###587||Turkey’s lawyers’ association has asked a court to overturn the country’s ban on Twitter.

Turkey blocked access to the social media network overnight, hours after prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the website.

Links to audio recordings and documents implicating Mr Erdogan and other top officials in corruption have been posted on Twitter ahead of crucial local elections on March 30th.

Turkey’s main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation of the ban.

The Twitter shutdown, which Turks began to notice around midnight last night, occurred 10 days before the local elections and came after Mr Erdogan lashed out at the social media site in an election rally in Bursa, a western town, on Thursday, saying he did not care about international reactions if national security was at stake.

“Twitter, mwitter! We will wipe out roots of all,” Mr Erdogan declared in a campaign speech. “They say, ‘Sir, the international community can say this, can say that.’ I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the state of the Republic of Turkey is.”

Mr Erdogan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began in December.

One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of December 17th , when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr Erdogan has repeatedly - and angrily - insisted that the recording was fake.

The prime minister’s office issued a statement before the ban was imposed, underlining what it said was Twitter’s lack of co-operation after four local courts ruled that certain content must be removed. “The presidency of telecommunication made necessary attempts in line with court rulings, however, Twitter officials have remained indifferent to these requests,” said the statement, posted on the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency.

Unless the website co-operated, the agency added, “Technically, there would be no other option than blocking access to Twitter in order to reduce damages of our citizens.”

Social media networks in Turkey have grown more popular since anti-government protests last summer, when traditional media organisations were silenced under intense government pressure and journalists critical of Mr Erdogan were either fired or forced to resign.

Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, said the company was “looking into” the ban, adding, “That’s all we have for the moment.” In Twitter messages, the company urged people to use mobile connections to get back on Twitter.

“This is certainly politically motivated prior to the local elections and the worst kind of political censorship I have seen,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a professor of cyber law at Istanbul’s Bilgi University. “Absence of Twitter from Turkey will be a significant democratic deficit.”

The government adopted further internet restrictions in February, citing the need to protect privacy. Those restrictions, which were sharply criticised by human rights groups in Turkey and abroad, allowed for the swift closure of websites or removal of Internet content by a court order in a matter of hours.

New York Times###588||Empty###589||About 5 million people overall had enrolled in ACA plans as of March 17, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).



Critics have suggested most of them had insurance before, but had to buy new plans because their old ones were not compliant with the new law.



The Obama administration has touted a recent Gallup poll that found the rate of uninsured Americans dropping to 15.2 percent in February—the lowest rate since 2008.



But McKinsey, a leading management consulting firm, polled about 2,100 exchange-eligible Americans in February, and found only 27 percent of people who had picked a plan were previously uninsured. Only 53 percent of them had paid their first premium, compared with 86 percent of the previously insured. With 5 million total enrollments, that would be about 715,500 previously uninsured Americans who had chosen and paid for new insurance.



It's also been hard to get a handle on how many previously uninsured people have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion in the states that chose to offer it.



The House Energy and Commerce Committee has held numerous hearings on the Obamacare implementation. Chairman Fred Upton has been a vocal critic.



"It's bad enough that the administration has repeatedly moved the goalposts and attempted to redefine what success means for the president's health care law. But the fact that they are deliberately avoiding the threshold measurement of how many of the law's new enrollees were previously uninsured begs the question: what was the goal?" the Michigan Republican said in a statement to CNBC.###590||###591||Consumer shares were higher in pre-market trade Tuesday.

Malaysia's acting transport minister said Saturday that ships are heading to the location. One of the objects appears to be about 70 feet long and 40 feet wide, the BBC, Associated Press and Reuters reported.

"Chinese ships have been dispatched to the area," minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters.

It was a Chinese satellite that took the images. According to China's Xinhua News, the image showing the large object was taken on Tuesday (March 18), which means whatever was seen in the water may have sunk below the surface since then or drifted considerably.

The Indian Ocean is more than 3 miles deep in that area.

Flight 370 and the 239 people on board disappeared from radar screens on March 8 about one hour into its scheduled six-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Most of the plane's communications systems were either disabled or switched off around the time it disappeared. But investigators have followed some clues, including radar data, and believe the jet turned west, crossed the Malay Peninsula and then may have headed south over the Indian Ocean.

Earlier satellite images, taken about a week ago, also showed possible debris in the Indian Ocean about 1,500 miles southwest of Perth, Australia.

Those earlier images were the first possible sign of the missing Boeing 777. They led this week to a refocusing of the search. Aircraft and ships from Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and other nations have been crisscrossing the area. The effort is being led by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

So far, nothing has been spotted.

The newer images taken by the Chinese satellite show objects in the water about 75 miles southwest from where the earlier images spotted something, China's Xinhua News says.

Officials have cautioned that the objects seen in the satellite images may not be related to the missing jet. They might be, for instance, cargo containers that have fallen off ships.###593||Empty###594||Investing.com -

Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh session lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, following reports that armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol.

EUR/USD hit session lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.24% to 1.3888.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3850 and resistance at 1.3941, the session high.

The euro extended losses after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The euro slipped against the dollar earlier Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

The euro fell to session lows against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.56% to 140.85.

Elsewhere, the dollar was trading close to session lows against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.32% to 101.42, holding above last Friday's trough of 101.19.###595||On Friday the Salt Lake City-headquartered Zions Bancorporation (ZION) was found to have insufficient reserves to cover themselves in the event of financial catastrophe, failing a stress test administered by the Federal Reserve. Zions will be forced to shore up their reserves, shed their riskiest loans, and resubmit for approval.

These stress tests are designed to prevent another meltdown like the one the occurred in 2008 from ever again happening. The Federal Reserve’s stress tests however, which are conducted on every major and regional lender in the US, have to strike a tricky balance.

On one hand, the Fed can’t fail too many banks at once or get too byzantine with their punishments. They can’t just close the bank outright, leaving thousands of depositors in limbo. They also can’t flunk too many banks at once or they could threaten to jumpstart a panic.

At the same time the Fed cannot be too lenient in their stress tests. If they start rubber-stamping banks to try to avoid freaking out the populace, stress tests become purposeless.

So what happens to Zions after they fail the test? They are given a couple months to fix the problems by getting the riskiest mortgages off their books. They strengthen their reserves. And if they fail again, they can have their credit rating slashed, digging them further down the hole.

This is where Zion finds themselves. And it looks bad – of 30 major banks tested, they were the only ones to fail. But while they have failed the Fed’s stress test, they are getting a second chance. They will be continued to allow to operate even if they continually fail, which will certainly hurt them going forward and could make their situation dire, no matter what the macro conditions are.

Zion operates under the name Zion in Utah and Cal Bank and Trust in California. They have some $55 billion in assets and currently have a market cap of $5.84 billion.

By midday trading on Friday shares of Zions had fallen 4.30 percent to hit $31.57 a share.

Symantec shares dropped almost 13% in early trading Friday after the antivirus and computer security company suddenly fired its CEO late Thursday.

CEO Steve Bennett was terminated by the board as "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," according to a statement by Symantec.

Investors were stunned by the move which FBR analyst Daniel Ives described as "jaw dropping" in a note to clients.

The board is setting up a search process to find a permanent replacement. Michael Brown, a board member who joined the company following Symantec's purchase of Veritas, is being installed as temporary CEO and president. Bennett had described it plan to turnaround the company in January 2013. The board of directors, though, was looking for a faster turnaround, Ives says. The company's forecast for the March quarter was below what Wall Street was looking for.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Shares were down $2.60 to $18.30 in afternoon trading.

"While we believe the company was slowly heading in the right direction," Ives says. "Last night's announcement leaves a major black-eye on Symantec."

The global Internet community rallied to help Twitter users in Turkey circumvent a block on the popular messaging service on Friday, as some experts said Ankara's efforts were backfiring.



After Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "wipe out" Twitter and the site went dark there Thursday, there was no lack of help from activists, Internet companies and others.



"Trying to ban Twitter has backfired," said Philip Howard, who heads the Digital Activism Research Project at the University of Washington.



"It's drawn the world's attention to the country's increasingly tough censorship and surveillance strategy."



Howard told AFP the Turkish move quickly became a "trending topic" on Twitter -- which prompted fresh criticism of the government.



"News of the ban seems to have driven more Turks to try Twitter out for the first time, breaking national records for Twitter use. Tip sheets for getting around the ban spread like wildfire," he said.



Shortly after Twitter connections were broken, the US-based social media giant posted a message reminding users they could get onto the platform through SMS text messaging.



Activists pointed to ways to tweak a computer's Internet settings to access Twitter.



And some firms offered access to their VPN -- a virtual private network which masks the user's information to circumvent the ban.



Around the world, #Turkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were big topics on the social platform.



'Flood' of tweets



Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina sociologist who is Turkish, followed the news in real time and posted a blog on how her compatriots responded.



"People circumvented, one by one, and then in a flood," she wrote.



"By the end of it all, most trending topics worldwide, and of course in Turkey, were about the blocking of Twitter, and of course, opposing it.



"Let alone be deterred, the number of tweets in Turkish and from Turkey were close to record-breaking levels."



Tufekci said Twitter has become so ingrained in daily life in Turkey that it may be impossible to hold back.



"Twitter is not just a protest tool in Turkey... it's an entrenched part of the networked public sphere," she said.



"The only people not on Twitter at the moment are ardent pro-government supporters who do not want to circumvent, and people who may not have the fairly minimal skill required to circumvent."



Some surveys suggest about one in seven Internet users in Turkey uses Twitter.



The ban on Twitter is the latest in a series of moves by Erdogan's government to tighten its control of the Internet, including banning thousands of websites.



The Turkish premier has come under mounting pressure since audio recordings spread across social media that appeared to put him at the heart of a major corruption scandal.



Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a frequent user of social media, led the chorus of calls against the ban. And activists around the world quickly denounced the Ankara government.



"The decision to block Twitter, a leading medium of communication in Turkey, is quite a dramatic step for a government that claims to be democratic," said David Kramer, president of the pro-democracy group Freedom House.



"It is a bold attempt to stop news of government corruption from getting out in the run-up to local elections. The government should immediately reopen Twitter and recognize that free, unhindered space for debate is essential in Turkey, as it is anywhere else."



Ban is 'futile'



Some activists and analysts said the ban was unlikely to succeed.



"While the ban seems futile, what it indicates is an increasingly authoritarian Turkey," said Jillian York at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.



Emily Parker, a New America Foundation fellow who has a new book on digital activism in authoritarian governments, noted that many people are able to use Twitter despite bans in countries such as China.



"Turkey may have an even harder time keeping people off of Twitter," Parker told AFP.



"Twitter is already extremely popular in Turkey, and has millions of users. It is difficult for authorities to take away Internet freedoms that people once enjoyed."###602||investment choice at home and abroad

It's the second time in less than two years that Symantec has fired its CEO. Bennett became president and CEO in July 2012, when Enrique Salem was fired after three years in charge of the company. The Mountain View, California, company behind Norton Antivirus software did not cite a precise reason for Bennett's ouster Thursday.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman said in a press release.

Symantec Corp. shares fell $1.43, or 6.8 percent, to $19.48 in after-hours trading. The stock is trading near 52-week lows and is down about 15 percent over the past year.

Symantec has been going through a reorganization that includes cutting executive and middle-management jobs, splitting its sales force and focusing on the most promising products.

The company backed its outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends this month.

Brown, who is temporarily taking over as CEO, has been on Symantec's board since July 2005. He is the former chairman and CEO of data backup company Quantum Corp.

Bennett, meanwhile, has resigned from Symantec's board. Steve Bennett had replaced CEO Enrique Salem in 2012, and had then launched a strategic review in a bid to turn around the security software company whose stock has languished for years. He'd announced at the time, "I took this job because I believe that our assets are better than our performance."

Bennett is a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp who was also an executive at General Electric Co.

Written with inputs from AP and Reuters###606||Empty###607||With a major corruption scandal threatening his seat at the top of Turkey’s government, and with national elections less than 10 days away, the country’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a statewide ban on Twitter late Thursday night that sent shockwaves through the country.

Telecom regulators were able to restrict user access, as issued by court order, using a simple DNS block: If a user’s IP address is on the block list, they cannot access the website or service in question. Countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have called for worldwide DNS restrictions before.

Before the ban was enforced, Erdoğan vowed to “eradicate” Twitter from the country in an election speech, apparently after the company had reportedly refused to delete incriminating audio of him instructing his son to dispose of large amounts of cash in the midst of a police investigation. News of the Twitter restriction soon rippled across the Internet, and instructions for skirting the DNS block using VPN (virtual private networks) and Google DNS–both of which change your IP address–quickly spread. Similarly, Twitter issued instructions to Turkish users on how to send tweets using SMS:

While Turkey has blocked services like YouTube before, this is the first time the government has used its authority to block a mobilizing platform like Twitter. Criticism of Erdoğan’s move to stifle the voices of Turkish citizens was swift and cutting. “The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly,” tweeted Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission. “Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.” Turkish president Abdullah Gül also chimed in, perhaps indicatively, from his Twitter account: “The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,” he tweeted.

In the hours after the social media restrictions were announced, it was reported that almost 2.5 million tweets were sent from Turkey–amounting to roughly 17,000 tweets per minute–setting a new record for Twitter use in the country.###608||Empty###609||Kate McCann

The Tokyo-based company has not yet explained how the huge amount of bitcoins, currently valued at about $120 million had moved to “old format” wallets. The company said only that the bitcoins were found in an old-format wallet which it thought no longer held any bitcoins. With the discovery, the number of bitcoins missing from the exchange comes down from 850,000 to 650,000.

Following news of the controversy, in U.S., District Judge Gary Feinerman had frozen the assets belonging to Mt. Gox, but later loosened his restraint on March 11 to allow movement of small amounts of the digital crypto-currency.

The records and offline wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings, the company said in a statement posted on its website. It said the bitcoins rediscovered now had been moved to its offline wallets. Though it did not specify the nature of the offline wallets, normally USB sticks and paper documents are used as such.

The statement mentioned further, “For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC which were at first on the 7th moved to online wallets, were moved between the 14th and 15th to offline wallets. These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels.”

When the company filed for bankruptcy protection it said that nearly all of its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, and said the most likely reason was theft. Out of the 850,000 bitcoins, about 750,000 belonged to those who used the exchange.

MOST POPULAR ARTICLES sponsored by BCG ATTORNEY SEARCH Read More###612||Empty###613||The software driving Bitcoin transactions on the Internet has been updated to fix a weakness that contributed to the downfall of Mt. Gox, once one of the biggest exchanges for the digital currency.

Version 0.9.0 of the "Bitcoin Core" software , the Bitcoin infrastructure software previously known as Bitcoin-QT, contains five separate changes designed to make so-called transaction malleability attacks harder to pull off. As Ars explained last month , the attacks work by flooding exchanges with large numbers of malformed transactions that are similar, but not identical, to legitimate transactions that have already been made. Exchanges that trust one or more of the phantom records instead of the entries in the official Bitcoin blockchain can fall out of sync with the rest of the network and must recalculate their fund balances once the mistakes become apparent.

Attacks that abused the weakness caused several exchanges to suspend cash withdrawals. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox never recovered. Three weeks ago, it filed for bankruptcy after claiming to lose $468 million, $412.5 million of which it said belonged to customers.

In version 0.9.0, the transaction malleability weakness has been fixed by tightening transaction rules preventing “mutated transactions” from being relayed or mined. It also contains new functions that report wallet transactions that conflict with each other or that contain incorrect balances for double-spent (or mutated) transactions. It also includes an installation executable that works on 64-bit versions of Windows.

"If you are running an older version, shut it down," Wednesday's release notes stated. "Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version."###614||Empty###615||Putin Pledges Supports For Sanctions-Hit Lender To Energy Sector

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged his support on Friday for Bank Rossiya, a lender hit by U.S. sanctions which mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.

The bank and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is also one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

"Our companies will continue using the services of the bank," a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following the sanctions.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, instructed the Russian central bank to aid Bank Rossiya, if needed.

"And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand it is a medium-sized bank," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday."

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

The Russian central bank said the measures imposed by the United States would have no significant impact on the financial stability of Bank Rossiya.

"If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors," it said in a statement.

St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, the country's 15th largest in terms of assets, is chaired by Kovalchuk, a close adviser to the president. The friendship between the two men dates back to the early 1990s.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

INDIANAPOLIS – Indiana’s unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been since September 2008, but House Minority Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, said officials need to “take a longer look before gushing praise.”

According to the Department of Workforce Development, Indiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points to 6.4 percent in January. That is lower than all neighboring states and 0.2 percentage points below the national average.

“Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today’s unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement Monday. “Indiana’s rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow.”

The Hoosier state added 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector in January, the most in the country. But Indiana also lost 7,100 private sector jobs, leaving the state at a net loss of 2,500 jobs for the month.

“While others may gush about ‘the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,’ I look at the report and find myself wondering many things,” Pelath said.

He noted all but one of the state’s Metropolitan Statistical Areas – and 82 of the 92 counties – actually saw unemployment rise in January.

“These disparities only serve to heighten the concern that many of us have about the so-called ‘job creation’ engine that the governor, his administration, and his super-majorities like to tout so often,” Pelath said.

But Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center, said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the recent administration’s job creation strategies.

He said the Hoosier economy is closely tied to the national economy so these numbers may be result of the general economic upswing throughout the country.

But Conover also said Indiana has a “well-deserved” reputation as a business-friendly state. The legislature recently passed a bill that will give Indiana the lowest corporate tax rate in the country.

That lowering of the business personal property tax was one of the landmark items of the Pence agenda.

“With this legislative session’s accomplishments in cutting the corporate income tax rate, giving counties new tools for reforming the business personal property tax, and offering new opportunities for career education and retraining, we continue to work hard to ensure the future economic prosperity of our state,” Pence said.

The DWD – along with the U.S. Federal Reserve – cited January’s severe winter weather as one of the main reasons for the loss of jobs around the country.

Conover agreed with the assessment and noted that more than 9,000 jobs were lost in the areas of trade, transportation and utilities and construction alone.

But that explanation was not enough for Pelath.

“People can talk about seasonal adjustments all they want, but I continue to be concerned about the raw employment and unemployment numbers,” he said. “Those tell me who has a job and who is able to take care of their family.”

Pence agreed that there is still more work to be done.

“Amidst this good news, we know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy,” he said. “Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve Indiana’s economic climate, to attract more jobs, and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future

BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina currently has an annual production capacity of around 350,000 and makes sport utility vehicles, including the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models.

"The U.S. will stay a market with great potential for us. This is why we are evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity in the U.S.", Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company's annual results press conference.

Investments made at plants in China will allow BMW to raise production capacity there to 400,000 cars, from 300,000 in 2013.

The Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands reiterated it aims to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

"We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions," Reithofer said.

Last week, BMW reported its automotive division's fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

The forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014, and on a steady recovery in European markets, BMW said.

BMW expects significant growth in markets outside of Europe including high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in China.

Analysts welcomed the positive outlook.

"We see BMW's confidence as a major positive trigger for the stock," analysts at ISI Global said in a note on Wednesday.

At 0950 GMT, BMW shares were up 5.1 percent at 84.88 euros.

BMW said it expected sales in the second half of 2014 to be higher than in the first six months as a result of a large number of model launches, including of the compact 2-series coupe and the 2-series Active Tourer.

One of the leaders in this budding technology is Bitcoin, a form of electronic money created in 2009. Its currency depends on a network of computers that deal with complicated mathematical problems to form and record the details of each bitcoin transaction, according to an article by Reuters, an international news website.

Bitcoins are created by “mining,” according to the Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin miners use specialized hardware to process transactions and secure the network, which then rewards the network with a certain number of new bitcoins and money collected from a transaction fee.

James Dow, CSUN professor from the department of finance, said it is difficult to use bitcoins because the process is complicated.

“Using bitcoins requires a certain number of computer expertises, while using regular money — anybody on the street can do that,” Dow said.

Bitcoins are kept in a “digital wallet,” a type of virtual bank account permitting people to send or receive bitcoins, purchase goods or save their money, all free from the government’s control and central banks’ intervention, according to a CNN Money article about the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin’s value lies not in physical properties and central authorities, but people’s confidence and their willing to accept them as payment, according to the Bitcoin Foundation.

Several online retailers like Overstock.com and TigerDirect have already started accepting bitcoins, but its adoption is not common, according to the Reuters’ article.

Francesco Giartosio, CEO of GlassUp, smart eyeglass store that deals in bitcoins, said the main purpose of his company accepting bitcoins as an alternative payment is to test customers’ reactions.

“It is an experiment to see if it attracts interest from people who want to spend bitcoins,” Giartosio said.“I would say the experiment has failed because we have sold only one unit.”

On Feb. 25, Mt. Gox, an industry leader in bitcoin exchange, where people can purchase or sell bitcoins under different currencies, shut down its site and closed all transactions, sparking off a host of prospective investors’ anxiety and wavering their confidence in the digital currency, according to an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Mt. Gox users might have lost more than $300 million worth of bitcoins, which was the latest and biggest failure in the virtual currency.

Giartosio said the closure of a bitcoin exchange company was not an isolated incident, and it would happen again in all likelihood.

“Fortunately, our account at Mt. Gox was empty,” Giartosio said. “It would be wise for people to keep little money in bitcoins.”

Dennis Halcoussis, CSUN professor of economics, said the incident at Mt. Gox had a great impact on bitcoin customers and investors.

“Bitcoin has a problem now because people will not feel confident about its future,” Halcoussis said.

Dow said the incident illustrates that the monetary system relies on a number of different institutions to build confidence and support it.

“A new digital currency might not have those institutions to establish, which makes more speculative and risky,” Dow said.

Marin Dajak, co-founder of www.btcgate.com, an online electronics store that accepts bitcoins, said he doesn’t expect a large number of companies to suffer the same fate as Mt. Gox.

“There is a large number of scammers and hackers out there praying on businesses and users, and while this is bad in the end, it will help strengthen the bitcoin economy,” Dajak said. “I believe the incident of Mt. Gox is a good thing, and it will help bring forward a better, more transparent exchange like Bitstamp.”

Dajak added that the main problem with Mt.Gox was poor customer support and lack of transparency and security.

“While Mt.Gox was extremely important in the beginning phases of bitcoins, it simply did not keep up with its potential and grew too big and too fast,” Dajak said.

Claudio Levrini, manager of Bitroad, a bitcoin exchange company selling electronics, said while bitcoin exchange companies take advantages of the digital currency, it is also their duty to make wise decisions an d take security measures.

“Mt. Gox was on the brink of bankruptcy from November last year, and it was known in the community,” Levrini said. “You are responsible to keep your money safe.”

Dajak said the companies that take special precautions regarding security will survive and grow.

Nancy Virts, professor of economics at CSUN, said there are no reasons for merchants to accept bitcoins because it is a very risky investment.

“Money has no intrinsic values, not like gold and coins,” Virts said. “Money is not useful unless people are willing to accept them in payment.”

Virts pointed out that bitcoins are not accepted worldwide partly due to lack of the United States government’s support.

“The advantage of dollar bills is that the US government is willing to accept in payment for taxes, and as a result, businesses are willing to accept in payment not just in the US, but all around the world,” Virts said.

Halcoussis said a currency’s stability comes from the level of people’s confidence rather than the government.

“The dollar is relatively stable because people believe that the U.S. government is stable and the dollar will continue to have value for a long time,” Halcoussis said. “A currency doesn’t have to have a government backing it, but people have to believe it will continue to have value in the future.”

Bitcoin transactions are instant, and its users do not need to have a bank account and disclose their own personal data to third party, Levrini said.

Dajak said there are a variety of advantages of using bitcoins because they are decentralized.

“We are firm believers in bitcoin, and we use it both personally and have decided to use it on our site exclusively to help make it the future of money,” Dajak said. “An added benefit is bringing down processing costs and in turn, offering the lowest possible prices for our customers.”

Dow said the biggest advantages of bitcoins are anonymity and the avoidance of government regulation, which would make it more useful for illegal transactions.

Levrini said the future of bitcoin exchange companies will become more competitive.

“Bitcoin companies are starting to evolve, and some will grow, while others will fall,” Levrini said. “This process will hopefully create a competitive market and push many serious players to participate.”

Levrini said many people are only concerned about bitcoin itself, while the true innovation is the “blockchain” concept, which synchronizes transactions between the digital currency record transactions.

The Bitcoin network depends on the “blockchain,” an electronic ledger that keeps all confirmed transactions of a specific amount of currency from one person to another, according to a blog about bitcoins. Once these transactions spread on the bitcoin network, they will be synchronized and updated on every participant’s computer.

“We accept bitcoin because we believe that this technology will redefine ecommerce and retail payments,” Levrini said. “The blockchain is an innovation that will change many aspect of the financial world forever, and the bitcoin is just the beginning.”

Levrini added that failures are inevitable, but they will be the evolution of new technology.

“Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg, and we will see many different applications coming from this technology,” he said. “In years to come we will see how big the impact of this innovation will be and what road will the progress take.”

Giartosio said the bitcoins will evolve into other forms of digital money in the future.

“Some bigger projects will replace bitcoins if they do not make partnerships with other countries,” he said. “Like Facebook has replaced MySpace, and Android is replacing iOS.”###619||Submit

Putin spoke after President Barack Obama ordered a second round of sanctions targeting about two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major bank supporting them. Moscow made its first retaliatory shot by banning nine U.S. officials and lawmakers from entering Russia.

Putin said in televised remarks at Friday’s session of the presidential Security Council that he sees no immediate need for further Russian retaliation and said sardonically that he would open an account in the Russian bank targeted by the latest U.S. sanctions.

Meanwhile, Russian stocks tumbled Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

The MICEX benchmark was down nearly 3 percent two hours into Friday trading with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were taking a pounding, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops or online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

Russia’s central bank sought to assure that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. authorities “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.” However, it added that the government could “take necessary steps to support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.

Sources familiar with the deal told CNN that Toyota Motor Corporation was expected to avoid criminal charges.

It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content."Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens," it said.San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message."Twitter, mwitter!," Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!""We will wipe out all of these," said Erdogan, who has cast the corruption scandal as part of a smear campaign by his political enemies."The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is," he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.Twitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread outages overnight. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator (TIB) citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.The corruption investigation became public on December 17 when police detained the sons of three cabinet ministers and businessmen close to Erdogan. The three ministers resigned a week later, while others were removed in a cabinet reshuffle.At an extraordinary session on Wednesday, parliament's speaker blocked opposition pleas to have a prosecutor's report with allegations against the former ministers read out.A document purporting to be that report appeared on Twitter last week. It included alleged transcripts of wiretapped phone conversations, pictures from physical surveillance and pictures of official documents accusing the former ministers and two of their sons of involvement with an Iranian businessman in a bribery and smuggling racket.Reuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the document.Turkish Internet users were quick to come up with ways to circumvent the block. The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly moved among the top trending globally.The disruption sparked a virtual uproar, with many comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.There were also calls to take to the street to protest, although some users equally called for calm.Nazli Ilicak, a columnist who used to work for the pro-government Sabah newspaper described the move as "a civil coup" in an interview on broadcaster CNN Turk.The move was only the latest clash between Turkey's ruling party and social media companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter.After a series of popular protests partly fuelled by Twitter last summer, Erdogan slammed the service as "a scourge."Shortly thereafter a government minister asked Twitter to establish an office in Turkey so that it could better communicate requests to take down content or hold the company accountable to Turkish law. Twitter did not respond to the request.Erdogan said two weeks ago that Turkey could also ban Facebook and YouTube, which he says have been abused by his enemies after a stream of audio recordings purportedly revealing corruption in his inner circle emerged online.But a senior official said on Friday there were no immediate plans to do so."The path was taken to block access within the framework of a court decision because of the failure to overcome the problem with the management of Twitter," the official said."At the moment there is no such a decision for Facebook and other social media," he told Reuters.© Thomson Reuters 2014###630||Empty###631||Empty###632||Twitter is working to restore service to Turkish citizens on Friday, after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blocked access to the microblogging social network earlier this week.

“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform,” Twitter’s policy team said in a tweeted statement. “We hope to have full access returned soon.”

The ban came shortly after anonymous users posted audio clips of what could be incriminating evidence of Erdogan and other top Turkish officials engaging in corruption — clips that emerged just days before key local elections in the country. Erdogan apparently used a court order to command Turkey’s telecommunications authority to block Twitter use within the country, though many have found easy ways to circumvent the ban and access the service.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul spoke out against Erdogan’s actions — in a series of tweets, appropriately enough — claiming that suppression of the service should occur only if citizens’ personal freedoms were being violated. The White House also issued a statement on Friday railing against Erdogan’s ban.

“We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association,” the White House said in a statement. “We have conveyed our serious concern to the Turkish government, urge Turkish authorities to respect the freedom of the press by permitting the independent and unfettered operation of media of all kinds, and support the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies.”

Turkish citizens are no strangers to censorship; in the past, government officials have blocked access to YouTube for offensive comments against leadership at the time. This is the first time Twitter — a company that prides itself on providing a free-speech platform for people around the world — has been blocked in the country.

Currently, however, Facebook has not been blocked by the Turkish government. Facebook declined to comment when asked if it had received any takedown requests from Turkey. A senior Turkish official told Reuters that the government had no plans to block Facebook or other social networks.###633||Empty###634||The Winning Mega Millions Numbers Are …

###637||DENVER | Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, extending to medical pot the same restrictions in place for recreational pot.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don’t illegally access marijuana.

“Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids,” Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the Legislature.

“Everyone came together on this,” said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

A pediatric emergency room physician from Children’s Hospital Colorado, Dr. George Sam Wang, joined the bill signing and said there’s anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said that there’s not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

“We’ve only been experiencing this for a couple years,” Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.

Asked whether the marijuana industry needs additional curbs — including a possible potency limit or new limits on edible pot — Hickenlooper said it was too soon to advocate for more sweeping changes.

“This is brand-new territory,” Hickenlooper said.

Some lawmakers have said they want to propose curbs on edible pot, but no such bill has yet been introduced.

Legislators planned to meet Monday afternoon with marijuana industry lobbyists to discuss pot taxes. The first $40 million from pot excise taxes is devoted to education, but lawmakers will decide how to spend any additional tax revenue.
