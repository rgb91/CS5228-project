Given the uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. recovery, and the impact tapering may have on developing economies, the OECD said while it is right for the U.S. Federal Reserve to scale back its asset purchase program, it should do so gradually over the next two years.
The OECD said the potential for further periods of financial market volatility and capital outflows from developing economies as the Fed and other central banks prepare to reduce their stimulus is one of the most significant threats to the global recovery.

The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was established in 2012 to provide financial assistance to member states within the euro area experiencing financial difficulties.
European bailout funds are financed through the ESM, which can lend up to EUR 500 billion total, The Economist reported in October.
At the time, EUR 100 billion had reportedly been earmarked for the recapitalization of Spain’s financial sector, and EUR 9 billion had been set aside for Cyprus, leaving EUR 391 billion total.
According to the court statement, although some of the complaints involved in the ESM actions have been dismissed, the court noted the imperative of ensuring that arrangements are made under budgetary law to: “ensure that possible capital calls pursuant to the ESM Treaty can be met fully and in time within the agreed-upon upper limits, so that a suspension of Germanyâ€™s voting rights in the ESM bodies is reliably excluded.”###435||Business NewsUS stocks dip on weak China, Japan dataPublished on: Tuesday, March 11, 2014by AAPUS stocks have slipped as weak economic data from China and Japan raised questions about the growth outlook in Asia.

In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said.
"However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance.
If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###498||Harriet GreenBruno Guillon, the chief executive of fashion house Mulberry, has resigned “with immediate effect”.
