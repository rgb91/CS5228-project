Health plans selling on the federal marketplaces in 2015 must include 30 percent of area "essential community providers," which are usually health centers and other hospitals serving mostly low-income patients.
That's up from a 20 percent requirement in 2014, the first year of expanded overage under the health care law.
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, will also take a much more active role in reviewing health plan networks.
It also builds on small business insurance marketplaces, which have face several delays in the law's rollout.###3190||The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

"Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports.

More specifically, Against Elderly Abuse, a Hong Kong welfare agency, noted a trend of Chinese women in their thirties from Hubei and Hunan provinces marrying public tenants “over 60 years old living on welfare,” and cautioned such men to “use caution” as such marriages often turn out “too good to be true.”The eagerness of some elderly Hong Kong men to walk down the aisle with much younger Chinese women seems to be against the grain in terms of overall Hong Kongers’ distaste for Chinese, but in line with cross-border male preferences for younger female partners.

The toasted sandwich company said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan.
The company only owns and operates seven of the nearly 2,100 Quiznos restaurants.

Tristano said that while Quiznos might be able to slow its decline, the chances of returning to its heyday, when more than 4,000 Quiznos restaurants were operating, are slim.###3596||Empty###3597||Why did this happen?

Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes between Ukraine and Russia have led to gas supply cuts.

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,371.76 an ounce by 0737 GMT, after jumping 1.3 percent on Wednesday.
“Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold.”Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at $1,375-$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards $1,433.31, the Aug. 28 high.
The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.
Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China - the biggest bullion consumer - trading at a discount to spot prices.###3847||Empty###3848||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.
