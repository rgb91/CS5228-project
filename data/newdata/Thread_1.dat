New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.

Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.

Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption.

The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.

Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula.

Maury Leyland, a Fonterra manager said: "We have accepted all four charges, which are consistent with the findings of our operational review and the Independent Board Inquiry."

The dairy co-operative has since stepped up its quality control procedures.

Exporting dairy product that failed to meet relevant animal product standards

Failing to notify its verifier of significant concerns that dairy product had not been processed in accordance with its Risk Management Programme

Failing to notify the Director General as soon as possible that exported dairy product was not fit for intended purpose NZ Ministry for Primary Industries

In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning.

The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.

But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.

The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare.

Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.###1007||Shares in Fyffes have jumped by a third after news that U.S. fruit distributor Chiquita Brands International Inc is to buy its Ireland-based rival for $526 million. Newslook###1008||LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from UK lawmakers on Tuesday about what Bank officials knew about allegations that currency traders colluded to manipulate key exchange rates.

The unfolding scandal has so far seen more than 20 traders placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world’s biggest banks.

Below is a timeline on the scandal that has engulfed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, the world’s biggest financial market and which is now subject to a global investigation.

July 2006: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say the group, chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett, discussed “evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that ‘fixing business’ generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour.”

Spring 2008: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with “the relevant authorities in the UK.”

May 2008: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say there was “considerable discussion” on the benchmark “fixings” again.

July 2008: A meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion “that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation,” BoE minutes say.

April 2012: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular chief FX dealers’ meeting included a “brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings,” BoE minutes say.

June 2013: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London “fixing”.

July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers’ meeting for 4 July never takes place.

Sept. 2013: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing.

Oct 2013: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland’s market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating.

Dec 2013: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms.

Jan 2014: U.S. regulators visit Citi’s main offices in London. Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers’ sub-group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked.

Feb 4, 2014: Martin Wheatley, chief executive the FCA, Britain’s market regulator, says the FX allegations are “every bit as bad” as those in Libor. He also says the FCA’s investigation will probably run into next year.

Feb 5, 2014: New York’s banking regulator opens its investigation.

Feb 14, 2014: The Financial Stability Board, the world’s top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings.

March 5, 2014: The Bank of England suspends an employee as part of its internal investigation.###1009||Empty###1010||Empty###1011||DARLINGTON, England, March 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will delay raising interest rates from their record low 0.5 percent if sterling strengthens further, deputy governor Charlie Bean said on Monday.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.

“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.

In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###1016||American Transit Ridership Hits 57-Year High

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.###1017||Empty###1018||(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical recovered a tad in afternoon trade after falling more than six per cent in the morning. The shares were down about four per cent at Rs 580.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.###1019||Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.###1021||CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

Gold prices edged higher on Monday as the ongoing Russian standoff in Ukraine bolstered the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge, though Friday's strong U.S. jobs report and soft Chinese trade figures watered down gains. Gold gains on Ukraine standoff, soft Chinese data weigh Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Monday. Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices. Strong U.S. employment numbers and weak Chinese trade figures strengthened the dollar and capped gold's gains, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase. January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000. The data extended the dollar's gains into Monday, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.###1022||Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has staged a two-year war against Herbalife, betting that authorities in the US and other countries like China would ultimately determine the health-products retailer to be an illegal pyramid scheme.

Today Herbalife revealed that it had received a “civil investigative demand” from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulatory agency’s web site says it uses civil investigative demands to look into possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The mere announcement is a much-needed shot in the arm for Ackman’s Pershing Square fund, which has spent nearly $1.2 billion shorting Herbalife shares (i.e., betting that the price will decline). The stock, which was up some 40% since Ackman first announced he was shorting it in 2012, tumbled sharply after the news broke, ending about 7% down on the day’s trading. Herbalife defended itself in a statement on its site:

Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years.

The fight over Herbalife has been an oftentimes acrimonious battle between Ackman and other prominent investors who have bet that the stock would rise instead of falling. They include Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb (who held his stake for just two weeks) and George Soros (who trimmed his stake recently).

The contentious scene is eerily similar to Ackman’s six-year campaign against speciality insurance companies MBIA and Ambac back in 2007. Ackman eventually scored a $1.1 billion win on those deals, as documented in the book Confidence Game by former Bloomberg reporter Christine Richard.

Today’s news also comes seven months after Ackman threw in the towel on one of his biggest investments, a bullish bet on retailer JC Penney. That cost him nearly $500 million and dinged his reputation.



The high-profile jousting of billionaire hedge fund managers may look juvenile, but their antics are bringing the money flooding in. According to a recent Moody’s report, assets under management for activist funds—those that, like Ackman’s, put pressure on companies in an attempt to bring about changes that affect the share price—increased by 42% last year, to $93 billion from $65.5 billion in 2012.###1023||New York/London: Gold tumbled 1 percent on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth accelerated sharply, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

Bullion pared some early losses after benchmark 10-year Treasury yields gave back some gains after initially rising to a six-week high. Weaker U.S. equities after early advances also helped lift gold from its lows.

Employers added 175,000 jobs to their payrolls last month up from January`s 129,000 new positions, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent, as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.

"It`s a decent data point but who knows how valid it is because of the weather and so forth," said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of California-based Merk Funds, which has more than $400 million in currency mutual fund assets.

"Ultimately, the Fed is not interested in tightening any time soon because Yellen says she doesn`t think inflation is a problem," which boosts gold`s appeal as a hedge, he said.

Spot gold fell as much as 1.5 percent to a session low of USD 1,329.35 an ounce, and was last trading down 1 percent at USD 1,337.19 by 1:11 p.m. EST (1811 GMT).

U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery fell USD 14 to USD 1,337.80 an ounce, with trading volume about 20 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.

The metal, seen as a safe haven, was still on track for a fifth straight week of gains, capitalising on gains made earlier in the week when tensions in Ukraine escalated.

"In the short term, given the better-than-expected data, and provided nothing happens in Ukraine over the weekend, gold could fall below USD 1,330," VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said.

On Friday, President Vladimir Putin rebuffed a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over Moscow`s military intervention in Crimea, saying that Russia could not ignore calls for help from Russian speakers in Ukraine.

PALLADIUM UP ON RUSSIA, S.AFRICA

Palladium posted its biggest weekly gain in nearly eight months, with a 5 percent increase. It was last trading up 17 cents on the day at USD 777.47 an ounce, having hit a one-year high of USD 781.50 an ounce on Thursday.

Political tensions in top producer Russia and union strikes in second-biggest producer South Africa have triggered fears of supply constraints.

Platinum also notched its second straight weekly gain, up 2.6 percent. It edged up 39 cents on the day at USD 1,477.99.

There is no sign of an end to a six-week old platinum strike in South Africa. Wage talks collapsed earlier this week between the country`s powerful mineworker union AMCU and the world`s three top producers.

Silver fell 2.5 percent to USD 20.91 an ounce.###1024||Despite their surprisingly rapid recovery five years after being placed into government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be dissolved, if bi-partisan legislation announced today by the Senate banking committee eventually passes.

Under the bill, private capital would have to take the first 10 percent of all mortgage losses, effectively removing much of the firm federal backing that mortgage-backed securities repackaged by Fannie and Freddie have enjoyed.

The change represents a significant scale back of the government’s role in real estate finance.

In place of the government-sponsored enterprises, a Federal Mortgage Insurance Corp.–an entity similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.–will be formed. It is intended to ensure that financing remain available to all qualified borrowers. The FMIC will generate funds through user fees of 10 basis points per transaction, instead of using tax dollars.

“Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable,” Idaho Senator Mike Crapo said in a press release Tuesday morning.

The goal of the bill, more detail on which will be available later this week, is to eliminate Fannie and Freddie entirely, the statement said. The reform will “move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages,” and avoiding future bailouts, according to Mr. Crapo.

The announcement was a surprise, even for close observers of real estate finance and policy, said Martin Schuh, vice president of regulatory policy at the commercial real estate finance council, a trade group. He was present at a briefing by the banking committee this morning in Washington D.C.

“This one caught everyone off guard,” he said. However, “the five years is pretty aggressive,” as a timeframe to wind down the multi-billion dollar enterprises, he warned.

His group was pleased that the bill will aim to treat Fannie and Freddie’s multifamily business as distinct from their single-family financing arms and will likely sell it off. “They specifically said they want to spin off [the multifamily] platforms… I see [the multifamily component] being attractive to investors tomorrow,” Mr. Schuh said.

Not everyone was quite so effusive.

“Today is a bad day,” Robert Ivanhoe, head of the real estate practice at Greenberg Traurig, told Mortgage Observer via email. “I am sure many people in the real estate industry are concerned about the winding down of the largest source of liquidity for multifamily apartment properties, by far, and how they will be financed in the future.” He predicted the change would destabilize the multifamily sector.

The bill does have bipartisan support. The unfortunately named Crapo teamed up with Democrat and banking committee chair Tim Johnson to craft the proposed legislation. But numerous sources said they do not expect the bill to make it through the House in its current form.

“I don’t think it survives much past this congress,” said Mr. Schuh. “But the important thing is that this is where all the future discussions will start.”

Recently published calculations from the Office of Management and Budget said the GSEs were on course to return $179 billion in profits to taxpayers in the next decade, if allowed to continue operating in conservatorship, making the attack on the agencies today even more surprising.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy,” Senator Johnson said in the joint statement. But industry experts told Mortgage Observer that GSE reform was “presumed dead.”

Rick Lazio, former U. S. representative and real estate attorney with Jones Walker, agreed that the bill was a good starting point but would likely not make it into law intact. But he disagreed that the bill was a boon to the multifamily lending climate.

“Multifamily lenders overwhelmingly like the programs as they exist now,” he said. “They never lost a dime even through the worst of the downturn.”

Now, they will lose their federal guarantees, for the most part, even though their business was not what caused Fannie and Freddie to fall back on the government’s coffers.

The new rules would allow private label securities to be issued — with the goal of improving liquidity — but those will have lighter government backing, which kicks in only after the private originator has taken the required 10 percent loss. The securities would be sold via a unified platform and buyers would pay “risk-adjusted” prices for them, Mr. Lazio said.

“There will continue to be a federal role in multifamily lending,” Mr. Lazio said, but “there will be a limited guarantee.”

A representative for Fannie Mae said that due to the terms of their conservatorship, they could not comment on pending legislation.###1025||Empty###1026||Empty###1027||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Analysts reckon that Alibaba could seek to raise up to $15bn (£9bn) through the share sale in a move which could value it at between $150bn and $200bn. Details of the float may come as early as April.

At the top end, that would make Alibaba the world’s second most valuable internet company after Google, which is valued at $394bn. Amazon and Facebook both have stock market values of $172bn.

Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma and 17 friends in 1999, when it offered just 22 items on its website. It has grown to dominate Chinese e-commerce and Mr Ma’s wealth is estimated at $11.4bn. The firm employs more than 20,000 and is said to account for 70 per cent of all packages delivered in China.

The firm has not decided whether to float on the New York Stock Exchange or its more tech-heavy rival Nasdaq, but it has ruled out Hong Kong.

“Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,” the company said yesterday. “This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.”

More than $150bn-worth of merchandise changes hands on Alibaba’s different online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay put together.

The firm has nine major websites, which include consumers selling to consumers, businesses selling to consumers and to each other, global and domestic selling platforms, cloud computing and an electronic payment system.

China is second only to India in the number of internet users it has at 618 million.

McKinsey & Co has forecast its internet retail market will treble in size between 2011 and 2015 to $395bn.

In its latest figures, for the three months to September 2013, Alibaba’s quarter-on-quarter profits grew by 12 per cent to $792m on revenues up by 51 per cent at $1.78bn. In the same quarter Facebook’s profit was $422m.

Mr Ma, who owns a 7.4 per cent stake in the business, is understood to have favoured a US IPO over one in Hong Kong because it would enable he and his partners to maintain control of the business. Hong Kong Stock Exchange does not permit different classes of shares. But US markets have enabled people like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to keep control of their businesses after going public.

Alibaba said that it could still list shares in China at a later date. It said: “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”

The share sale could prove a massive $260m windfall for the investment banks chosen to advise on it, based on the usual 1.75 per cent underwiting fees they charge.

Alibaba is in discussions with Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley for lead underwriting roles. Most of the banks are likely to end up with at least some role in the share offer.

Yahoo owns a 24 per cent stake in Alibaba and Japan’s Softbank has a 37 per cent stake. They could both sell shares in the offer.

From China with smiles; Alibaba founder Jack Ma

Jack Ma, 49, was born in the city of Hangzhou and started as an English teacher and tour guide. On one of his trips he showed Yahoo founder Jerry Yang the Great Wall.

Alibaba took off as a way for Chinese firms to showcase their goods to the West, and Yahoo bought a $1bn stake.

Mr Ma stepped down as CEO last year but remains chairman. He has shifted his focus to improving health and education in China.

“If we don’t do this then young Chinese people will grow up with deep pockets but shallow minds,” he said.

The probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan was reported by Bloomberg, Reuters and the New York Times, citing unnamed sources.

The U.S. attorney’s office declined to either confirm or deny it was pursuing an investigation, and a spokesman said the office generally does not speak about investigations in the early stages.

General Motors spokesman Alan Adler said Tuesday night the company had no comment.

General Motors knew a decade ago of issues with the ignition switches of several popular models, including the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac’s G5 and Solstice, and Saturn’s Sky and Ion.

It only announced a recall in February. Nearly two weeks later, it expanded the number of affected vehicles from 780,000 to 1.4 million. It also disclosed additional deaths.

Federal law requires automakers notify a federal safety board within five days of discovering an issue.

GM’s new CEO, Mary Barra, recently defended the company’s actions in a letter to employees, saying it acted “without hesitation” and “well beyond” recommendations by technical experts. Another company official said GM’s review of the issue “was not as robust as it should have been.”

The criminal investigation would join reviews led by the National Transportation Safety Administration, Congress and an internal probe.

W Hong Kong is a five-star boutique hotel in

INTERVIEW

Hong Kong with 393 rooms. W Hong Kong combines the personality and style of an independent hotel with the reliability and attentive service of a major business hotel. It mixes cutting-edge design with local influences, creating a place to play and work by day or to mix and mingle by night.

You graduated from the Rutgers University in New Jersey in the US with an MBA

degree. Did you work on your degree while working in the hotel industry?

I worked and studied at the same time. I've always had the ambition of wanting to get

What motivated you to go into the hotel industry?

an MBA. When I was in my 30s, I was working in Shanghai as the Marketing Director at Hyatt. I thought it was the time to do it. I studied during the weekends and evenings. It was an Executive MBA and it lasted for 14 months. Professors would fly to Shanghai to give lectures. I won't say it was easy.

I was a typical young guy who didn't know what he wanted to do. I was rather naïve and

impressionable. I was interested in luxury brands in high-end retail and hotels. I went to work part- time in other luxury businesses but I didn't really like it because it was not what I had expected. The customers didn't seem grounded in most people's reality and were often simply interested in showing off. The next summer I went to work for Conrad Jupiters Casino on the Golf Coast in Australia as a steward. It was a terrible job! I remember I kept checking the clock hoping time would go faster. But the job did introduce me to the hotel business.

I was very lucky that the Chairman of my father's company was also the Chairman of

Conrad Jupiters. He gave me a recommendation to be interviewed by the GM, Ron Hughes. He was an inspiration and one of the people who got me excited about the hotel industry.

When I graduated with my Bachelor's degree, I looked for the best hotel group that

could provide young people with good career opportunities. I chose Hyatt because it had a good corporate training program which had a record of bringing young people into management jobs quickly. I started as a bellboy. When my fellow economics graduate friends came and stayed at the resort hotel on the weekends, I had to carry their bags... We all had a good laugh.

You worked for Hyatt for more than 15 years. Comparing Hyatt and W Hotel,

they have entirely different brand images and possibly different target markets. What prompted you to work for W Hong Kong?

I left Hyatt to join Starwood (Sheraton Tower in Singapore). These are quite different

companies. Hyatt's culture feels more like a family, whereas Starwood measures everything, including your performance, which made things less complicated and there were also no hidden agendas. W Hong Kong is located next to three big banks, and they are our corporate customers. Many bankers like to come to our hotel after work. It's quite funny that you see them standing next to guys who are from the creative industry who have tattoos and body piercings everywhere. I think they enjoy seeing the diversity of guests, many of whom are from outside of their normal circles.

Our core business is the corporate market. Of course, many of them are from

companies such as Apple and advertising agencies. We also cater to smaller MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibitions) as well as the high-end leisure market. At W, we have to be able to cater to the traditional markets and at the same time, we have to be able to do the "W" thing with DJ music and big parties, where we collaborate with the fashion industry, music industry, design industry, etc. It's a fun twist on a luxury hotel. But that fun twist can be easily seen as a gimmick if we don't have our basic service standards in place, we don't have the right to do the fun things at the W. We are a luxury hotel and we need to deliver.

To answer your question, when I started working for Hyatt after my corporate training

program, they put me in marketing. When I started as the GM of Westin Fuzhou, Fujian in China, they sent me to W, which is a very marketing-oriented company. I naturally drift towards marketing even though I am the GM...

You have spent nearly your entire career in Asia. What motivates you to stay in

Asia?

I feel like Asia is the center of the world somehow. I am Australian. When you work in

Australia, you are dealing with primarily domestic businesses. When you are young, you want to travel and see the world. So, it was relatively less interesting to me to stay in Australia. I was also intrigued by Asia; I have mostly worked in China and Hong Kong. It is so diverse and so different. I have experienced so many years in one region, I feel that I have adopted some of the Asian values. I am married to a Korean.

But I don't think you speak Korean...

It's true. I don't speak Korean and I am ashamed of it. But I have never worked in

Korea. I used to laugh at some of my colleagues who were married to someone from a different nationality yet couldn't speak more than a few sentences of their spouses native language, but I've become one of them.

You speak Mandarin and Cantonese (Chinese). Which aspects of the Chinese

culture do you enjoy the most? Which aspects of the culture do you find most difficult to adjust to?

One thing about the Chinese is that they have this sense of loyalty. If you were their

boss, even after 10 years, they would still think of you as their boss. They feel that they have this commitment to you. It's one of the things I admire the most. The Australian culture is so different. We are very direct and not very self-conscious. I think trying to be self-conscious is the most difficult thing to overcome. Initially in Asia I had difficulty reading between the lines. People didn't understand when I asked: "Why can't you just come out and tell me?"

I understand it now. It is an aspect of caring: The fact that you bother to read between

the lines as opposed to just expecting people to tell you. It takes a lot to adjust to the sensitive side of the culture; to be able to read people's inner thoughts without being told explicitly. I think I have learned a lot. It has made me a better person; a more understanding person.

What are the most challenging issues you are facing on your current position?

It took me over one year to adjust to the W brand concept, which means constantly

trying to invent new and different ideas. Although W offers a high-level style of service, the service is not always formal. Often, it is more casual. It is much easier to be formal. We often have events such as pool parties with 300 or 400 guests, loud music and dancing until midnight. At the same time, we have to adjust to other hotel guests' needs. For example, a banker tries to check in at 3:00 in the morning and sees a wild party in full swing. It's difficult to adjust at times.

What do you do at work that you enjoy so much you actually lose track of

time?

Being on time and planning well is important to being successful in our business. I don't

usually lose track of time. I think the only time I lose track of time is at the end of the day, say 7:00 PM, I start to work on things like answering e-mails, signing checks, etc. That's when I could lose track of time.

If you could relive one day of your life, which day would you choose?

It may sound like a bit of a cliché but it would be my wedding day. It was a great day!

In the eyes of your employees, what is the single most important quality you

should have?

I think I have to have understanding because it is difficult to make judgment calls when

you are leading several hundred employees. There are a lot issues going on everyday and you need to have feedback in order to understand the circumstances. It's not just being an understanding person; it is about having the information to know what is happening: What challenges my people are facing and how we can help them. I guess a lot of it is about talking to people at different levels in the organization. In our hotel we have an annual program in which every manager must work one day in a junior staff's position, and it could be housekeeping, a pastry chef, or an engineer in order to understand how difficult some of the jobs are.

In your opinion, what is the single best quality your employees can possess?

Curiosity! They need to be hardworking and disciplined, of course. But first of all, we like

What are the things that you do not like to do?

our employees to grow. The only way you can grow is taking interest and being curious, so that you can learn and grow. Also, people in hotels tend to form tight teams. They need to be curious outside of their teams. We always encourage people to take interest in how other departments work and learn how to work with them.

I don't like to do the same old thing over and over. That's something that has grown on

me since I joined the W brand. We always reinvent things. I encourage my people to do things differently internally and for our guests. You could do it in every hotel but at W, it is easier to have this approach. You have to look for something that will elevate the brand by capturing people's interest and generate profit at the same time. There is a trade off though. For example, when a team has been serving Japanese cuisine in the same restaurant, in the same way for 10 years, they become really good at it.

Some people say that a GM is not important to his frontline employees. Do

you agree?

If the GM is not important for the talent, something is wrong. The GM often makes the

final decisions because he provides the direction for the steering committee, although it may not be obvious. Maybe if the GM was more understanding and showed his face more frequently, he would make a better impression on his people. The GM must be relevant and important to his frontline employees.

If you must make a choice, would you do the things right or would you do the

right things?

Do the right things! As the GM, your role is to always be a figurehead and the leader.

What are your strengths and weaknesses?

You have to do yourself proud. Doing the right things is a matter of integrity. If you do the right thing, people will follow.

I am more of a big-picture person. I don't mind digging into details to find out what's

not working but I would much rather come up with new concepts and creative ideas. For me, if I have to study a spreadsheet trying to find out what's wrong, it's not my strength. It's my weakness.

As for my strengths, I am not afraid to take chances. Also, emotional intelligence is my

At work, what puts a smile on your face?

strength; I trust my gut feeling.

When our team comes up with an innovative idea to organize an event, and it's really

What puts a frown on your face?

working and you can feel the energy of the event. It puts a smile on my face.

People who are inconsiderate to guests and talents put a frown on my face. In the hotel

business, you do have to deal with difficult guests. I think it's ridiculous when people rely on their seniority or status trying to get things done. It will never work.

If you didn't know how old you are, how old would you like to be?

I am optimistic. I believe life is going to be better. I am 45 now. Of course, it's

How have you changed in the past five years?

wonderful to be young. I could do a lot of sports that I am not able to do anymore. But if I have to pick an age, I think 55 will be a great age as my career will be at another level. By that time, I will be doing something very interesting but I don't know what yet.

I've been humbled --- not that I was arrogant before. I moved out of marketing and

into operations. It has been five years since I became a GM. When I was the GM of Westin in China, there were young department heads who were willing to go anywhere in China in order to get better opportunities. I'd never come across anything like this before. It humbled me. I learned a lot!

Also, I went through a very tough leadership role that required operational focus in

China to open the hotel. Then I was given the opportunity to work in this amazing and stylish hotel here in Hong Kong. After working in two extremely different environments, I've learned to appreciate working with different people and gained some strength along the way. I've learned the reality of hotel operations. It doesn't just happen. It takes people to make it happen.

What advice would you offer to those who are inspired to become successful in

the hotel industry?

Be curious because it's too easy to keep doing what you are doing. If you keep doing

What's next?

the same thing, you won't learn as fast as you could. Ambitious young people who are waiting for being promoted tend to get frustrated. I was the same way. But sometimes you are not ready. So, I think you have to have faith. I think you have to take a chance. You can't be too conservative and afraid that your decision might be wrong. If you feel like you want to do it, you better get on and do it!

I'm not sure. I'm sure things will come along. I love the W brand. It's a great brand to

work for. I am looking forward for the "right challenge" within the brand. I'm addicted to the nontraditional hotel concept.

My next step will be something nontraditional but in a higher end hotel. The decisions

are more and more centrally controlled. We are here to execute the brand created by someone else for the benefit of the company. I would like to create something. I don't know what it is going to be yet. I am not saying that it will be the next thing I do. Maybe it will be something within the framework of a big company...

LONDON, March 18 — Britain shook up the Bank of England today, appointing two new deputy governors, breaking the all-male grip at the top, and a chief economist who has been critical of the banking industry.International Monetary Fund official Nemat Shafik will become the first woman to have a top policy role at the BoE since 2010 as its new deputy governor for markets and banking.

Ben Broadbent, up until now an external member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, will step up to become deputy governor for monetary policy.

In a third move, Andy Haldane, the BoE’s executive director for financial stability, is swapping jobs with chief economist Spencer Dale, who will lose his MPC seat from the start of June.

Dale had been seen as a favourite to become deputy governor. Haldane has been unusually outspoken for a central banker, criticising banks for trying to dodge regulation and addressing anti-capitalism protesters.

The changes — made by BoE Governor Mark Carney and the British government — are part of an overhaul at the Bank that Carney is pursuing to break down barriers between its monetary policy and bank regulation wings.

One of the biggest losers from the upheaval is markets director Paul Fisher who will have to give up his MPC seat to Shafik from August 1.

Fisher has been under fire from lawmakers over the BoE’s handling of alleged manipulation of London’s foreign exchange market.

“This shows the extent to which Mark Carney is reshaping the bank,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. “He’s serious about making reform, not only to the structure of the Bank ... but also in terms of its culture.”

Prior to Today’s announcement, Carney had overseen the appointment of outsiders to two other top positions at the Bank.

New deputy governors

Broadbent was formerly a senior economist at Goldman Sachs — Carney’s employer before he became a central banker — and he will succeed Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June.

Broadbent has said the failure of troubled banks to lend money to more efficient firms is one of the reasons behind Britain’s weak economic productivity since the financial crisis.Shafik — who holds Egyptian, US and British nationality — has a background in development economics, working at the World Bank and as the top civil servant at Britain’s overseas aid department, before becoming deputy managing director at the IMF.

She oversaw much of the IMF’s work in the turnaround programs for Greece and Portugal.

Shafik will be responsible for the BoE’s eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy — under which it amassed £375 billion (RM2.043 trillion) of government bonds — as well as reviewing the way the central bank gathers intelligence on markets which has come under scrutiny recently after claims that London traders manipulated key foreign exchange rates.

Since taking office in July, Carney has been keen to increase the number of women in senior roles at the BoE.

BNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments were a surprise, and would add “a degree of raised uncertainty” about when the central bank would start to raise interest rates from their record low 0.5 per cent.

Little is known about Shafik or Haldane’s views on monetary policy. Broadbent and Dale both voted against the BoE’s final expansion of asset purchases in July 2012, while Fisher was part of a dovish minority under former governor Mervyn King who wanted more asset purchases up until King’s departure in June.

Broadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor at the central bank.

He will be responsible for the BoE’s analysis of Britain’s economy, as well as bank notes.

Britain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the BoE’s Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank. Habgood is chairman of brewer Whitbread and publishing company Reed Elsevier .

Habgood succeeds David Lees, whose term expires on July 1. — Reuters###1043||Empty###1044||(Kitco News) - Gold prices are sporting good gains and hit a six-month high in early U.S. trading Wednesday. More safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish technical posture are prompting buying interest in the yellow metal. April gold was last up $14.40 at $1,361.10 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $11.10 at $1,361.00. May Comex silver last traded up $0.205 at $21.02 an ounce.

The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. The Group of Seven nations is set to release a statement later Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s likely that the G-7 will soon impose official economic and diplomatic sanctions on Russia. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. The Russian occupation of Crimea has been a bullish factor for the safe-haven gold market.

In other overnight news, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank’s monetary policy. The ECB has been battling tepid EU economic growth and deflationary concerns with a very stimulative monetary policy.

While gold and the raw commodity sector have fared well in the first quarter of 2014, the copper market has seen its price fall dramatically the past week. Comex copper futures prices hit a nearly four-year low Wednesday. Part of the selling pressure on copper comes from concerns about weakening Chinese economic growth. Crude oil prices have also been pressured in part by the concerns about a weakening Chinese economy. China is the world’s largest copper consumer. Copper is a major industrial metal worldwide. And many veteran stock market watchers say copper’s price move can be a harbinger of price action in the U.S. stock market. Concern about the health of the Chinese economy has weighed down the Asian and European stock markets this week. The fact gold has been able to make gains this week, despite the above circumstances, is impressive.

U.S. economic data due for release Wednesday is again light and includes the weekly MBA mortgage applications survey, the monthly budget statement, and the weekly DOE liquid energy stocks report.

The losses came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the United States, while investors are keeping an eye on events in Ukraine as leaders try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

Tokyo slipped 1.01 percent, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93 percent, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03 percent lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.

Shanghai dived 2.86 percent, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75 percent, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.

Beijing said Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98 billion in February.

The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8 billion in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $11.9 billion surplus. Exports fell 18.1 percent and imports jumped 10.1 percent.

“It’s hard to ignore a number that looks like that,” said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.

Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2.0 percent in February, down from 2.5 percent in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.

While authorities blame the country’s holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness.

The sell-off on Monday is “symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers”, he told Dow Jones Newswires.

In Japan the government said Monday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2 percent in the quarter to December and 1.5 percent through 2013, slower than first thought.

Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3 percent in October-December period and 1.6 percent over the year.

While the data still marked Japan’s best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.

After the merger of Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, the two together will have more than 1,700 stores in the United States, with approximately 23,000 employees and annual sales of about $3.5 billion. The deal totals out at $1.8 billion, with the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approving the transaction.

The two companies have been attempting to take each other over for months. Jos. A. Bank. sought to acquire Men’s Wearhouse for $48 a share, or $2.3 billion in a surprise bid in October, but dropped its offer by mid-November. In December, Men’s Wearhouse struck back with $1.5 billion bid that led to the current agreement.

Jos. A. Bank board chairman Robert N. Wildrick the final $65-per-share deal was satisfactory to his shareholders. Jos. A. Bank’s stock has never traded for the $65 per share, and over the past year—its strongest 12 months—it traded between $40 and $60 per share.

“The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men’s Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings,” Wildrick said in a statement.

As part of the deail, Jos. A. Bank agreed to scrap its agreement with Everest Holdings LLC to buy subsidiary Eddie Bauer.

Despite the contention between the two companies, Men’s Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert struck a conciliatory tone. “All of us at Men’s Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank’s talented employees,” he said.###1052||World stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 per cent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide. The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 per cent to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York. Prices on benchmark 10-year US Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 per cent.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.26 points or 0.43 per cent, to 16,382.46, the S&P 500 lost 5.11 points or 0.27 percent, to 1,872.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.229 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,324.994.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.3 per cent to $31.14 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6 per cent.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 per cent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.6 per cent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3 per cent. In the metals markets, London copper hit an eight-month low. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded down 1.36 percent to $6,690 a tonne. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest level since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

Brent crude was trading 97 cents down at $108.03.

What the hell is it? It's a good question and answers vary widely.



Bloomberg reports Japan Says Bitcoin Not Currency Amid Calls for Regulation.

Japan’s government said Bitcoin isn’t a currency amid calls for its regulation a week after the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that was once the world’s biggest.



There is no law to define Bitcoin and relevant ministries are gathering information on it, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet said in a statement in response to questions from an opposition party lawmaker. Bitcoin transactions can be taxed, according to the statement obtained by Bloomberg News.



Japan isn’t the only country grappling with the regulation of Bitcoin amid reports of hacking into exchanges including Mt. Gox and concern that the virtual currency can be used for money laundering. In the U.S., states are wrestling with how digital-currency businesses could be regulated as money transmitters, while Russia has said Bitcoin is illegal under current law and Finland plans to treat it as a commodity.



The Japanese banking law doesn’t allow lenders to broker Bitcoin transactions or set up accounts for customers to store the digital assets, according to the statement. At the same time, current rules don’t prevent brokerages and asset managers from managing clients’ Bitcoins, it said.



“Japan’s government is falling behind the curve as Bitcoin grew rapidly over the past five years,” said Weizhou Yang, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Banks shouldn’t take risks to dabble in Bitcoin business. On the other hand, getting Bitcoin into funds may broaden the investment product base.”

DPJ’s Okubo



Democratic Party of Japan lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo, a former vice finance minister, called on the government to rectify the lack of regulation last week. Officials from the Finance Ministry, Financial Services Agency and Bank of Japan have said they’re not in a position to oversee Bitcoin.



“The authorities’ stance that they don’t have responsibility is disgraceful,” Okubo, who also used to work at Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview on Feb. 26. “We need to establish a legal system.”



Finance Minister Taro Aso said today that the government hasn’t decided whether to regulate Bitcoin. Earlier this week Aso, who also oversees the banking regulator, said it wasn’t clear yet whether Mt. Gox’s failure was a crime.



Singapore’s finance minister said last month that the central bank didn’t recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. China has stopped financial institutions from dealing in it, even as trading continues. Danish regulators are drafting a proposal for lawmakers in an effort to protect consumers and businesses from losses.

The answer to my question is yes, no, don't know, and it depends (dependent on what country you are in).



Newsweek Unmasks Bitcoin Inventor



Two day ago, Newsweek unmasked Satoshi Nakamoto, The Face Behind Bitcoin. It's a fascinating article, and one well worth a look.



Here's a paragraph that caught my attention.

Andresen, a Silicon Valley refugee in Amherst, Mass., says he worked closely with the person "or entity" known as Satoshi Nakamoto on the development of Bitcoin from June 2010 to April 2011. This was before the rise of today's multibillion-dollar Bitcoin economy, boosted last year by the unexpected, if cautious, endorsement of outgoing Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke, who said virtual currencies "may hold long-term promise."



Since then, Bitcoin ATMs have been cropping up across North America (with some of the first in Vancouver, British Columbia; Boston; and Albuquerque, N.M.) while the acceptance of Bitcoin has spread to businesses as diverse as Tesla, OkCupid, Reddit, Overstock.com and Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's aviation company, which has said it will blast people into space if they cough up enough Bitcoin.

Denial, Bizarre Media Road Chase



The Guardian reports Satoshi Nakamoto: man denies being bitcoin inventor amid media frenzy.

Dorian S Nakamoto, the Japanese-American man named as bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, has denied any link to the digital currency amid a farcical media chase through Los Angeles.



Nakamoto, 64, disputed a Newsweek cover story that on Thursday unmasked him as the “father of bitcoin”. His denial cast doubt on a putative scoop the magazine used to relaunch its print edition.



Nakamoto made the denial in an interview with the Associated Press after a day of near-slapstick scenes in which dozens of journalists pursued him and an AP reporter through the city, provoking a social media storm. “I got nothing to do with it,” he said.



A media posse continued seeking Nakamoto on Thursday night after he left the AP office in downtown LA where he and the reporter had sought refuge earlier in the day.



The Newsweek story, written by Leah McGrath Goodman, named him as “the mystery man behind the crypto-currency” which exploded in popularity in 2013 and supposedly made its founder worth $400m.



Satoshi Nakamoto, a name attributed to the currency’s founder, was widely deemed a pseudonym for an elusive, genius hacker. Numerous media organisations tried and failed to find him.



Newsweek, a venerable but struggling brand that had dropped its print edition in 2012, returned to newsstands this week trumpeting its 4,500-word story under the headline “Bitcoin’s Face”.



Within hours of publication dozens of journalists camped outside Nakamoto’s door, ringing the bell with no response, until their silver-haired, bespectacled quarry, dressed in a grey sports coat and striped shirt, emerged and said he wanted someone who spoke Japanese and would buy him lunch.



“I’m not involved in bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free lunch first. I’m going with this guy,” Nakamoto said, pointing at an AP reporter. “I’m not in bitcoin, I don’t know anything about it.”



Cameras followed as the pair headed in a Prius to a sushi restaurant. When reporters intruded they left and drove downtown, the pursuers tweeting all the way and making comparisons to the OJ Simpson highway chase in 1994.



The pair took refuge in the news agency’s downtown headquarters, leaving a media mob outside. In AP’s report, published late on Thursday, the alleged currency mastermind said his English was imperfect and that the Newsweek reporter misinterpreted him when he said was “no longer involved in that”.



“I’m saying I’m no longer in engineering. That’s it,” he said of the exchange. “And even if I was, when we get hired you have to sign this document, contract, saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that’s what I implied. It sounded like I was involved before with bitcoin and looked like I’m not involved now. That’s not what I meant. I want to clarify that,” he said.



McGrath Goodman, who spent two months researching the story, responded that she stood by her version of the exchange on his doorstep. “There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation – and his acknowledgment of his involvement in bitcoin.”

Followup Statement



Newsweek issued a followup statement in regards to the denials ... "Newsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article. Ms. Goodman’s reporting was motivated by a search for the truth surrounding a major business story, absent any other agenda. The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto’s role in the founding of Bitcoin."



I believe Newsweek has it correct. Leah McGrath Goodman did a fantsatic job of investigative reporting.

The result could upend the French mobile sector by reducing the number of operators and ending the fierce competition that has brought considerable drops in prices to consumers.

Cable operator Numericable and the construction and telecoms group Bouygues have both offered more than 10 billion euros ($14 billion) for SFR, which boasts the country's second-largest mobile network and also provides home phone and computer services.

To sway opinion, Numericable's parent company Altice on Tuesday pledged to protect jobs and step up investments, while it turned up pressure by saying its offer would remain on the table only until Friday.

Altice has offered 10.9 billion euros and a 32 percent stake in the new company Numericable-SFR to Vivendi, which has signalled its interest in unloading SFR to focus on its media holdings that include Universal Music.

The company has said it is "convinced that its offer is the most attractive" for Vivendi as well as the entire telecommunications sector.

Numericable does not have a mobile network, so its merger with SFR would leave the sector with four operators.

Altice said its offer would also be best for accelerating development of France's fibre-optic and high-speed 4G mobile networks.

Bouygues Telecom's offer is similar in financial terms: 10.5 billion euros but 46 percent of the new company.

However it has scored political points by making commitments to not only guarantee jobs, but also bring back some of the client service jobs that had been outsourced abroad.

Low prices 'irreversible right'



But its success would result in a reduction from four to three operators, an eventuality that has worried consumers, who have seen mobile prices drop by nearly a third since a fourth network began operating in 2011.

"Going from four to three operators is something which could worry us if no guarantees are put in place," the head of the consumer protection group UFC Que Choisir, Alan Bazot, has told AFP.

Bouygues Telecom has sought to take the sting out by offering to sell its current network infrastructure to Free, the newest operator which is still struggling to build its own network.

The head of France's competition authority, Bruno Lasserre, has said that the offer increases the chances that a merger between Bouygues Telecom and SFR would receive regulatory approval.

Free, which still rents capacity from the leading network Orange but must soon give up this arrangement, has endorsed a Bouygues-SFR tie-up.

The government's industrial redevelopment minister, Arnaud Montebourg, has tried to calm consumers' concerns.

"The time has come for a renaissance in the telecoms sector. I don't believe this will be to the detriment of consumers," he said on RTL radio, saying the drop in prices for mobile calls is an "irreversible right".

Analysts tend to favour the Bouygues tie-up, which would temper the price competition that has eroded profits and reduced funds available for investments.

"It seems to us that there are more synergies between SFR and Bouygues than SFR and Numericable," said one Paris-based analyst.

But a bidding war could get out of hand, the analyst warned.

"Bouygues and Numericable both need this deal and could be led into making an offer that is too high."

Bouygues shares were down 0.26 percent on Tuesday to 32.60 euros, but have climbed by nearly 14 percent since the beginning of the month.

Numericable's share price fell 2.85 percent Tuesday to 24.19 euros, and has dropped by about a fifth since the beginning of the month.###1058||Metro-North worker dies after being hit by train while working on tracks in East Harlem

The employee was struck by the Hudson line train en-route to Poughkeepsie just before 1 a.m.



Worker was on the tracks at Park Avenue and East 106th Street in East Harlem

Man was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was later pronounced dead



New York's Metro-North Railroad says one of its employees was struck and killed by a train while working on tracks in Manhattan.

The nation's second-busiest railroad says it happened at 12:54 a.m. Monday at Park Avenue and East 106th Street.

The employee was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. His identity wasn't released.

Dead: A Metro-North employee was struck and killed by a train in Manhattan while doing work on the tracks Monday morning, MTA officials confirmed

About 50 passengers were aboard the train, the 12:47 a.m. from Grand Central Terminal bound for Poughkeepsie.

Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the 50 passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train resuming their trip at 2:17 a.m.

The death is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police.

Service was restored before the morning rush.

Timeline: The Hudson Line train departed Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m. en route to Poughkeepsie. Approximately 50 passengers on the train were safely moved to another train and resumed their trip at 2:17 a.m.

Metro-North serves 281,000 riders a day in New York and Connecticut.

It has experienced a spate of problems in the last year, including a derailment in the Bronx that killed four passengers and injured 71.

Last May, a derailment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, injured 76.

In the same month, track foreman Robert Luden, 52, was killed in Connecticut after a student rail controller put the track where Luden was working back into service without approval.

###1059||Empty###1060||An independent Scotland would need to ensure a formal currency union arrangement to keep the pound was completely viable, like being pregnant, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned.

The central bank chief made the unusual comparison speaking before the Treasury select committee about the implications of Scottish independence and potential risks if voters choose to break away from the UK in September's referendum.

"Viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant in the sense that you can't be half viable in a currency union. You need all the components of a currency union. You have to look at the whole package," he told MPs.

Carney argued that there would be "advantages" to an independent Scotland if it became part of a EU banking union but it would be "half-viable" as it would not have a common deposit guarantee scheme and lender of last resort negotiations would have to be made.

This comes after Carney warned in a speech made in Scotland that a "successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty", while the British government argued that an independent Scotland would be handing over control of its interest rates and borrowing levels to a foreign nation.

However Carney warned that the Scottish economy is "more volatile" and that there was a "distinct possibility" that banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland would be forced to move their headquarters out of an independent Scotland.

Carney suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis.

He told MPs: "There's famously a no-bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but when push came to shove with risks in the periphery that was not fully credible because the spillover effects of not bailing out, or not assisting in some sort of arrangement, were judged, in the teeth of a global crisis, to be too great to risk and so there were extraordinary efforts made, and appropriate efforts, made by European officials to avoid that.

"The issue for the rest of the UK would be would it be credible, I'm not predicting this but one has to plan for contingencies, would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?

"If it is not credible then the structure of the currency union obviously is less than perfect but it is also taking on a contingent liability or responsibility to the rest of the UK balance sheet. So, these are all issues that have to be thought through in advance."

The Bank of England governor confirmed to SNP committee member Stewart Hosie that Scotland and the rest of the UK's economies are "highly correlated", which is "beneficial" for a currency union arrangement.

Carney dismissed suggestions that he thought a currency union was a bad idea.

"I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments," he said.

"At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate. When it was suggested that he had created a "less than optimistic picture", he told MPs his intention was to draw attention to the underlying economic issues.

A fierce argument has erupted over the prospects of an independent Scotland keeping the pound in a currency union arrangement with the rest of the UK after three main political parties said that it would not be possible.

Chancellor George Osborne ruled out any chance of an independent Scotland joining a formal currency union, in a move which was backed by Labour and the Lib Dems.

Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon dismissed the warnings as the "Westminster establishment" trying to lay down the law to Scotland and warned the move would backfire on the pro-Union parties.

Osborne said: "The pound is one of the oldest and most successful currencies in the world. I want Scotland to keep the pound and the economic security that it brings,"

"The UK works, in good times and also in bad. Together we have faced the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression.

"But we avoided the economic collapse other nations around us in Europe faced because together, we had the strength to confront our problems and overcome them."

Carney told the Treasury select committee earlier today that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.###1061||Lake Effect's Mitch Teich speaks with Dr. Chukuka Enwemeka.

The rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been beset by difficulties at a number of levels, from the website troubles as health exchanges were launched last year, to the news yesterday that only about half of uninsured adults (approximately 4.5 million adults, the population of Spain) have even investigated getting insurance through health exchanges.

And in the middle of all of this is the insurance industry, which is now being told to do much of its business in a new way. For a second straight year, the UW-Milwaukee College of Health Sciences is convening a leadership healthcare forum to discuss healthcare reform, this year with an emphasis on the insurance industry.

Dr. Chukuka Enwemeka, the dean of the College of Health Sciences, hopes the forum will educate those involved in the health insurance industry what they should be doing in within the Affordable Care Act. He says many people involved are misinformed.

Enwemeka considers this process as “teething pains” for the government. Congress was hesitant in passing this act because they were entering into uncharted waters.

Enwemeka says that while the act's goal is to make sure everyone has health insurance and to make it easy to find health insurance, those who already have health insurance are not necessarily using it because of high co-pays. He hopes the forum will encourage people to look into health care rather than turn away.

“Everyone will influence how things will evolve,” Enwemeka says.

The college’s annual leadership healthcare forum is on Wednesday March 12th at the Italian Conference Center in Milwaukee.###1062||Inflation slowed to just 1.1 percent annually in February, according to the Consumer Price Index published Tuesday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Core inflation, which factors out increases in food and energy prices and is generally less volatile, was higher, at 1.6 percent.

Headline inflation, at 1.1 percent, was slower than December's 1.5 percent and January's 1.6 percent.

Food prices rose 0.4 percent in February, accounting for more than half of the overall price level rise in February, according to the BLS.

At just above 1 percent, inflation, as measured by the CPI, is roughly half of the 2-percent goal that the Federal Reserve has adopted.

Although some investors and Fed analysts have suggested that recent months' data show labor markets tightening, inflation remains below where Fed officials expect it would be in the case of a strengthening economy.

Fed officials, meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington to discuss the central bank's monetary policy, have said it "likely will be appropriate" to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate, which is currently 6.7 percent, falls well below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent target.

Other measures of inflation the Fed monitors tell a similar story — that prices are rising only slowly.

For instance, the personal consumption expenditures chain price index, taken from a different survey than the CPI, also showed core inflation low in January, at just 1.1 percent. The Fed views core PCE inflation as more informative about the underlying trend of inflation than other gauges.

With inflation slowing, rather than picking up, the Fed is less likely to take steps to retreat from its efforts to ease the money supply and signal earlier interest rate hikes.###1063||A Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train early Monday morning while working on the tracks, according to report from CBS.

Disruptions were caused for about two hours, but service has since been restored, the report said.

The president's former lawyer on Friday made his first on-camera remarks since pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and saying he broke these laws at Trump's direction. His message? Vote against Republicans, and his former boss, in the midterm elections. Cohen told CNN that Americans should get to the polls this November, because "if not, you are going to have another two or another six years of this craziness."

Cohen changed his party registration from Republican to Democrat last week, just a few months after he left his post as the deputy finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. At the time, Cohen's lawyer said this was another example of him "distancing himself from the values" of the White House, and from the man who retained his legal services for 12 years. On Friday, Cohen said that he has really always been a Democrat at heart, and only briefly changed his party registration to Republican so he could work for the RNC.

CNN also reports that Cohen is prepared to stump for Democrats this November and in 2020 — although, considering Cohen will be sentenced on eight criminal charges this December, it seems unlikely anyone will take him up on that offer.

Though American Eagle had a better-than-expected fiscal third quarter with a 5.6% increase in revenue from third quarter 2012, the retailer expects a 7% decline in sales from the previous year during the holiday season according to a business report provided by the company in January.

Many retailers suffered during the holiday season slump which saw consumer foot traffic down 17.7% in December compared to last year despite industry wide promotional discounting.

The sudden departure of American Eagle CEO Robert Hanson in January along with the bleak earnings report hasnt helped shore up confidence in the company whose EPS is down 53% to $0.26 according to Yahoo! Finance.

"We rate AMERN EAGLE OUTFITTERS INC (AEO) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its reasonable valuation levels and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income, poor profit margins and weak operating cash flow."

New Delhi, Mon, 17 Mar 2014 ANI

New Delhi, Mar. 17 (ANI): An Indian Navy ship involved in search operations for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane on Monday arrived at the naval base in Port Blair.

India on Sunday had put on hold its search for the missing aircraft, at the request of the Malaysian government, which wants to reassess the week-old hunt for the Boeing 777 that is suspected of being deliberately flown off course

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

Malaysia briefed envoys from nearly two dozen nations and appealed for international help in the search for the plane along two arcs stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the far south of the Indian Ocean.

India had initially been combing two areas-one around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and a second, further west, in the Bay of Bengal.

Both operations have been suspended, but may yet resume, Indian defence officials said.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage hardened further after it was confirmed the last radio message from the cockpit - an informal "all right, good night" - was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

But police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened aboard the jetliner unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to the borders of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

The controversy marks a major test of Carney’s leadership after he took over the BoE less than a year ago and began overhauling its monetary policy, communications regime and structure. Market prices are driven by a combination of fundamental data and sentiment and from a sentiment point of view; this probably won’t bode well for the pound.

Sterling came under pressure yesterday afternoon as Charlie Bean, the deputy governor for monetary policy warned that a further rise in the pound would hinder efforts to boost exports and rebalance the economy. His comments will dampen expectations of a rate hike any time soon and that will have a negative impact on the pound. According to Mr. Bean the BoE will first need to see sustainable growth before they change monetary policy i.e. a pickup in business investment, an improvement in productivity and an increase in exports.

European officials started preparing sanctions against Russia yesterday as diplomats acknowledged their efforts had failed to persuade Russia to stand down in the Ukraine. At this stage it’s difficult to understand what kind of affect the sanctions will have on trade and the currency but we can certainly expect some volatility in weeks to come.

Remember a number of EU member states have become dependent on Russian gas and money. Russia supplies 40% of German gas imports and almost 5% of German manufacturing exports go to Russia. Trade sanctions if imposed by Europe could have a negative impact on the euro. The Europeans are on their own here, after 4 years of austerity the British economy is simply too frail to take a principled stand against armed aggression.

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, confirmed yesterday that the Fed will continue to taper at its present rate of $10Bn a month. At this point, the Fed is still trying to determine whether the economy is showing signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or because of fundamental obstacles to growth.

More than likely it’s the weather which means that this could be a good time to buy dollars. The outlook for the economy still looks favourable, unemployment is high but it’s coming down, the budget deficit is declining, the housing market is showing signs of improvement and interest rates are still low which is great for stimulation. According to the White House, the US economy is expected to expand by 3.1% this year and by 3.4% in 2015.###1071||Empty###1072||The search for the missing plane has continued over the Andaman Islands [GETTY/AP]

India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea

Sources have confirmed that sabotage is a real possibility with military-radar tracking evidence suggesting Flight MH370 could have been flown hundreds of miles off course towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, north-west of Malaysia. A senior Malaysian police official said inquiries were focusing increasingly on the theory that someone who knew how to fly a plane deliberately diverted the Boeing 777, with 239 people on board, off its intended course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A U.S official in Washington said that investigators are examining the possibility of "human intervention" in the plane's disappearance, adding it may have been "an act of piracy." The official, who wasn't authorised to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, also said it was possible the plane may have landed somewhere. India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea as search efforts continue to expand. Two Indian air force reconnaissance planes flew over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after they and two naval ships and two coast guard vessels scoured the surrounding seas without finding evidence of the plane. A spokesman declined to give details about the rest of the search operation, including the use of technologies such as the heat sensors aboard the Dornier planes. The Andaman and Nicobar archipelago stretches south of Myanmar and contains 572 islands covering an area of 447-by-32 miles. Only 37 are inhabited, with the rest covered in dense forests.

As the search for the missing plane entered its seventh day, a senior Malaysian police official said: "What we can say is we are looking at sabotage, with hijack still on the cards." Two sources said an unidentified aircraft believed to be Flight MH370 was following a route between navigational waypoints - indicating it was being flown by someone with aviation training - when it was last plotted on military radar off Malaysia’s northwest coast. The position suggested the plane was flying toward India's Andaman Islands, which lie between the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. That would mean it flew for up to five hours after the last contact and officials are now likely to have to dramatically extend the current 27,000sq nautical mile search area out into the vast Indian Ocean. Malaysian police have previously said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. The comments by the three sources are the first clear indication that foul play is the main focus of official suspicions in the Boeing 777's disappearance. Earlier reports that two passengers boarded the plane with stolen passports sparked speculation the plane could have been hijacked by terrorists, but the theory weakened after Malaysian authorities determined that one of them was an Iranian seeking asylum in Europe. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said: "We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group.” Speaking at a press conference this morning, the country’s transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said they were looking into the possibilty one of the pilots may have been involved. He also said the plane’s tracking systems could have been turned off by someone intentionally, or under duress. In the week that the plane has been missing, several other theories have been put forward.

The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were “Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace. Retired British Airways pilot Alastair Rosenschein believes Flight MH 370 has plunged into the Indian Ocean half way between Madagascar and Australia. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he claimed the Malaysian jetliner is around 5,000 miles away from where rescuers are looking in the South China Sea after flying on a course set by the pilots before the crew passed out from a drop in cabin pressure. He said: "The initial reaction for pilots in that case would be to put on oxygen masks immediately. "However, had they failed to do that the next option would be to turn off the airway in order to do a rapid descent. "Without the oxygen masks they would have passed out within a few seconds. "That would have left the aircraft on autopilot heading in whichever direction they had turned the aircraft on the autopilot. "I'm suggesting that they would have made that initial heading a reciprocal one back towards Kuala Lumpur airport. "That doesn't mean they turned the aircraft directly and exactly toward Kuala Lumpur airport it could quite happily have been a parallel track with the airway.

"With the fuel on board that would put the aircraft finally as it ran out out of fuel, with everybody unconscious on board, somewhere around the mid-Indian Ocean which is thousands of miles away from where they're looking at present. "The worst case scenario for the location of the aircraft would be half-way between Madagascar and Australia, a very very difficult area to search and of course a huge area." Satellite images released by Chinese authorities earlier this week appeared to show the outline of a plane's wreckage floating in between the Gulf of Thailand the South China Sea. But Malaysia's transport minister said the pictures do not show the wreckage of the missing aircraft and were released by mistake and a Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency surveillance plan had been dispatched to the area and had found nothing. Mr Hussein also dismissed a report by the Wall Street Journal that MH 370 kept flying for several hours after it lost contact, claiming teams from Boeing and Rolls Royce confirmed engine data cited in the article was inaccurate.

He added that all the necessary pre-flight checks and maintenance work had been carried out on the plane and dispelled rumours police have searched the homes of the pilots. Some 57 ships and 48 aircraft from 13 countries are now taking part in the operation, which covers 27,000 square nautical miles from the South China Sea to India's territorial waters. Satellite pictures of the Gulf of Thailand have now been uploaded to the web and members of the public are being urged to help the search from home. Colorado based company DigitalGlobe have uploaded the images to tomnod.com and are asking volunteers to point out “anything that looks interesting, any signs of wreckage or life rafts." Several witnesses have come forward, claiming to have spotted the plane. New Zealand worker Mike McKay claimed to have witnessed the Malaysia Airlines plane "come down" in flames. Speaking to ABC News, he said: "I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right. "I observed (the plane) burning at high altitude. "While I observed the burning (plane) it appeared to be in one piece."

Indonesia and Thailand, which lie on either side of the northern part of the Malacca Strait, have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace. A senior military officer who had been briefed on the investigation said the missing aircraft had made a detour to the west after communications with civilian authorities ended. "It changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude. It made it into the Malacca Strait," the officer said. A non-military source familiar with the investigations said the reported detour was one of several theories and was being checked. If the plane had made such a detour it would undermine the theory that it suffered a sudden, catastrophic mechanical failure, as it would mean it flew at least 350 miles after its last contact with air traffic control. In the absence of any concrete evidence to explain the plane's disappearance, authorities have not ruled out anything. Witnesses have come forward, claiming to have spotted the plane. Mike McKay, a New Zealander working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Thailand, sent an email Vietnamese authorities saying he spotted what could have been a burning plane 200 miles southeast of Vung Tau. Police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were “Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace. Another possibility being looked into by authorities is that one of the pilots committed suicide. John Brennan, head of the US Central Intelligence Agency said: “I think you cannot discount any theory.”

Malaysia's transport minister said everything was being done to find the plane [AP]###1073||Stock exchange chief Charles Li Xiaojia says the city must be ready to reform its share-listing rules if it wants to stay a globally competitive financial centre, but it was right to stick to principles that saw it lose out yesterday to New York for the potential HK$100 billion listing of Alibaba.

Li spoke to the South China Morning Post hours after mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba said it had picked New York after months of wrangling with Hong Kong regulators over its management structure that the Securities and Futures Commission said breached its "one shareholder, one vote" governance rules.

"Everything has a cost. Our persistence has a cost too," Li told the Post, but added that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing would continue with the review of its existing listing rules - which began after a stalemate with Alibaba last autumn - even though the deal was now dead.

We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant

Charles Li Xiaojia

"The reform review in the HKEx will not stop because Alibaba has decided to list elsewhere," Li said. "We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant, but Alibaba's proposal has propelled the management to review our operating model. The eventual loss may be even larger if we don't undergo reforms [of the] listing regime."

However, the stock exchange chief was careful to back regulation that many international investors - and the SFC - say define Hong Kong as a respected market in which to trade and invest.

"We feel proud of Hong Kong as we ensure that our rule of law and investor protection remain intact," Li said.

Hangzhou -based Alibaba, led by former English teacher Jack Ma Yun, said yesterday that it would begin the process for an initial public offering in New York.

Hong Kong's regulators had rejected Alibaba's wish for an amendment to the city's listing rules to accommodate a partnership structure that gives Ma and other senior managers the right to nominate a majority of board members, despite owning only around 10 per cent of the firm's stock. Exchanges in the US allow such dual-class structures. The other major stock holders in Alibaba are Yahoo and Softbank.

Alibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since Facebook's US$16 billion IPO in 2012.

The estimate is based on the firm's current expected market value of between US$100 billion and US$120 billion.

Alibaba said on its corporate blog yesterday that the steps towards a US IPO would make the firm "more global and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals".

Investment banks, including Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, are said by market participants to be the lead managers for the Alibaba listing.

The US listing will provide a swift means for Alibaba to lower the cost of capital since the deal-hungry internet firm has spent more than US$3 billion in a buying spree over the past year.###1074||Innovation holds key to China's economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, Premier Li Keqiang said last week in the government work report at the ongoing annual session of the country's top legislature. From high-tech products to cutting-edge scientific research and development, China's drive to shift its role from "the factory floor of the world" to an inventor and innovator has become a hot topic at home and abroad. Xinhua reporters carried out a series of interviews around the world to sketch out how the foreigners think of the the China-developed products and the related developments. DIALOGUE 1 Xinhua: Do you have anything developed and produced in China? How do you feel about them? "I don't know it was made by China," said a Californian commuter Passti, referring to the BYD E-bus she is on. "It's very comfortable, very clean and quiet, I love it ... It would be perfect if it has more space." The bus driver Derrick Smith also expressed his fondness for the bus. "I actually like driving BYD's electric buses over any gas-fueled or CNG-fueled buses. They ride a lot smoother, cleaner; they feel a lot lighter, and the driver area is more comfortable," he said. Beside electronic busses, China-designed cellphones have also edged into the Western society. "Of course I use the ZTE phones. I am proud to use it," said Nicklas Sivander, sales director of ZTE's Sweden office. "It has all the features I need ... I also control my whole home music system with this smartphone. So it's my everyday tool." DIALOGUE 2 Xinhua: What are the competitive edges and weaknesses of Chinese manufactured products compared with their international competitors? "The (Chinese) technology is very good," said Brenden Riley, sales chief of BYD's North American office. "My only concern with Chinese new tech is that I don't find the design so pretty yet, but that will come with time." Chinese-made products "need to be cooler, prettier," Riley noted. "The life cycle of high-tech products is short, so the international competition requires a different way, more localized ... I think it's coming but just not there yet." However, to Sivander, the tempting quality and price of Chinese mobiles made them successful in local market. "We have all the features that any advanced smartphone has on the market right now," he said, "The good thing with this phone is we can offer it with attractive price here in north Europe, which means that we are competing with the major player but giving more value for money." "What we need to improve our performance here is to work on our brand, to inform the consumers that ZTE exists and has designed proper products," Sivander suggested. DIALOGUE 3 Xinhua: How is Chinese scientific groups' papers publication doing, in terms of originality, forwardness and growing rate? According to data provided by Natasha D. Pinol, senior communications officer of science, almost 70 published original research papers have listed authors from China in 2010. But to 2013, the number has rocketed to 104. Dr. Nick Campbell, executive editor of Nature, also said increasing research papers from China have been published in his journals in recent years. "From 2008 to 2012 we saw the contribution from Chinese authors to papers in Nature rapidly increase to 2.5 percent in 2012 compared to 1.5 percent in 2008," he said. "Over the same period China' share of papers in all Nature journals were more than doubled, from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent." The editor told Xinhua that the Chinese Academy of Sciences has replaced the University of Tokyo in January 2013 as the largest institutional contributor to Nature in the Asia-Pacific. "All indications at this stage are that this pattern of growth has continued," said Campbell. "Our criteria for selection focus on original findings of outstanding significance that are of interest to an interdisciplinary readership... in broad terms, an improvement in the number of Chinese researchers that are meeting these exacting standards in their papers." DIALOGUE 4 Xinhua: China has made considerate investment in scientific R&D. Can you tell us how is China's research output compared with that of the West? What should be underlined in China's reform of its scientific and research system in your opinion? "Government support for science clearly helps to speed scientific advancement," said Pinol. "Adequate federal support for research and development is essential to innovation. China's leaders clearly recognize the connection between increased government support for science and the discoveries that drive economic prosperity." As for Campbell, he said research-output efficiency is not a trivial thing to measure. "We would never suggest that you should use publications in Nature journals," he said. "Nonetheless we can at least look at how countries do relative to their total number of researchers. These figures show that China's contribution to these journals is lower than smaller Asia-Pacific countries such as Australia and Singapore, and the largest global contributors to Nature journals, the USA and UK." However, the executive editor argued that there is no perfect way of organizing a research funding system. "Many nations are struggling to strike an appropriate balance bet," he said. "Like all nations, China needs to continue to focus on improvements that reward high quality research outcomes and help leverage that research to ultimately make a substantive positive impact on broader society."###1075||NEW DELHI — When Shweta Singh wanted to become a pilot in India 20 years ago, she had to first persuade her parents to let her pick an uncommon profession for women, then deal with unwelcoming male colleagues in the cockpit.

Comments from some central bankers and their advisors did give the markets a little bit of volatility yesterday.

Charlie Bean, the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, spoke yesterday to a group of business leaders in Darlington. When asked about sterling he said that “any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports”. He also said that exports have been disappointing, although it may be “only a matter of time” before trade begins to improve as those economies we enjoy significant trade ties with improve.

These comments were good enough for a good 0.5% off losses in GBPUSD and briefly pressed sterling down to below the 1.20 level in GBPEUR. There may have been some sterling selling as well ahead of Carney’s testimony in front of the Treasury Select Committee due this morning. Carney – alongside Paul Fisher, David Miles and Martin Fisher – will testify in front of MPs on the changes to forward guidance outlined in the recent Quarterly Inflation Report. However, the pointed questions will more likely revolve around accusations that the Bank of England was complicit in some form of abuse in currency markets. We would wager that this will be Carney’s most uncomfortable appearance in front of TSC.

Elsewhere, EUR was weakened following a report in the Telegraph that a German think tank is calling for a “QE-style blitz” in order to avert a slip into deflation. EURUSD peeled back from 1.39 to the mid-1.38s as Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, called for EUR60bn of bond purchases each month until the threat of deflation was taken care of. Christian Noyer, Bank of France member at the ECB, echoed sentiment that the euro was too strong at the moment but that the Eurozone did not face deflation. The calls for the ECB to make amends to its policy are increasing in volume and urgency.

A function of this is we are looking for GBPEUR to rebound from these lows through the week.

As was expected, the Bank of Japan have decided to hold policy as is this month. This will not last in our eyes and believe that Japan’s progression through 2014 will be marked by a strong stumble in growth and confidence, following the imposition of an increase in sales taxes that will kill off any recent improvements in consumer spending dynamics. Growth and spending have already been brought forward into Q1, to avoid the April 1st deadline, and then fall from a cliff afterwards. Growth yesterday morning was shown to have been around ¼ of expectations in Q4 of last year. The Bank of Japan is likely to ride into the monetary battle with further purchases of Japanese government debt and Exchange Traded Funds in order to further weaken the yen, promote liquidity and generate stock market gains. USDJPY remains 0.4% from its highs YTD.

Notably, respondents’ home price expectations climbed significantly in February—with 50 percent saying home prices will go up in the next year—following a measurable downturn in January, while the share of those who believe it is a good time to buy a home ticked up by 3 percentage points.

At the same time, those who believe that it would be easy to get a mortgage dropped 7 percentage points from January’s all-time survey high of 52 percent. Additionally, the share of respondents who say the economy is on the wrong track increased 3 percentage points to 57 percent in February, following a four-month decline. Despite a decrease in optimism across some of the indicators last month, consumer attitudes remain in generally positive ranges.

“Similar to the noisy economic and housing data published over the past few months, we’ve seen a corresponding increase in volatility in our survey results, particularly for home price expectations and perceptions about the ease of getting a mortgage,” says Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. “Weather may have played a role, as suggested by a 6 percentage point jump over the past two months in the share of consumers who say their household expenses are significantly higher than a year ago. This response would be consistent with higher home heating costs. Despite the volatile month-to-month changes, we believe that the housing recovery is continuing, but is not yet robust.”

The legislators have a total of 107 questions about the recall, which covered six models, sold from the 2003 through 2007 model years. At root is an ignition switch that can move out of its normal ‘on’ position while driving—leading to the loss of power (and steering and braking assist, in some cases) along with a risk that airbags won’t deploy in a resulting accident.

In all, the issue has been attributed in at least 31 crashes and 13 deaths, in the following models that were recalled last month:

The procedure of such a Congressional investigation was laid out by the Tread Act of 2000, which was a piece of auto-safety legislation prompted by the high-profile recall that year, of Ford Explorer SUVs equipped with Firestone tires. “The committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain on the road,” said U.S. Representative Henry Waxman, the top-ranking Democrat of the committee.

NHTSA has already opened a separate investigation into the matter—checking that GM reported the issue in what would be considered a timely manner—and GM has provided such a chronology.

GM was allegedly first aware of the issue in 2004, when it concerned a 2005 Chevy Cobalt; and according to the Wall Street Journal a GM engineer proposed a new design that could handle additional weight from a key ring (part of the issue); although the revised design was later canceled.

However as lawyers set GM in their sights, one legal issue could get in the way: Under the restructuring that occurred when the “old GM” became the “new GM,” the automaker’s product liability only extends back to July 2009; claims on issues prior to that would need to be addressed through bankruptcy court.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors are considering a criminal probe regarding the matter. And a Senate inquiry? While one hasn’t yet been initiated, that could happen in coming days.

While Mt. Gox did not provide further information about the attack, which reportedly exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, a group of hackers claimed Sunday that they broke into Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ personal blog, and found a discrepancy in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins Mt. Gox claimed were stolen in February's security lapse.

According to a report from Forbes, the hackers gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Karpeles and posted a message, claiming that the exchange still had access to some of the bitcoins that Karpeles had reported stolen.

The hackers uploaded a series of files, including a spreadsheet of anonymous user accounts with details of bitcoin balances, Karpeles' home address, and a screenshot allegedly verifying the hackers' access to the data. In addition, the hackers also posted a 716MB zip file claimed to contain stolen data from Mt. Gox servers. Here is the link to the data on Pastebin.

“First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,” the hackers wrote. “It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed… Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with f***ing Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.”

The data posted by the hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, claiming it had lost 750,000 customer bitcoins, in addition to 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.

While the authenticity of Sunday’s database dump has not yet been confirmed, some Reddit users said they had found that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, CNET reported.###1083||News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services###1084||###1085||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The search for the missing Malaysian jet pushed deep into the northern and southern hemispheres Monday as Australia took the lead in scouring the seas of the southern Indian Ocean and Kazakhstan -- about 10,000 miles to the northwest -- answered Malaysia's call for help in the unprecedented hunt.

French investigators arriving to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals -- but investigators say the Malaysian airliner's communications links were deliberately severed ahead of its mysterious disappearance more than a week ago.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.

Malaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots' home on March 9, the day after the flight.

Investigators haven't ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight's last words -- "All right, good night" -- to ground controllers.

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots -- or someone else -- without the other pilot's knowledge.

Malaysia's government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

Over the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 A1/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.

The northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan -- all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.

An official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to questions on radar information.

Indonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country's search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the "ill-fated aircraft" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia's leader.

"Australia will do its duty in this matter," Abbott told parliament. "We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."

Australia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

###1086||With less than three weeks before a looming deadline for enrolling in mandatory health coverage, the federal government has unveiled several rule changes affecting Obamacare insurers and their customers.

The changes, revealed in a flurry of announcements in recent days, will broaden the size of provider networks in some health plans next year, give insurers financial relief, affirm that certain groups will receive health benefits that were being questioned and extends temporary coverage to some people with pre-existing conditions.

Amid those announcements, The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that officials are preparing to effectively grant an extension of the March 31 deadline for Obamacare enrollment to last-minute shoppers who run into technical problems on government exchanges, and who can document those problems.

Deadline extended?

Federal officials Monday said only, "Open enrollment ends March 31," when CNBC.com asked about the Journal report.

But if officials do end up extending the deadline, it would not be surprising. In December, when dealing with large numbers of people trying to sign up for health coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2014, the government several times effectively extended the enrollment deadline, and leaned on insurers to get them to honor sign-ups that occurred after the deadline.

Under the Affordable Care Act, nearly every American must have some form of health insurance by March 31 or face a tax penalty next year.

One major change announced by the government will effectively compel insurers selling plans on the Obamacare exchanges for 2015 to increase the minimum number of so-called essential community providers in the plans' networks.

According to the Reuters poll, more than half (32 out of 63) of the economists surveyed believed that the Fed would increase short-term rates in the June or September quarters of 2015, while 14 of 63 believed the rate increase could happen before the second half of next year. Only six economists forecasted a later rate increase than quarter three 2015. Only two out of the three number-crunchers gave a general prediction of 2015.

The Fed has kept short-term interest rates low, or at near-zero levels since December 2008, pursuant to stimulating the U.S. economy, and has maintained this so-called “ultra-easy” monetary policy since then, as the economy recovered from the doldrums of 2008.

Speaking in general, the economists surveyed said that the U.S. unemployment rates may go below 6 percent sometime next year, particularly in the second half, hence necessitating an increase in rates and a change in policy. “You are looking at an unemployment rate that probably gets below 6 percent by the second half of 2015 and that’s within a hair’s breath of full employment,” said Bank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson. “It will start to push up wage growth by that period.” Conversely, Moody’s Analytics senior economist Ryan Sweet posited that the Fed may “start to raise interest rates sooner than the markets expect.”

The Reuters survey generated a average forecast of 6.4 percent for the unemployment rate in 2014. This may be indicative of this key statistic crossing the 6.5 percent threshold that central bank policymakers have set as a trigger for potential interest rate increases from near-zero levels. For 2015, the economists believe that the jobless rate could reach 5.9 percent. The metric was at 6.6 percent in January 2014, but had ticked up slightly to 6.7 percent as of last month’s reading; with unemployment figures trending downwards, the Fed has since decided to start tapering, or cutting back on its asset purchases, and is now making these purchases to the tune of $65 billion per month. A similar $10 billion taper is expected to be confirmed at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which takes place from March 18 through 19.

In other key takeaways from the survey, the economists forecasted faster wage growth, what with drag in the employment market substantially less evident than it was before. Nonfarm payrolls may average about 200,000 new jobs created per month in the June ending quarter of 2014, following laggard job creation in the March quarter. Employment stats in the March frame, among other figures, are believed by experts to be skewered due to unusually harsh weather in the winter months.

Additionally, the economists opined that the increase in wages pertained to above may not result in an increase in inflation, as slower growth rates in emerging countries may serve as the proverbial albatross preventing commodity price growth. Another variable that may keep inflation from building up, according to the survey, is a stronger greenback in relation to world currencies.###1088||Empty###1089||Empty###1090||Empty###1091||Tripoli, Libya: Libya’s parliament has ousted the nation’s prime minister in a vote of confidence.

JCP "is early in this go-forward phase but we like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014," Chen wrote.

JCP shares were up 8.6% at $9.21 each in recent trade, climbing to an intra-day high of $9.28 a share and, at least temporarily, erasing the stock's year-to-date drop in its share price.

BOSTON (MarketWatch) — The U.S. economy’s recovery and subsequent expansion since 2008 has been painfully slow, but appears to be gaining traction. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy should reflect this reality. Interest rates cannot stay low forever, and central bank balance sheets should not grow to the sky.

According to the most recent data available, economic activity remains subpar, but 2.5% real GDP and 6.7% unemployment with 1.6% core inflation is hardly a crisis state. At some point, continuing the Fed’s extraordinary quantitative easing measures indicate that the underlying economy is not healthy, creating more uncertainty for investors, businesses and consumers.

To counter this, the Fed should spell out what a more normalized monetary policy would look like, starting with its policy meeting this week. Here are five actions the Fed should take:

1. Continue to unhinge forward guidance from the current unemployment target

In spite of the recent blip-up in unemployment to 6.7%, this rate is dangerously close to the 6.5% mark the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has pegged as possibly warranting a move from its current level. The Fed knows that the reduction in unemployment from 10% to 6.7% is likely due in large part to changing labor force dynamics — a generational drop in the participation rate to 63%, not resurgence in true job creation. So, if 6.5% is no longer relevant, what is the new standard?

David Lafferty

2. Be more explicit about tapering guidance

The Fed has maintained that tapering is “data dependent” and not on a set path. However, this has been largely contradicted by FOMC members who believe the monthly reduction of $10 billion is a relatively set course. Further clarification will help market participants better gauge how long the Fed’s support of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities will last.

3. Continue to expand the reverse repurchase agreement program

This experimental program allows the Fed to lend securities, effectively draining liquidity from the system. This program may be well-suited for managing rates higher when the time comes, as it can more directly control short-term interest rates and is open to large non-bank financial institutions in addition to banks.

4. Consider a transition from a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) to merely a low interest rate policy

Since January 2009, the effective fed funds rate has averaged just 0.14%. Market rates have already moved up from their 2012–13 lows, so many of the positive effects from refinancing and balance sheet repair have already occurred. With the baby boomers growing as a percent of total consumption every day, it’s time for the Fed to ask if near-zero short-term yields aren’t punishing savers more than they’re helping borrowers.

Surely by late 2014 or early 2015 (post-QE), an economy growing near 3% should be able to handle an overnight rate of 0.50% to 0.75%. A modest increase in short-term rates could send a positive economic message (while helping to remove some speculative excess from the credit markets).

5. Janet Yellen should put her own stamp on monetary policy

In many ways, the Fed chairwoman’s continuation of Ben Bernanke’s policies was an important driver in her selection, but at some point Yellen must help guide the Fed away from her predecessor’s war footing.

Which policy tools does Yellen prefer? How does she balance the Fed’s dual mandate? What is her regulatory agenda? With falling unemployment, moderate inflation and improving growth, market interest rates should move gradually higher. While investors have been planning their rising rate strategy for several years, it’s time the Fed presented its plan for a post-ZIRP world.

“Meet Viktor Yanu­kovych, who is running for the presidency of Ukraine.” Vladimir Putin and I were standing in his office at the presidential dacha in late 2004 when Yanu­kovych suddenly appeared from a back room. Putin wanted me to get the point. He’s my man, Ukraine is ours — and don’t forget it.

The “Ukrainian problem” has been brewing for some time between the West and Russia. Since Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, the United States and Europe have tried to convince Russia that the vast territory should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation that could chart its own course. Putin has never seen it that way. For him, Kiev’s movement toward the West is an affront to Russia in a zero-sum game for the loyalty of former territories of the empire. The invasion and possible annexation of Crimea on trumped-up concerns for its Russian-speaking population is his answer to us.

The immediate concern must be to show Russia that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Diplomatic isolation, asset freezes and travel bans against oligarchs are appropriate. The announcement of air defense exercises with the Baltic states and the movement of a U.S. destroyer to the Black Sea bolster our allies, as does economic help for Ukraine’s embattled leaders, who must put aside their internal divisions and govern their country.

The longer-term task is to answer Putin’s statement about Europe’s post-Cold War future. He is saying that Ukraine will never be free to make its own choices — a message meant to reverberate in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states — and that Russia has special interests it will pursue at all costs. For Putin, the Cold War ended “tragically.” He will turn the clock back as far as intimidation through military power, economic leverage and Western inaction will allow.

After Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, the United States sent ships into the Black Sea, airlifted Georgian military forces from Iraq back to their home bases and sent humanitarian aid. Russia was denied its ultimate goal of overthrowing the democratically elected government, an admission made to me by the Russian foreign minister. The United States and Europe could agree on only a few actions to isolate Russia politically.

But even those modest steps did not hold. Despite Russia’s continued occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the diplomatic isolation waned and then the Obama administration’s “reset” led to an abrupt revision of plans to deploy missile defense components in the Czech Republic and Poland. Talk of Ukraine and Georgia’s future in NATO ceased. Moscow cheered.

This time has to be different. Putin is playing for the long haul, cleverly exploiting every opening he sees. So must we, practicing strategic patience if he is to be stopped. Moscow is not immune from pressure. This is not 1968, and Russia is not the Soviet Union. The Russians need foreign investment; oligarchs like traveling to Paris and London, and there are plenty of ill-gotten gains stored in bank accounts abroad; the syndicate that runs Russia cannot tolerate lower oil prices; neither can the Kremlin’s budget, which sustains subsidies toward constituencies that support Putin. Soon, North America’s bounty of oil and gas will swamp Moscow’s capacity. Authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline and championing natural gas exports would signal that we intend to do precisely that. And Europe should finally diversify its energy supply and develop pipelines that do not run through Russia.

Many of Russia’s most productive people, particularly its well-educated youth, are alienated from the Kremlin. They know that their country should not be only an extractive industries giant. They want political and economic freedoms and the ability to innovate and create in today’s knowledge-based economy. We should reach out to Russian youth, especially students and young professionals, many of whom are studying in U.S. universities and working in Western firms. Democratic forces in Russia need to hear American support for their ambitions. They, not Putin, are Russia’s future.

Most important, the United States must restore its standing in the international community, which has been eroded by too many extended hands of friendship to our adversaries, sometimes at the expense of our friends. Continued inaction in Syria, which has strengthened Moscow’s hand in the Middle East, and signs that we are desperate for a nuclear agreement with Iran cannot be separated from Putin’s recent actions. Radically declining U.S. defense budgets signal that we no longer have the will or intention to sustain global order, as does talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan whether the security situation warrants it or not. We must not fail, as we did in Iraq, to leave behind a residual presence. Anything less than the American military’s requirement for 10,000 troops will say that we are not serious about helping to stabilize that country.

The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous “norms of the international community.” Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as al-Qaeda reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.

These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular U.S. foreign policy: Countries are not trying to “balance” American power. They have come due to signals that we are exhausted and disinterested. The events in Ukraine should be a wake-up call to those on both sides of the aisle who believe that the United States should eschew the responsibilities of leadership. If it is not heeded, dictators and extremists across the globe will be emboldened. And we will pay a price as our interests and our values are trampled in their wake.###1107||American Airlines said Monday the JetBlue Airways relationship was no longer necessary, leading it to break off the interline arrangement."Through the merger with US Airways, American’s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and as a result, there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement," spokesman Casey Norton said.JetBlue Airways said it was American Airlines' idea to break up their partnership."Not surprisingly, we were advised last week that American Airlines is going to break-off the interline relationship that we have had in place with American Airlines," JetBlue CEO Dave Barger told participants in a J.P. Morgan conference Monday in New York." Not surprising, when we consider what transpired with the recent integration with U.S. Airways. And as we look at the partnership which we were very pleased with, it’s unfortunate. We’re in the process of advising customers," Barger said.But the end of the relationship "is not overly meaningful when we think our material, when we think about the other partnerships that we have wrapped around it," Barger said.At one time, many believed that American Airlines and JetBlue would tighten their loose marketing arrangement, and some speculated that the two might eventually merger. American coveted the huge numbers of passengers that JetBlue carried into and out of New York Kennedy.But that was before American merged with US Airways, and American’s management changed significantly.For whatever reasons, JetBlue and American announced Monday they were ending their interline agreement in which the two would exchange passengers at JFK and Boston. You won't be able to buy a single ticket that combines the flights of both carriers.In their somewhat terse releases, the carriers stated:

American Airlines and JetBlue Airways plan to terminate their interline traffic agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program accrual agreement, which includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).

Beginning today, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier. Effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline.

All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and are not affected. The two airlines are working together to ensure these changes have little impact to customers.

Analyst Helane Becker of Cowen & Co. suggested that the split would be "more negative" for JetBlue than for American, which is picking up eastern passengers through its Dec. 9 merger with US Airways."This is not a complete surprise as we expected US Airways could provide American the feed they need in New York," Becker wrote in a research note Monday. "More to the point, we expect New York to be less important to American going forward as US Airways has a large hub in Philadelphia.'###1108||Thanks for stopping by.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir (LUXEMBOURG - Tags: BUSINESS POLITICS) Picture taken on November 20, 2012.

London - Vodafone has agreed to buy Spain's largest cable operator Ono for 7.2 billion euros (R107 billion), in the latest move by the British group to acquire fixed-line assets to rebuild its European operations. Vodafone said on Monday it expected to achieve cost and capital expenditure savings of approximately 240 million euros, before integration costs, by the fourth full year after completion.

The deal for the private equity-owned group is Vodafone's third purchase of a European fixed-broadband asset in two years as the company seeks to improve its networks and shore up its European businesses after they were hit by fierce competition, the recession and regulatory cuts.

Vodafone has launched a programme to invest in its networks, and acquire assets where necessary, after selling its US arm for $130 billion last year.

A 7.2 billion-euro price tag implies a multiple of 10.4 times the group's operating free cash flow, broadly in line with recent deals in the European cable and telecoms sector.

“The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone,” Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said. - Reuters###1111||We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audience is coming from.

"Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt," Mr Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to the east.

Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.

"The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union," Mr Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the Nato defence alliance.

The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Ms Merkel's Wednesday visit.

"I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole," he said.

"I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money," Mr Tusk said. "This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon," he added.

Mr Tusk said talks with Ms Merkel would also focus on "how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance".

Washington on Friday played down the risk posed to the European economy by Russia's threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, insisting the region had adequate stocks.

Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev.###1114||Empty###1115||Get ready for Janet Yellen's first policymaking meeting as head of the Federal Reserve.

The Fed is set to meet this Tuesday and Wednesday to mull over the latest economic data, issue new forecasts and re-evaluate its plan for winding down its stimulus program. Here are the top things to look for:

1) Tapering will continue: The central bank has been buying trillions in bonds since late 2008 in an effort to lower long-term interest rates. The goal: Stimulate the economy by making it cheaper to take out loans.

Bur the Fed has determined it's time to start winding down that stimulus program. Since December, the central bank has been slowly reducing its bond purchases at each meeting, in a process Wall Street has dubbed "tapering." The Fed was previously buying $85 billion in bonds each month, then reduced the amount to $75 billion in January, and then $65 billion in February.

Economists expect a similar reduction in bond purchases will be announced at the upcoming meeting, especially given Yellen's comments before a Congressional committee last month. "We expect to continue reducing the pace of purchases in measured steps," she said.

2) The goalposts will change: The Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since 2008, also as a way to stimulate more spending.

Investors have become accustomed to low interest rates but are looking for signals about when the Fed might eventually raise rates as the economy strengthens.

So far, the Fed has said it wants to see the unemployment rate fall to around 6.5%, or inflation rise as high as 2.5%, before it will be ready to raise rates. But here's the problem: The unemployment rate, at 6.7% in February, is already nearing that point, and Yellen still thinks the economy is too weak.

She may want to abandon the numerical targets altogether and focus on qualitative information instead.

The unemployment rate alone is "not a sufficient statistic to measure the health of the labor market," she told Senators last month.

Meanwhile, New York Fed President Bill Dudley has said the 6.5% unemployment rate "is already obsolete." It's a "reasonable time to revamp" the Fed statement to take out that threshold, he said at a Wall Street Journal event last week.

3) Weather puts the Fed in wait-and-see mode: Severe winter storms throughout much of the country weighed on economic data over the last few months, making it hard to get a clean reading on the recovery. Retail sales, job growth, housing and manufacturing all seem to have been impacted, but it's unclear whether the slowdown was temporary.

"The question is how much of this activity comes back in the spring, how much is simply lost, and how much the slowdown reflects other factors..." Julia Coronado, chief North American economist for BNP Paribas, wrote in a research note.

Coronado expects the Fed will acknowledge the harsh winter in its policy statement and may even nudge some of its economic forecasts lower for the year.

That said, Yellen is still expected to express some optimism about the economy picking up in the spring.

4) Yellen is still focused on jobs, jobs, jobs: Following the Fed's meeting, Yellen will take questions from reporters in a press conference Wednesday afternoon. She's likely to emphasize that she remains deeply concerned about ongoing weakness in the labor market.

As of February, 3.8 million Americans were unemployed for at least six months, and 7.2 million workers were stuck in part-time jobs, even though they would prefer full-time hours. Yellen looks closely at both measures, and neither has improved much lately.

Meanwhile, inflation remains well under the Fed's goal for 2% over the long-run, so Yellen is unlikely to view rising prices as a major concern.###1116||Empty###1117||King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.



"Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.



Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.



"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.



Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.



However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.



"I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.



"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."



Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.



ANOTHER ZYNGA?



"Candy Crush" launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.



The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".



Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.



But most of that growth was fueled by "Candy Crush" rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.



King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.



Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of "Farmville" waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of "Angry Birds".



Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.



To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in "Candy Crush" gross bookings.



However, bookings rose for its other games such as "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga". About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.



King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (r.reuters.com/bar57v).



"The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."



NYSE DEBUT



King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.



Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.



Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.



In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.



At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.



Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.



JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.###1118||US highway safety agency abetted GM cover-up of defect linked to fatal crashes

By Shannon Jones

12 March 2014

Clear evidence has surfaced revealing the complicity of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the prolonged cover-up of a defect in General Motors vehicles tied to at least 13 fatalities. The deaths related to frontal crashes in which airbags did not deploy.

In February GM issued a recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide due to a problem with the ignition system of certain models, which can shift unexpectedly out of the “run” position causing the engine to cut off while driving. The recall involves the 2005–2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, the 2003–2007 Saturn Ion and four other models. The company could face civil as well as criminal penalties for failing to respond to the problem in a timely manner.

On Monday the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it would hold hearings on the protracted delay by GM in announcing the recall. For its part, GM has shifted into full damage control mode, appointing a high-profile attorney to lead an internal investigation of the matter.

According to a March 8 report in the New York Times, the NHTSA received more than 260 complaints over the last 11 years about the safety defect, but refused to carry out an investigation. The complaints involved the cars’ engines suddenly cutting off, sometimes at high speeds, seriously impairing steering and braking. The defect can also lead to the failure of the air bag to deploy in the event of a crash.

In one case, a woman in New Jersey informed the NHTSA and GM in June 2005 that her daughter’s 2005 Cobalt shut down completely three times while in operation, including in traffic. Both the mother and daughter brought the matter to the attention of the dealer, who merely suggested removing extra keys from the keychain. When the problem continued they terminated the lease at a cost of thousands of dollars.

While GM has only publicly admitted to 31 crashes linked to the defect, a review of NHTSA records shows there were at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries since 2003 involving the now recalled cars. How many were linked to the defect is not known at this time.

According to a timeline released by GM management, the automaker was aware of the problem in 2004, but rejected a fix proposed by engineers. By the end of 2007 GM knew of at least 10 frontal crashes in which airbags did not deploy, but still refused to issue a recall order.

Documents from a lawsuit show that in 2005 GM issued a technical service bulletin for the Cobalt for engine stalling as a result of the key moving in the ignition. The suit was filed by the parents of a 29-year-old Georgia woman, Brooke Melton, who died in a March 2010 crash while driving her 2005 Cobalt. The ignition switch had shifted out of the “on” position at the time of the crash. Melton’s death is not included in GM’s count of 13 people killed in frontal crashes where airbags failed to deploy.

The case also forced GM to turn over documents showing that it bought back at least 13 Cobalts from customers who complained about engines stalling or power loss as early as the spring of 2005. During a deposition related to the case, attorneys for the Melton family also learned that GM set up a team headed by a high-ranking company executive in 2011 to investigate the ignition problem.

The defect has led to an undisclosed number of lawsuits against GM. Those seeking to sue GM for the deaths of family members are being told that the automaker is not liable for claims arising from incidents or accidents prior to July 2009 when it emerged from bankruptcy.

The NHTSA, the government agency that is supposed to serve as a watchdog over the auto manufacturers, was well aware of the problem by 2007. Crashes involving Cobalts triggered three Special Crash Investigations seeking to determine why new “smart” airbags were not deploying.

One investigation looked at a fatal crash in Wisconsin involving a 2005 Cobalt in which the airbag did not inflate. The report noted that the ignition switch was not in the “on” position at the time of the crash. The NHTSA also noted that it had at least six complaints on record where the engine suddenly shut off on the Cobalt.

Center for Auto Safety Executive Director Clarence Ditlow spoke to the World Socialist Web Site about the GM recall. “The first responsibility is General Motors. But it is a broader problem,” he said. “The NHTSA knew about it. There was an accident in Maryland that identified the problem. They had a meeting about it, but there are no records. When you have the auto industry and NHTSA work behind closed doors you get dirty deals like this. The NHTSA identified the defect in 2007, but failed to act.”

He indicated that the 13 deaths related to the defect were likely only the tip of the iceberg. “Thirteen is what GM admits to, but it doesn’t include the Melton death.”

Ditlow compared the present crisis to the recall of the Ford Pinto in the 1970s whose gas tank could easily rupture, causing a fire. “I would rank it with the Pinto—it is one of the worst defects ever and you have such a clear cover-up.”

The cover-up of the defect with the Cobalt also recalls the 2000 recall involving the failure of Firestone tires on the Ford Explorer sports utility vehicle. Both companies were well aware of the problem, which was eventually tied to more than 200 deaths, but failed to take any action for years. For its part the NHTSA had been alerted to the fact that the tires were separating from their treads by insurance researchers, but also failed to act.

In the wake of that recall Congress enacted legislation requiring automakers to more promptly report accidents related to safety defects. But with the Cobalt, GM simply ignored the law, abetted by government regulators.

The revelations in the latest recall point to the systematic dismantling of serious oversight of safety throughout US industry. It follows decades in which safety regulations covering everything from automobiles to food and medicine have been gutted in the name of “free market” principles and government oversight agencies staffed with frontmen for big business.

A case in point is David Strickland, the former head of the NHTSA, who resigned in late 2013 to take a job with a law firm that deals in auto regulation. The company, Venable LLP, gained notoriety for its role in fighting the moratorium on offshore drilling following the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Strickland has been assigned to work on the firm’s regulatory group, which represents automakers on a number of issues, including matters before the NHTSA.

Disappointing economic data released by both China and Japan has contributed to a fall in Asian stock markets during trading today (March 10th).

The new week has got off to a bad start as a result of the figures, which led to Japan revising down its 2013 growth estimates. China also revealed in a new set of economic data that its exports have dropped by 18.1 per cent, in a move that surprised analysts.

This led to drops for all the major Asian indexes over the course of the session, with the Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and the Shanghai Composite each down by more than 1.6 per cent. The Nikkei, the main stock market in Japan, was also down for the day and ended the session over one per cent down, reports BBC News. The Nikkei had hit a five-week high last week.

Economic targets

China's finance minister Lou Jiwei stated that it would be acceptable if the country slightly missed its targets for economic growth. The nation is aiming to grow its economy by 7.5 per cent this year to ease fears from investors of a slowdown in the country's growth.

"Whether GDP growth is to the left or to the right of 7.5 per cent, that is not very important," said Mr Lou, according to a report by international news agency Reuters.

Also included in the newly released economic data for China was that the country reported a slowdown in inflation, with a drop to two per cent in February from 2.5 per cent in January shown in the figures. This was noted by the Asian nation to be the slowest rate in 13 months.

Japan has reported its largest deficit since 1985 and the country also revised its 2013 economic growth from one per cent to 0.7 per cent, indicating that the nation is yet to put the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster behind it.

The clear-up operation at Fukushima is ongoing and the Japanese government has had to pay large sums to make the site safe in the wake of the nuclear accident.

The move comes weeks after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of $500 million.

The moves demonstrate that — despite the lingering spectre of King social games competitor Zynga’s volatile stock, and arguments that gaming companies, with their revenues heavily dependent on the hit of a single game, may be better off staying private — free-to-play giant King and its backers (Apex being the largest, with others like Index Ventures also holding significant shares) are stepping up to take advantage of public markets that have largely been rewarding tech IPOs.

Even if Candy Crush Saga — or King’s other popular free-to-play games like Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga and Bubble Witch Saga — will eventually see a decline, that’s not the case for now.

In December 2013, it said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day. In today’s updated filing, King noted that in February 2014, “an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.” “We believe Candy Crush Saga, our top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time,” the company wrote in the filing. That game alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

King derives its revenues from in-game purchases — in fact it wound down advertising on its platform last year. That has led to a big boom in sales, with King pulling in $1.88 billion in revenues in 2013, up from only $164 million in 2012.

The company is banking heavily on mobile for future growth. In Q4 2013, 73% of its gross bookings were from its mobile audience.

Earlier this week, Reuters made an interesting case for King playing out another strategy: this helps set up the company for a strategic acquisition:

The main reason to go public, however, could just be that the IPO market is so frothy right now that companies have to have the credible threat of an IPO in order to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer. Right until the day before the IPO, King is going to retain the option to simply sell itself to some company which wants proven expertise at making enormous profits in the world of mobile-native apps. By moving towards an IPO, King is forcing those companies to get serious about making an offer.

Regardless of whether such a development happens, for now expect King to trade as KING on the NYSE when it goes public.###1122||Another Bank of England policymaker has raised concern about how a strengthening sterling could derail efforts to lift exports and rebalance the UK's recovering economy.

Charlie Bean, a deputy governor at the BoE who sits on the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), noted that sterling had fallen in value by more than 25% during the financial crisis which should have driven up demand for British exports.

"Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports," Bean said in a Darlington speech.

"The performance of exports – particularly exports of services – has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing.

"It may be that this is just a matter of time – for instance, we are starting to hear stories of businesses bringing back activities that they had previously off-shored to emerging economies.

"But any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports."

Sterling has been hitting new highs against the US dollar and euro, currencies of two of the UK's key trading partners.

Bean's comments follow those of fellow MPC member Ian McCafferty who said a stronger sterling would be a good reason to delay hiking interest rates.

"I don't think to my mind at present [sterling is] a major problem for British exporters," said McCafferty.

"But were it to rise further ... then I think it is something we would need to study quite closely."

Chancellor George Osborne has targeted a £1tn value for UK exports by the end of the decade.

This is under his drive to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and away from its reliance on services, which account for three quarters of GDP.

But he has admitted that the recovery, which saw the economy grow by 1.8% in 2013, is not yet balanced or sustainable as global demand for UK exports remains subdued.

The BoE's base rate is at a record-low of 0.5%. Policymakers said they would not raise interest rates until productivity picks up, incomes are no long in real terms decline, and the recovery looked to be secured.

A stronger sterling could delay any rise in interest rates.###1123||Read more in Special Coverage:

Herbalife says it welcomes the inquiry, noting a “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business. The company says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulators and plans to cooperate fully.

The company announced this just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company. Ackman has repeatedly has bet against the company and repeatedly said he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme.

Herbalife Ltd.’s shares plunged more than 12 percent after a suspension in trading was lifted.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa became a senior advisor for the company last year.

“Markets are confused right now, after getting conflicting set of data. On the one hand, job openings indicated demand for workers and improvement in labor markets, on the other, wholesale inventories rose, as businesses overshot and could not sell goods sooner,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, portfolio manager and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital.

Tuesday’s economic data were deemed mostly secondary and provided little direction to stocks in early trade.

Job openings rose in January in line with expectations. There were 3.97 million openings compared with 3.91 million in December. The so-called Jolts survey is one of the pieces of labor market data that Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said she pays attention to.

U.S. wholesale inventories rose in January while wholesale sales fell, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.

Small-business sentiment, released before the market open, slumped in February. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, its small-business index dropped by more than expected, on concerns over sales, the economy and employment driving the downturn.

Among individual stocks, retailers were in the spotlight. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEO, +0.96% tumbled 7.8% after fourth-quarter profit and outlook disappointed.

Shares of Urban Outfitters Inc. URBN, -1.36% fell 4.3% after the company reported results on Monday that revealed a drop in fourth-quarter same-store sales late Monday.

Shares of Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. DKS, -1.84% rose 4.3% after the company posted results that largely met forecasts.

Shares of Macy’s M, -0.73% and J.C. Penney rose after upgrades from analysts.

JC Penney J.C. Penney shares jump on analyst upgrade.

J.C. Penney Co. JCP, +1.34% shares rose sharply initially, but gained petered out and closed 2.9% higher after the retailer was upgraded to buy from neutral by Citigroup. Analyst Oliver Chen expects that the company’s “going back to basics” strategy will spur positive comparable sales in line with the retailer’s outlook.

Macy’s rose 1.4% after analysts at Wells Fargo raised the stock to outperform from market-perform.

Shares of La Jolla Pharma Co. LJPC, -6.30% soared 65%, tracking a rally late Monday after the microcap biotech said its study for a chronic kidney disease treatment showed a statistically significant improvement.

Fuel Tech Inc. FTEK, +0.20% shares sank 17% after the air-pollution-control technology company’s results fell short of Wall Street expectations late Monday.

Shares in Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc and Men’s Wearhouse, Inc rallied after the two companies agreed a merger. Jos. A. Bank gained 3.9%, Men’s Wearhouse added 4.7%.

In other markets, Asia stocks managed flat-to-positive closes after Monday’s mauling, with the China Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +2.58% closing up 0.1%. European stocks SXXP, -0.12% closed slightly higher.

Commodity prices were volatile today. Oil prices, which perked up earlier, settled at the lowest level in a month, dropping below $100 a barrel. Gold prices, settled slightly higher. Benchmark Treasury yields also ticked lower, after being higher in the morning.

The UK treasury on Tuesday made three appointments to the Bank of England's top team and shuffled seats on its two policy committees as part of an unprecedented overhaul of the 320-year-old central bank to be unveiled later by Governor Mark Carney.



The changes underscore how Mr Carney, a Canadian, is reshaping the BOE to meet the demands of its beefed-up role safeguarding the stability of the financial system, but they also introduce a note of uncertainty over looming decisions on when to raise interest rates.



The treasury said Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist who already sits on the BOE's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, will take up the post of deputy governor for monetary policy July 1. Mr Broadbent, 49, replaces Charles Bean, who is retiring from the central bank after 14 years.



Nemat Shafik, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund and a former senior official at the UK government's department for international development, will take up a new role August 1 as the BOE's deputy governor for markets and banking.



Ms Shafik, known by her nickname Minouche, will be responsible for reshaping the BOE's markets unit after it was hurt by allegations that some of its staff may have known about alleged attempts by bank traders to manipulate foreign-exchange rates. The BOE appointed a senior lawyer to lead a probe into the allegations last week, although an earlier internal investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.



Anthony Habgood, chairman of publisher Reed Elsevier, will succeed David Lees on July 1 as chairman of the BOE's court, its board of directors, the treasury also said Tuesday.



The appointments come at a crucial time for the BOE. Alongside its role setting interest rates, the central bank was handed new responsibilities to oversee the financial system and police banks last year in a shake-up of financial regulation implemented by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.



Lawmakers on parliament's treasury committee, which scrutinises economic policy, have been pushing for a radical overhaul of the storied institution to make senior staff more accountable and reform the BOE's old-fashioned governance. A 2012 report into the BOE by Bill Winters, a former investment banker, criticised the central bank's "centralised and hierarchical" culture, saying it stifled challenges to senior staff's views.



Mr Carney is due to announce further details of how the BOE will be reorganised under his watch at a lecture in London later Tuesday. In past testimony to parliament, the governor has signalled that he sees reforming the BOE as a priority of his five-year tenure.



Alongside the new appointments, the treasury and the BOE said Spencer Dale, the BOE's chief economist, and Andrew Haldane, director of its financial stability wing, would swap jobs, with Mr Haldane joining the rate-setting MPC as chief economist and Mr Dale moving off to join the Financial Policy Committee, which tackles risks to the financial system. Paul Fisher, the BOE's executive director for markets, will lose his seat on the MPC to Ms Shafik, the BOE said.



The changes mean the MPC is getting an influx of new blood before crucial decisions on when to raise interest rates, which analysts said makes it harder to gauge how the MPC will respond if the economy continues to improve.



"What does all this mean for the direction of policy? Well the truth is it is hard to know, but it certainly adds a degree of raised uncertainty as to how the debate on the MPC will go," said David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas.###1133||by John McNeill

AUBURN HILLS (WKZO) -- Chrysler is recalling over 25-thousand Jeep and Dodge SUV’s because of a braking issue, even though there haven’t been any reports of accidents or injuries.

They plan to adjust and update software to improve the “feel” of the brake pedal during hard braking maneuvers.

Industry expert Katie Kerwin isn’t sure she has ever heard of a recall just to fix the “feel” of a vehicle but it makes sense in this case, because the feel of the brake could be critical in an emergency.

It has to do with the flow of the brake fluid through the system when the brake pedal is suddenly depressed.

Customers will be notified when it’s their turn for servicing. Chrysler will cover the cost.###1134||You must sign in or register to continue reading content.

WASHINGTON – Job openings increased less than expected in January, a sign labor market cooling from late 2013 persisted as severe winter weather hammered the eastern and midwestern United States.

The number of positions waiting to be filled increased by 60,000 to 3.97 million, from a revised 3.91 million the prior month, the Labor Department said Tuesday in Washington. The pace of hiring fell and fewer Americans quit their jobs.

The report follows data last week showing that February payrolls beat estimates after hiring in January was depressed by the weather. Faster hiring would help spur the wage growth needed to boost consumer spending, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the economy.

“Hiring was delayed during the winter due to bad weather, and I think we’ve started to see some catch-up already in the February figures,” said Ryan Wang, an economist at HSBC Securities USA Inc. in New York, speaking before the report. “We’ll continue to see gradual improvement in measures like quit rates and hiring rates.”

Tuesday’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind monthly employment figures. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 4.02 million job openings after a previously reported 3.99 million a month earlier.

The gain in openings indicates employers were confident about the economic expansion even as colder-than-normal weather limited hiring.

Employment rose by 175,000 in February, recovering after a lull in hiring that saw payroll gains of 129,000 in January and 84,000 in December, Labor Department figures showed last week. The jobless rate inched up to 6.7 percent last month from 6.6 percent the prior month, the lowest since 2008.

Tuesday’s Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report showed the number of people hired fell to 4.54 million in January, leaving the hiring rate unchanged at 3.3 percent.

Some 2.38 million people quit their jobs in January, down from the prior month’s 2.42 million tally. The quits rate, which shows how willing workers are to leave their jobs, declined to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent.

The JOLTS report is among data monitored by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. It also made an appearance in the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting ended Jan. 29.

“Overall, labor market indicators appeared consistent with a gradual ongoing improvement in labor market conditions,” the minutes state. “Among other indicators of labor market conditions, the rate of job openings edged up in recent months.”

Tuesday’s report also showed total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left their job voluntarily, increased to 1.74 million in January from 1.7 million a month before.

Job openings in the health-care, education and leisure and hospitality fields were among those accounting for the biggest increases in available employment, while the retail and trade, transportation and utilities industries showed declines.

In the 12 months ended in January, the economy created a net 2.2 million jobs, representing 54.3 million hires and 52.1 million separations.

Considering the almost 10.2 million Americans who were unemployed in January, today’s figures indicate there are about 2.6 unemployed people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the recession began in December 2007.

Mooresville, N.C.-based Lowe’s is among companies with plans to add staff, setting the stage for further gains in employment as Americans return to stores once temperatures turn more seasonable. The company said Feb. 19 that it will be adding about 25,000 seasonal employees this year for the industry’s busiest season.

Meanwhile, companies including Staples, the largest U.S. office-supplies chain, are among those likely to lay off workers. The Framingham, Mass.-based company will close as many as 12 percent of its North American stores as online competition hurts sales, it said March 6.###1135||Empty###1136||While we didn't report on the story ourselves, Amazon's decision to raise the price of its Prime membership service by $20 (to $100 a year) has hard corners of the internet up in arms, albeit over something no one really needs in the first place.

If you're not in one of the countries where Prime is available (I was surprised to learn that it is, in fact, available outside the US), you may not be familiar with the service. The gist is free 2-day shipping on a huge number of items (even a $1000+ 3-piece sectional sofa) available on Amazon, reduced pricing on overnight or weekend shipping, Kindle Lending Library access, and Amazon Prime's Instant Video service, which has thousands of free TV episodes and movies. For less than $10 a month, it's still a pretty remarkable deal.

And yet, there is decided angst being expressed about the change on various social networks, and the tech media is eating it up. So, we're curious - is the price hike going to cause you to say goodbye to Prime? Have you even said hello? I know I'll be keeping my subscription (which is still student for another year, though I'd happily pay $100 for the 'Prime Privilege'), as I know I get way more than my money's worth from the service between TV / movies and free shipping without having to spend $35 per order. Hell, I order my toothpaste from Amazon - I'd probably pay $150 a year for it without so much as flinching.

But $20 more a year has apparently caused some people to already pull the plug on their subscriptions. What say you?

Has the Amazon Prime price increase (from $80 to $100) caused you to cancel your subscription? Yes, I've already cancelled my Prime membership because of the price change, and will not renew.

I'm considering cancelling in light of the price hike, but I haven't yet.

No, I'm keeping my Prime membership.

No, but I would have cancelled if I didn't have a student rate membership / used the gift certificate loophole.

I don't have Prime in the first place / it isn't available here. View Results###1137||Vodafone has announced that it will purchase Spanish fixed line operator in a deal which is worth 7.2 billion Euros or $10 billion US dollars.

The company recently sold its share of Verizon Wireless in the US, Vodafone raised around $130 billion US dollars from the sale of their Verizon stake.

“Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction — together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme — will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.”

Vodafone certainly has plenty of spare cash after the sale of their Verizon Wireless stake, and we can probably expect more deals like this one in the future.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Despite massive objections around the world, Amazon (AMZN) has raised the price of its Prime service to $99 from $79, but offered users a chance to lock in the lower rate for the next seven days.

On its Web site, Amazon announced it was raising the price of Prime, "[f]or the first time since it was introduced nine years ago, the price of Prime is going up." When existing Prime members have their subscriptions run out, they will pay $99, while Amazon Student members will pay $49. However, if customers sign up for Prime within the next seven days they can lock in the lower rate of $79 for the first year.

Following the announcement, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said it could generate an additional $460 million in revenue for the company, as the company continues to add subscribers. "Purchases are habitual and are not impacted by seasonality for Prime members at this point."



WATCH: Amazon Hikes Amazon Prime Price for First Time in Nine Years

Some have considered the move controversial, suggesting that raising the price of Prime 25% will cause mass defections to other services, including Netflix (NFLX), which competes with Prime from a content perspective. Amazon Prime also offers users free, two-day shipping on goods ordered from Amazon's Web site.

TheStreet conducted a survey earlier this year, when the company announced it was first considering raising the price of the service. Of the more than 1,000 people surveyed between Jan. 31, 2014 and Feb. 2, 2014, 70.1% of respondents said "no" when asked if they thought the service was worth having at a higher price, regardless of whether they currently use it or not. Just 13% of the sampling subscribed to Prime.

Others have done surveys as well, and found similar results. UBS partnered with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners and found that while 94% of consumers would review at the $79 annual fee, that number dropped sharply with a price increase. Only 58% of those surveyed would renew if the price rose by $20, and just 24% said they would renew their memberships if the price rose by $40, to $119 annually. At the time of the survey, Amazon was considering raising the price between $20 and $40.

"Our survey results call into question our prior views about the value that a broad set of consumers are applying to the current iteration of Amazon Prime," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note, downgrading the stock.

Amazon has never fully disclosed the exact number of Amazon Prime users it has, but Macquarie analyst Ben Schacter recently confirmed with Amazon that it had more than 20 million members without being more specific.

The move comes as Amazon is getting ready to introduce a set-top bo to compete with others in the marketplace, including ones from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) and Roku. It's thought that the set-top box will be a gateway for Amazon to not only sell more Prime subscriptions, but allow users to watch movies and television shows from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu Plus on the box as well.

Shares of Amazon were higher in premarket trading following the announcement, gaining 2.3% to $379.12 in early Thursday trade.

-- Written by Chris Ciaccia###1139||Empty###1140||There's been a new twist in the battle for France's second largest telco SFR, with would-be owner Bouygues upping its offer by €1bn.

Last week it emerged that both Bouygues and Altice had bid for SFR , hoping to merge it with their own comms businesses: mobile operator Bouygues Telecom in the case of the former, and cable company Numericable in the case of the latter.

Numericable's offer reportedly included €11bn in cash and a 32 percent share in the newly-merged company. Bouygues initially offered €10.5bn in cash in return for 46 percent of the new company. Today, it announced it was raising that figure to €11.3bn in cash and a 52 percent share of the new mobile entity.

If Bouygues wins, "an IPO of the new entity is planned as soon as the merger is completed, offering Vivendi an immediate opportunity to monetise its interest," Bouygues said. Vivendi, which owns SFR, has been paving the way for the sale of the telco for some time , in order to focus on its media business.

Bouygues has also sweetened its bid of late by signing a deal with Free, the country's fourth placed mobile operator. In the event Bouygues is successful in its bid for SFR, i t will sell off parts of its network infrastructure and spectrum to Free for €1.8bn .

Herbalife fell 7.4 percent to $60.57 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 43 percent since Ackman first made his accusations.

The probe marks an achievement for Ackman, who in 2012 made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife’s shares and started working to persuade regulators to shut the company down, saying it misleads distributors, misrepresents sales figures and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. Herbalifehas repeatedly denied Ackman’s allegations while winning over allies including billionaire Carl Icahn and Post Holdings Inc. Chairman William Stiritz.

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,” the Cayman Islands-based company said today in a statement. “We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

Pershing Square and Justin Cole, a spokesman for the FTC, declined to comment.

The FTC, along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had been asked by Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, to look into Herbalife’s business practices. An advocacy group called the League of United Latin American Citizens also has met with FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez to describe alleged abuses by the company. Ramirez told Markey in a letter last month that his concerns were being ‘‘carefully considered.’’

Probe duration

The New York Times reported this week that Ackman had donated $10,000 to the advocacy group and hired a former aide to Markey as part of his anti-Herbalife campaign.

The civil investigative demand disclosed today isn’t an indication of wrongdoing and is essentially a subpoena requesting information, Michael Swartz, an analyst at SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta, said today in a note. Swartz, who recommends buying Herbalife shares, said the probe may take six to 12 months to be completed and doesn’t change his views on the company.

‘‘Ironically, the FTC’s action could be a longer-term positive for the stock,” he said. For now, though, the shares will trade in a limited range, Swartz said.

‘Palatable fine’

The investigation will most likely end with Herbalife intact while paying a “palatable fine” and agreeing to stricter controls on its multilevel marketing structure, said Robert Chapman, founder of hedge fund Chapman Capital LLC in Manhattan Beach, California. Chapman, who has been critical of Ackman, has long common stock and bullish derivative positions in Herbalife.

Since 1996, the FTC has brought 15 cases alleging that companies claiming to be multilevel marketers were in fact pyramid schemes, according to Ramirez’s letter to Markey. Last year, the FTC and three states sued Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing, accusing the Kentucky company of being a pyramid scheme that falsely claimed consumers could earn money by selling products.

People paid fees to become independent representatives, and any income they made came from recruiting new representatives and not from sales of products, according to the complaint. The scheme affected more than 100,000 consumers in the U.S. and Canada, the FTC said.

China presentation

Ackman yesterday renewed his attack on Herbalife with a two-hour presentation accusing the company’s China business of violating direct-selling laws. The investor, who has said he’d take his fight against the company “to the end of the Earth,” last year reduced his equity short bet againstHerbalife and replaced it with options in a move that he said increases his potential gain from a decline in the shares.

Defending Herbalife has been Icahn, who in early 2013 disclosed he’d taken a stake in the nutrition company and said he would discuss strategic alternatives with its management. Icahn has since increased his investment and is now Herbalife’s largest investor, with a 17 percent holding.

Another Herbalife backer is Stiritz, chairman and chief executive officer of Raisin Bran maker Post. He’s Herbalife’s fourth-largest shareholder, with about 7.4 percent of the shares.

Herbalife sells its vitamins and meal-replacement shakes through a network of independent distributors, each of which earns revenue and incentives based on product sales by them and distributors they recruit.

The report showed that the preliminary reading on the consumer sentiment index for March came in at 79.9 compared to the final February reading of 81.6. Economists had expected the index to inch up to a reading of 81.8.

The unexpected decrease by the headline index came as the gauge of consumer expectations fell to 69.4 in March from 72.7 in February.

At the same time, the report showed that the barometer of current economic conditions climbed to 96.1 in March from 95.4 in the previous month.

Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics, said most of the drop in consumer sentiment can be attributed to the unseasonably bad weather.

"Overall, since weather effects tend to be short-lived, confidence will probably rebound in the coming months," Asaf said.

She added, "With the labor market gradually improving and income growth prospects bright, any slowdown in consumption growth in the first quarter will probably be temporary too."

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations held steady at 3.2 percent in March, while the five-to-ten-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.9 percent.

According to Forbes, hackers on Sunday allegedly hijacked Karpeles’ personal blog and Reddit account to post a pair of angry letters, which said the Mt.

The man who cobbled the deal together said Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a “well-known billionaire.”

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

News_Image_File: The deal took 19 companies seven months to put together.

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said that the annual premium is in “the low, single digits of millions of dollars.” He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder. Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to discuss with the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.###1154||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery fell to a session low of $1,328.20 an ounce, the weakest since February 28.

Gold last traded at $1,336.10 an ounce during European morning hours, down 0.15%, or $1.80. Gold futures lost 1.01%, or $13.60 an ounce, on Friday to settle at $1,338.20.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,319.30 a troy ounce, the low from February 28 and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery fell to a daily low of $20.62 a troy ounce, the cheapest since February 14, before recovering to trade at 20.91, down 0.05%, or $0.01 cent.

The May contract ended Friday's session down 2.99%, or $0.64 cents, to settle at $20.92 an ounce.

Silver futures were likely to find support at $20.44 a troy ounce, the low from February 14 and resistance at $21.61, the high from March 7.

The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.

The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

Market players will be anticipating what will be closely-watched U.S. data on retail sales and consumer sentiment later in the week for further indications of the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

Losses were limited as investors continued to monitor events in the Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery tumbled 1.6%, or $0.049 cents, to trade at $3.033 a pound.

Prices hit a session low of $2.996 a pound earlier, the weakest since June 25, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing expectations for a 6.8% increase.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.

A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations, while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts for a 1.9% drop.###1157||Bitcoin virtual currency loses credibility among Chinese financial institutions, but not yet with Chinese merchants. (Bitcoin/UPI)

TOKYO, March 10 (UPI) -- Anonymous hackers published what they claim is evidence of fraud conducted by Japan-based bitcoin trader Mt. Gox and the virtual money isn't missing.

Mt. Gox closed last month, claiming cybercriminals stole about 850,000 in bitcoin cybercurrency, worth more than $500 million, over several years. At the time, Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said bitcoins were lost "due to weaknesses in the system," and Mt. Gox since filed for bankruptcy in Japan.

During the weekend, however, anonymous hackers said they hacked into the trading post and accessed Mt. Gox data, ZDNet reported Monday. After taking over Karpeles' blog and an account during the weekend, the group that hacked into the system posted:

"It's time that Mt. Gox got the bitcoin communities' wrath instead of bitcoin community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data. ... Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data."

The post said "lots of people, including us," lost money and bitcoin currency, techCrunch said.

"We stole no bitcoins," the hackers posted. "There were none to steal."

Within the summary, the hackers claim Mt. Gox's current balance is 951,116 bitcoin currency, which if factual, means that customers' bitcoin wasn't lost, indicating fraud was committed.

Forbes magazine reported the 716-megabyte file dump appears to include personal data, a spreadsheet documenting more than 1 million trades, Mt. Gox's bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers' access to the information.

In a release, Mt. Gox said phishing campaigns have begun against it.###1158||Print Article

Enrollment in the Affordable Care Act hasnt gone as expected for Community Health Systems, said executive director Richard Perry.

The organization received a $100,000 grant to be used to hire two staff managers and education materials to help people get coverage through the health insurance marketplace before the deadline on March 31.

There are still many questions that individuals have, Perry said. The outreach is targeted to young individuals that dont have any insurance meaning college students. We have been enrolling individuals, but not to the extent that we should be.

The Winnebago County Health Department received a $750,000 grant from the state of Illinois. The department was one of 44 community-based organizations to receive funding, and submitted a detailed plan to the state on how it would conduct its education and enrollment activities. The organization partnered with OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center, Rockford Health System, SwedishAmerican Health System, Rock Valley College, Lifescape Community Services, United Way of Rock River Valley, Rockford Health Council, YWCA Rockford, City of Rockford Human Services, La Voz Latina and TASC, Inc.

According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, about 71,443 individuals have signed up for Obamacare in Wisconsin, and about 113,773 have signed up in Illinois.

Perry said the organization needs to get into the colleges more, and have been working on plans to gear its efforts to college-aged students.

There are also a lot of individuals like senior citizens that ask questions in regards to how it will affect them and their Medicare, he said. Those are the educational pieces, and information, our certified application professionals have already.

About four professionals are working in Beloit, and there are about 10 in the entire organization, Perry said. Some of the confusion comes over the misconceptions of the health care law itself, Perry added.

There are so many mixed signals out there and people are scared to sign up, he said. A lot of those barriers are beginning to be broken down.

Perry mentioned a recent Internet clip featuring President Barack Obama and actor Zach Galifianakis on Galifianakis show Between Two Ferns that encouraged young people without insurance to sign up on the marketplace at www.healthcare.gov.

Sue Fuller, public information officer for the Winnebago County Health Department, said the department opened up a new enrollment center for residents to schedule an appointment that need assistance with the marketplace website.

The center is located at 555 N. Court St. in Rockford and is open Monday and Tuesday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Wednesday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Computer terminals are available until 4 p.m. every day, and an appointment is necessary. To schedule an appointment call 815-720-4247. Fuller said the plan is to keep the center open until June 30.

Enrollment in the federal marketplace began on Oct. 1, but there were several complications with the website that many had to re-enroll or couldnt complete their applications. The issues seem to have been fixed, and on March 11 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that 4.2 million Americans had signed up for coverage.

Perry said for those that arent sure about the marketplace, or what coverage to get, should call or visit Community Health Systems or another health care network.

Thats where the outreach enrollment counselors come in to help educate them, he said. Each health care network has navigators that can help individuals navigate the website. Call any health care facility and ask for help with the Affordable Care Act. Other agencies are well versed in navigating the Affordable Care Act website.

Those that arent insured, and can afford it, must get insurance by March 31 or face a fee starting next year.###1159||Empty###1160||Indiana Department of Transportation officials anticipate lane closures and restrictions on a weekly basis.

MALAYSIA’S Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim has admitted he has a family connection to the MH370 pilot, who may have hijacked the plane in a political protest.

Mr Ibrahim said Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is related to his son’s in-laws, according to The Straits Times.

“I am not denying that he (Zaharie) is related to one of my in-laws and that I have met him on several occasions,” he said.

“In fact, he is a close friend of (PKR supreme council member and Subang MP) R. Sivarasa, as we said before,” Mr Anwar told reporters at the Parliament lobby in Kuala Lumpur today.

Mr Anwar had earlier denied close links to Mr Zaharie.

“I don’t recollect the name (Zaharie), but when the photographs were shown, I remembered I had seen him at party meetings,” he was quoted as saying in the South China Morning Post.

He also said they had no personal contact, but Mr Zaharie was a follower of his Twitter account.

Mr Anwar’s party Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) has dismissed reports that Mr Zaharie is a “political fanatic”, as previously reported by UK media.

The pilot was also portrayed as an “obsessive” supporter of Mr Ibrahim.

PKR communications director Fahmi Fadzil said the reports in the Daily Mail were “wild allegations” and the paper “is a sensationalist tabloid known for cooking up stories”.

This comes after speculation that Captain Zaharie Shah may have hijacked his own aircraft in a political protest.

Hours before Flight MH370 left Kuala Lumpur, the pilot is said to have attended a controversial trial in which Ibrahim — who has been harassed and jailed on successive charges of homosexuality and sodomy — was jailed for five years.

Police sources say Captain Shah was a political activist and fear that the court decision left him profoundly upset.

MH370 LATEST MEDIA UPDATE

Malaysian authorities have asked neighbouring countries to take another look at its primary radar data as the eleventh day of the search for missing flight MH370 comes to an end.

Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein says he has specifically asked Indonesian military to “relook again at satellite and any other data they may have” as it grapples with the impossible task of finding the aircraft if it crashed into the Indian Ocean.

“In the southern corridor we face more challenges because area is huge,” he told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur tonight.

“I spoke to (US Defennse) Secretary (Chuck) Hagel this morning about possibility of looking at US satellite and radar to assist us in the southern corridor,” he said.

“The discussion this morning was to update secretary Hagel on our immediate focus. The details of which I don’t need to reveal here. But the enormous area which needs to be covered with a special focus on the southern corridors, the US has got the best ability to assist us.”

Mr Hishammuddin said this new phase of the search and rescue has created new diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges.

“The search and rescue operation has taken on a new international dimension,” he said.

Mr Hishammuddin said the search operation was still being coordinated by Malaysia but that other nations were taking on increasing roles.

“On the logistic front, over past 24 hours, we’ve been working hard with other countries to narrow the search corridors,” he said.

He said their focus has been on the analysis of satellite and surveillance radar and increasing the number of technical and subject matter experts.

“I cannot disclose who has what satellite capability,” he said.

“We have contacted every relevant country that has access to satellite data.”

Malaysia Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said that as far as he knew, the aircraft was programmed to fly to Beijing.

“That’s the standard procedure. The aircraft was scheduled to fly to Beijing,” he said.

“It could be speculation (that it had been programmed to fly elsewhere). Once you’re in the aircraft anything is possible.”

Mr Ahmad said the airline’s commercial flights don’t normally use either of the corridors being searched for missing flight MH370.

He also said he was not aware of reports that the families of Chinese passengers had gone on a hunger strike.

“We are doing all we can to ensure we give sufficient assistance, information and care to all members of the passengers’ families. This is something I’m happy to look into,” he said.

“If anything like that happened we will obviously look into that immediately.”

Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato’ Sri Anifah bin Haji Aman said they were not ruling out any possibilities, including that decompression on the plane may have affected the pilot’s consciousness.

“We are not discounting any possibilities,” he said.

“It is very important to find the aircraft and evidence from the aircraft to find out what went wrong on the aircraft

He said that it’s equally important to search both the southern and northern corridors.

AUSTRALIA’S SEARCH FOR MH370 COULD TAKE ‘SEVERAL WEEKS’

Australian maritime officials today identified a search area off Western Australia, after the Taliban denied involvement in the plane’s disappearance and Chinese relatives threatened a hunger strike.

Australian, US and New Zealand planes started their hunt for the jetliner in a new search area 3000km southwest of Perth in the southern Indian Ocean.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) confirmed the search area is more than 600,000 square kilometres in size, and that it would take “several weeks” to search the area thoroughly.

Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports in Malaysian media also say investigators probing the homemade flight simulator of Capt Zaharie Shah have found five runways from Indian Ocean airports programmed into it.

The Berita Harian Malay language paper quotes unnamed sources close to the investigation as saying that the airport runways were Male International Airport in the Maldives, Diego Garcia and three runways in India and Sri Lanka.

The source is quoted as saying that all the runways programmed into the simulator are 1000 metres long.

AMSA Emergency Response Division General Manager John Young said that they will be “moving the search area according to the movement of water everyday”.

Mr Young said the search is not based on any theories of what might have happened on the aircraft, but more on where the aircraft possibly went.

He added that they are looking at what can be done with satellite imagery, to see if there is any imagery of value.

“We will modify our thinking (as we go) ... it is going to take quite a long time,” he said.

He said AMSA is also in discussion with China to see if it can provide any useful aircraft in the search.

He described the search as a “challenge” and like looking for “a needle in a haystack”, saying the “passage of time and movement of water” will make it “constantly difficult”.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament today the RAAF had conducted two sweeps over the southern corridor since taking over the search effort in the region.

“Another sweep is scheduled to take place later today,” he said at the beginning of Question Time.

He said four Australian Orion aircraft will soon be in the area, joined by a New Zealand Orion and a US Poseidon aircraft.

“We owe it to the people on this ill fated flight and their families to do what we can to solve this tragic mystery,” Mr Abbott added.

An Australian Defence Force aircraft is being relocated from the Cocos Islands to Perth for the operation and will operate out of Royal Australian Air Force Base Pearce, near Perth.

Australia already had two AP-3C Orion aircraft searching, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands.

AMSA and the ADF will look into the possibility of adding more aircraft capable of operating at long distances to the search.

“Australia will do its duty in this matter,” Mr Abbott said.

“We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery.”

The southern Indian Ocean is the world’s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

Planes will be searching for any signs of the kind of debris that might float to the surface in a crash. Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, the Malaysia Airlines CEO, said the plane had no unusual cargo, though he said it was carrying several tons of mangosteens, a purple tropical fruit.

TALIBAN DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN MISSING FLIGHT MH370

The Taliban has denied involvement in the disappearance of flight MH370 as China began searching for the missing jet in its own territory.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, told Reuters that “(we) do not have any information as it is an external issue”.

An unnamed Taliban source in Pakistan was even more candid, telling the news service: “We wish we had an opportunity to hijack such a plane”.

Chinese state media said today background checks on nationals on the missing jet showed no terror links.

Xinhua said the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia made the statement Tuesday to media in Kuala Lumpur.

There has been some speculation that Uighur separatists in far western Xinjiang province might have been involved with the flight’s disappearance.

The statement will lessen that speculation.

Xinhua also reported that Chinese authorities have begun searching for the plane on Chinese territory.

The northern corridor projected from satellite and military radar data that the aircraft might have flown through passes through far western China.

Chinese ambassador Huang Huikang said China had begun search and rescue operations in the area.

There were 154 Chinese among the 227 passengers aboard on Flight 370, which went missing March 8 on its way to Beijing.

CHINESE RELATIVES THREATEN HUNGER STRIKE

Desperate relatives of Chinese passengers aboard flight MH370 threatened to go on hunger strike today as they demanded answers about the missing aircraft.

“Now we have no news, and everyone is understandably worried. The relatives say they will go to the (Malaysian) embassy to find the ambassador,” said Wen Wancheng, whose son was aboard the missing flight.

“The Malaysian ambassador should be presenting himself here. But he’s not,” Wen said, updating reporters after a regular meeting between Malaysia Airlines officials and family members at a hotel in Beijing.

“Relatives are very unsatisfied. So you hear them saying ‘hunger strike’,” added the 63-year-old from the eastern province of Shandong, speaking as the search entered its 11th day.

Two-thirds of the passengers on the flight, which had 239 people on board, were Chinese.

Outside the meeting room, a woman clutching a placard reading “Respect life. Give us back our families” told reporters that the relatives were going on hunger strike.

She declined to say how many were doing so, or give her name. “Since they haven’t given us the truth about those people’s lives, all of us are protesting,” the woman said furiously.

“All the relatives are facing mental breakdowns,” she added. Wen also said some of the relatives had stopped going to the meetings, given how long they had been waiting for information.

“It doesn’t mean giving up,” he added. “It’s normal to return home. Like me, I have been out for a long time.” Beijing has been critical of Malaysia’s sharing of information, with state media and China’s huge army of netizens in expressing anger at the handling of the incident by Kuala Lumpur

FLIGHT PATH CHANGED IN COCKPIT

New reports today suggest the first change to Malaysian Flight MH370’s flight path was programmed into a computer in the cockpit.

According to The New York Times, American officials believe the cockpit’s Flight Management System, rather than the plane’s controls, may have been used to change the Boeing 777’s flight path.

Seven or eight keystrokes would have been used to make the change, the paper said, but it is not clear whether the computer would have been reprogrammed before or after take-off.

But the question as to who could have masterminded such a takeover remains vexing for investigators.

CO-PILOT SPOKE MH370’S LAST WORDS

Authorities in Kuala Lumpur revealed that the last words — “all right good night”, said to Malaysian air traffic control at 1.19am on March 8, were those of 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid.

Until now it was not known who last spoke on the airwaves. Those words came after one of the plane’s communications system was shut down.

Twelve minutes before the co-pilot’s last words were spoken the ACARS, or aircraft reporting system, made its last automatic transmission at 1.07am. Authorities say they are not sure exactly when it was turned off as it only transmitted every 30 minutes.

Authorities also revealed that after the missing Boeing 777-200’s last communication with a satellite, at 8.11am, that it had only about 30 minutes worth of fuel left.

However, that satellite ping cannot be narrowed down to anything smaller than a massive area covering 11 countries in two different corridors stretching from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean.

ATTENTION TURNS TO FLIGHT ENGINEER ON BOARD

The Huffington Post is reporting today that authorities are looking at a flight engineer who was on board flight MH370.

Twenty-nine year old Malaysian national Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat identified himself as an employee of Execujet Aviation Group on his Facebook page, but the Switzerland-based company declined to confirm whether he was still working for them.

The Huffington Post noted that Khairul “would not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner” but quoted an unnamed police officer who confirmed that he was being investigated.

CHASER’S JULIAN MORROW’S TASTELESS MH370 JOKES

Until now much of the focus had been on the pilot, Zaharie Ahamd Shah. Police visited the pilot and co-pilot’s homes the day after the plane disappeared and again on the weekend, when they seized a homemade flight simulator from Capt Shah’s home. Police are still analysing it and said yesterday there was nothing to reveal yet.

Asked if authorities were looking into the possibility of pilot or co-pilot suicide, Defence Minister Hussein would say only the answer is “yes”.

Ten days after MH370 went missing midway between Malaysia and Vietnam there was no evidence whatsoever that any of the 239 passengers and crew on board had tried to use their mobile telephones to make calls or send text messages.

“So far we have not had any evidence from any telephone company of any member trying to contact but …. We are still checking. There are millions of records they have to process,” Mr Hussein said.

He said this was a part of the massive multinational investigation that was still being done.

And he expressed that despite the silence from the plane and the fact that nothing has been found so far, there was always hope.

“The fact there are no distress signals, there are no ransom, there are no parties screaming to be responsible, there is always hope,” Mr Hussein said.

And he revealed that only hours earlier he had asked Chinese intelligence agencies to re-intensify their checks of everyone on their passenger list.

Yet the administration’s supporters have been mostly unmoved by this aspect of the government’s action. This seeming indifference to the continual flouting of laws, constitutional principles, and precedent has also extended to Wall Street. Yet now, thanks to a revelation about the fraud being perpetrated by the Obama administration upon investors in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , investors have finally seen the cost of this lawlessness.

A list of all the actions taken by the Obama administration that break or stretch the law is long. There are so many they can be grouped into categories: Obamacare actions, recess appointments, non-enforcement of existing laws, and participation in actions that break laws.

Most famously President Obama has now made over twenty executive changes to Obamacare that are not allowed under a plain reading the law. In the majority of these changes the administration simply announced that it will not enforce a law duly passed by Congress and signed by the President. Legalization of the “Dreamers” and letting states legalize marijuana are two more major examples of selective non-enforcement of various laws. Such acts likely break the law and certainly stretch it greatly. Under our system of government, the legislative branch (Congress) is supposed to make laws and the executive branch is supposed to enforce them, not ignore them.

Added to this list are recess appointments (such as to the National Labor Relations Board) made when the Senate was not in recess, and actions by the EPA, the National Labor Relations Board, and other federal agencies that go beyond the authority they have been given by Congress.

Much closer to home for investors, the Obama administration signaled its attitude toward the laws that govern investments almost immediately upon assuming office. Investors should have paid attention when President Obama arranged for the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler to occur in such a manner that the UAW healthcare trust funds received preferred treatment to legally superior creditors such as bondholders. This subversion of centuries of bankruptcy law precedent on the order in which creditors are paid should have warned investors that this was not an administration to be trusted. Yet, other than a few affected bondholders, most investors looked past this theft of bondholder money.

Instead, Wall Street’s top dogs have mostly given the administration a pass on its many legal violations, placated by their bailout and the fiscal and monetary policies that were boosting the stock market and making the rich even richer. While their campaign donations in the 2012 election did favor Mitt Romney over President Obama by about a 3:1 margin, the finance/insurance/real estate sector still donated over $20 million to President Obama’s reelection campaign.

Now, we have discovered that investors have been fraudulently mistreated by the Obama administration. This case deals with the two government sponsored enterprises lubricating our mortgage markets: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During the depths of the recession the Obama administration did not nationalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, instead placing them under conservatorship and taking an ownership stake in the companies. Since that time, the government has sold large blocks of stock in Fannie and Freddie three times through the FDIC. While doing so, the government neglected to inform investors that it planned to keep all of Fannie and Freddie’s profits forever, even after it has been paid back in full with interest.

When normal companies sell stock they must provide investors and the Securities and Exchange Commission with considerable details about their plan as well as enough financial and risk disclosure for investors to make informed decisions. The details disclosed must be truthful and complete or the company risks civil and criminal prosecution.

The federal government sold stock in a company with no future earning potential and handily kept that fact to itself. While prospective investors may not have expected much in the way of future earnings in 2010 or 2011, they knew there was at least a chance that Fannie and Freddie would be able to pay back the government one day and those investors could begin to collect a share of earnings from that point forward. This probability, slight though it may have been, caused investors to bid the price of Fannie Mae shares up from $0.34 to $3 per share.

In 2012 the federal government revealed an amendment to its 2008 document explaining its relationship with Fannie and Freddie. This 2012 plan, known as the Third Amendment, makes clear that the government plans to keep all of Fannie and Freddie’s earnings forever, long after the two GSEs have fully paid back the government from the housing bust’s fallout. Yet a memo, dated in 2010, details that the government plans were in place well before they were disclosed to the public.

This fraud allowed the government to find buyers for some of the shares in Freddie and Fannie that it acquired as part of its bailout, helping it to recoup the taxpayer’s money. However, this recovery of taxpayer money was accomplished at the expense of investors who trusted in the disclosures that they received from Fannie and Freddie, disclosures that the government knew to be untrue.

People can debate the wisdom and benefits of the government essentially nationalizing Fannie and Freddie. However, there is no debate about the ethics of fraud. The best way out of this dilemma is for the government to reverse the Third Amendment and begin allowing Freddie and Fannie’s shareholders to receive some or all of the future earnings. If the government did this, the fraud’s economic damages would disappear since the government just recently reached the point where it was fully paid back.

Our government is supposed to be policing securities fraud, not committing it. There is no excuse for defrauding investors just to enrich the Treasury. The government needs to admit its wrongdoing, make reparations if needed, and take steps to make sure it does not repeat this type of behavior. As for investors, they should learn that at least for the rest of the Obama administration you cannot trust the government.###1167||Empty###1168||Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources.

Police Hunt for Motive as Search for Malaysian Jet Spans Hemispheres March 16, 2014 A woman leaves a messages of support and hope for the passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 as others pose for picture in central Kuala Lumpur March 16, 2014. Malaysia says search for missing MH 370 enters new phase English.news.cn 2014-03-16 18:11:13 KUALA LUMPUR, March 16, 2014 (Xinhua) -- The search operation has entered a new phase and the search area has been significantly expanded, now involving 25 countries, Malaysian Acting Transportation Miniser Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday at a press conference. Hishammuddin Hussein said the search now focused both on shallow sea and "large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans." The number of countrires involved in the search has increased to 25 from 14, the minister said. As to information of the two pilots who were suspected by U.S. intelligence analysts of being responsible for the disappearance of MH 370, the minister said the two pilots had not asked to fly together, giving no more details. Hishammuddin Hussein also said Acars communication system had been disabled before last radio contact between plane and air traffic. Police Hunt for Motive as Search for Malaysian Jet Spans Hemispheres By Anshuman Daga and Niluksi Koswanage KUALA LUMPUR Sun Mar 16, 2014 9:01am EDT (Reuters) - Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on a missing jetliner for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course, the country's police chief said. Background checks of passengers on Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 have drawn a blank, but not every country whose nationals were on board has responded to requests for information, police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told a news conference on Sunday. No trace of the Boeing 777-200ER has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board, but investigators believe it was diverted by someone who knew how to switch off its communications and tracking systems. Malaysia has appealed for international help in the search for the plane across two corridors stretching from the shores of Caspian Sea to the far south of the Indian Ocean. "The search area has been significantly expanded," said Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. "From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans." The disappearance of the aircraft has baffled investigators, aviation experts and internet sleuths since it vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing. Malaysian authorities believe that as the plane crossed the country's northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned sharply to the west. Electronic signals it continued to exchange periodically with satellites suggest it could have continued flying for nearly seven hours after flying out of range of Malaysian military radar off the country's northwest coast, heading towards India. The plane had enough fuel to fly for about seven-and-a-half to eight hours, Malaysian Airlines' Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said. PILOTS' HOMES SEARCHED On Saturday, police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport. An experienced pilot, Zaharie has been described by current and former co-workers as a flying enthusiast who spent his off days operating a life-sized flight simulator he had set up at home. Police chief Khalid said investigators had taken the flight simulator for examination by experts. Earlier, a senior police official said the flight simulator programs were looked at closely, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allowed players to practice flying and landing in different conditions. Police sources said they were looking at the personal, political and religious backgrounds of both pilots and the other crew members. Khalid said ground support staff who might have worked on the plane were also being investigated. A second senior police official told Reuters investigators had found no links between Captain Zaharie, a father of three grown-up children and a grandfather, and any militant group. Postings on his Facebook page suggest the pilot was a politically active opponent of the coalition that has ruled Malaysia for the 57 years since independence. A day before the plane vanished, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison, in a ruling his supporters and international human rights groups say was politically influenced. Asked if Zaharie's background as an opposition supporter was being examined, the first senior police officer would say only: "We need to cover all our bases." Malaysia Airlines has said it did not believe Zaharie would have sabotaged the plane, and colleagues were incredulous. "Please, let them find the aircraft first. Zaharie is not suicidal, not a political fanatic as some foreign media are saying," a Malaysia Airlines pilot who is close to Zaharie told Reuters. "Is it wrong for anyone to have an opinion about politics?" Co-pilot Fariq was religious and serious about his career, family and friends said. The two pilots had not made any request to fly together. EXPERTS DOUBT MILITANT GROUPS INVOLVED With no clear motive established as to why someone diverted the plane, Khalid said all possibilities - hijack, sabotage, or personal or psychological problems of someone on board - were being investigated. Transport Minister Hishammuddin said authorities had not received any ransom or other demand. "That makes if very difficult for us to verify whether its a hijacking or terrorist," he said. Southeast Asia's homegrown Islamist militant groups, such as Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which carried out the Bali bombings in 2002, have been quiet in recent years after security forces either arrested or shot dead numerous members. Experts said they doubted the remaining militants had the skills or capabilities to carry out a complex hijacking. "JI has not been involved with violence in the region since 2007," said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. "The other groups that are active in Indonesia, in trying to make terrorist plots, are all not very competent. I would be extremely surprised if any group from Indonesia, the Philippines or Malaysia itself would be directly involved." Analysis of satellite data showed the last signal from the missing plane was at 8:11 a.m., almost seven hours after it turned back over the Gulf of Thailand and re-crossed the Malay peninsula. It's location was not pinpointed - experts could only determine that the plane could have been anywhere in either of two arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern arc heading from Indonesia to the vast southern Indian Ocean. Hishammuddin said Malaysia had requested further satellite data from several countries, including the United States, China and France, to help with the search. A source familiar with official U.S. assessments said it was thought most likely the plane had headed south into the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed. Air space to the north is much busier, and the plane would likely have been detected. Countries contacted by Malaysia to assist in the search range from the former Soviet central Asian republics in the north to Australia in the south, along with France, which administers a scattering of islands deep in the southern Indian Ocean uninhabited except for a handful of researchers. The Indian Ocean is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest, posing enormous challenges for efforts to find any wreckage or the flight voice and data recorders that would be key to solving the puzzle.

###1169||* Workers stop production lines as pay talks reach 10 months

* Company says left with no option but to lock out workers

* Lock-out started Sunday; no indication of end

* Raises spectre of violent 2012 labour dispute at Suzuki (Adds shares, Indian sales, market share, context)

TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Indian unit has temporarily closed its two plants where some workers had stopped production lines to protest a delay in salary hikes after 10 months of negotiations.

The factories near Bangalore are Toyota Motor’s only vehicle plants in the world’s sixth-biggest auto market, where the Japanese manufacturer generates just a sliver of global sales.

Their closure raises the spectre of labour unrest at Indian car plants in recent years, including a 2012 dispute at Suzuki Motor Corp unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. A riot left one person dead and over 100 injured, and resulted in a $250 million month-long production loss.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), the world’s biggest car maker’s Indian unit, in a statement said some workers over the past 25 days had disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government negotiated wages.

“The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel,” TKM said.

The subsidiary closed the factories on Sunday - a non-production day - and did not state when it will reopen them.

Closure would result in a daily production loss of 700 vehicles, said Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino in Tokyo.

TKM and the union will continue holding talks to resolve the issue, Sumino said.

Shares of Toyota Motor were down 0.1 percent at 0531 GMT in Tokyo, in line with the benchmark Nikkei index.

India accounted for just 1.6 percent of Toyota Motor’s global sales last year. At that time, the Japanese manufacturer held 4.5 percent of the Indian market having made 174,000 vehicles and sold 147,000.

Subsidiary TKM has been building cars at one of the locked-out plants since 1997 including the Fortuner and Innova, and at the other since 2010 including Etios and Corolla Altis.

The lockout comes just a week after Toyota Motor gave Japanese workers their biggest pay increase in 21 years, and two months after the automaker said social unrest in Thailand could lead it to rethink investment.

“For years, the city obtained payments from Time Warner a franchise fee and an obligation for education,” Feuer said. “In 2008, Time Warner failed to provide that fee … It protested it did not have to pay that fee.”

Time Warner issued a statement noting it was disappointed in the city’s action.

“As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the City of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen,” the statement read. “We believe (the legal action) is without merit. It will now be resolved through the legal process.”

Feuer said state law changed in 2008 regarding the franchise fee, shifting it to the state from local jurisdictions. But Los Angeles was allowed to keep a formula where it continues to charge for the use of right of way, telephone poles and the network of cable wires and boxes on city streets.

The company’s decision to withhold the funds came at the height of the recession, a particularly difficult time for the city, Feuer said. “This is money that could have paid for 100 cops on the street, repaired 50 miles of streets and trimmed hundreds of trees.

“The suit alleges that at the same time Time Warner was withholding payments to the city, it was raking in billions of dollars in revenue. They had a virtual monopoly for the provision of cable service in Los Angeles.”

Feuer said the timing of his legal action had nothing to do with the ongoing dispute Time Warner has with other operators over access to Los Angeles Dodgers games or the negotiations between it and Comcast, adding that the city has been in negotiations with Time Warner since 2011, without any progress in resolving the dispute.###1175||Empty###1176||Empty###1177||The companies also said that they are ending a reciprocal frequent flyer program accrual agreement.

The peace between Los Angeles and Time Warner Cable has lasted exactly six months.

On Friday, city attorney Mike Feuer announced the filing of a lawsuit that claims the cable company owes nearly $10 million in franchise and public, educational and government ("PEG") access fees from 2008 through 2011.

The dispute is hardly new.

Two years ago, a similar lawsuit was filed. As we wrote back then, the controversy erupted after the enactment of the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 where incumbent cable operators transitioned from locally issued cable franchises to video service provider franchises issued by the state of California. The following year, Los Angeles updated its code to require each state-franchised video service provider within its borders pay a franchise fee of up to five percent of gross revenue plus a one percent PEG fee.

STORY: 5 Possible In-House Replacements for Disney's Anne Sweeney

At the time of the 2012 lawsuit, there was talk that TWC was taking the position of not being required to pay the PEG fee under "grandfathered" obligations. Against that contention, Los Angeles demanded $700,000 in money allegedly owed.

Fast forward to last September.

The two sides reached a settlement with each other. Here it is. The parties attempted to put the dispute behind them, citing among other things, money that "could be put to better use" than litigation and a respective "desire to improve their overall relations."

(Clarification: The LA City's Attorney's Office writes to us to let us know that the County, not the City, of Los Angeles, was responsible for the 2012 lawsuit.)

Further, the settlement obligated TWC to carry the "County Channel," devoted to public-minded programming. As for money owed, LA kept a $143,046 payment already made by TWC but it doesn't appear there was any more money changing hands. LA released TWC from claims except for claims not known or suspected at the time of the agreement.

Now comes the new lawsuit.

The city of LA is now painting TWC, which Comcast is attempting to acquire, as a company which "has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the City of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the City of Los Angeles fully for this privilege."

Despite the statutory changes shifting the system from local to a state-wide cable franchising, LA is insisting that TWC be "required to pay a franchise fee in lieu of rent for its use of the public right-of-way, that is, the privilege of placing its network of cable wires and boxes under the City's streets, on the City's telephone poles, in the City's neighborhoods."

LA says after acquiring the cable services of the bankrupt Adelphia, TWC now controls over more than 90 percent of the area's cable television market, which the city says has "been accompanied by allegations of unexpected rate hikes and sever disruption in the continuity and quality of service, among other wrongful consumer practices."

The complaint adds, "To justify its actions in refusing to pay its franchise fee obligations, Time Warner contended -- incredibly and for the first time -- that it had never been obligated to provide much of the non-monetary support for the public access studios that the company operated up to and including 2008... Perhaps not by coincidence, TWC's precipitous and wrongful withholding of the franchise fee occurred less than eight weeks before the end of Los Angeles' 2010-2011 fiscal year, exacerbating the City's well-publicized fiscal crisis, and further reducing the City's ability to pay for its already diminished core services."

TWC says it is "disappointed" the city has chosen to bring the lawsuit and believes it "is without merit."

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.###1185||The UK Treasury has unveiled a change of guard at the Bank of England after appointing two new deputy governors as well as shuffling around existing staff.

The car rental company says it will receive about $2.5 billion in net proceeds as part of the transaction and plans to use it to pay down debt and to support a new $1 billion stock buyback. Hertz also reported a smaller loss for the fourth quarter.



Its shares fell in premarket trading Tuesday after rising earlier.



The new business will be called Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. The company rents equipment such as air compressors and tools, earthmoving equipment and power generators, forklifts and material handling, pumps, and trucks and trailers. It also sells new and used equipment and its Hertz Entertainment Services unit rents lighting and related aerial products used mostly by the U.S. entertainment industry.



Hertz Equipment Rental has approximately 335 branches in the U.S., Canada, France, Spain, China, Saudi Arabia and through international franchisees. It had more than $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013.



The spinoff will leave Hertz with the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly rental car businesses and Donlen, which provides fleet leasing and management services. The company has about 11,555 rental locations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and New Zealand. Last year the rental car and fleet leasing business had $9.23 billion in revenue.



Its board has approved the separation plans. Mark Frissora will remain Chairman and CEO of Hertz.



The equipment rental company will determine its management and board as separation plans are finalized.



Hertz Global Holdings Inc. anticipates the spinoff closing by early next year.



The new $1 billion stock repurchase program replaces a $300 million buyback announced last year. Hertz used about $87.5 million under that buyback.



Its stock slipped 28 cents to $26.94 in premarket trading about 2 hours ahead of the market open after initially rising as high as $28.



The company also reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results on Tuesday. For the three months ended Dec. 31, Hertz lost $600,000, or had breakeven per share results. A year earlier it lost $36.8 million, or 9 cents per share.



Excluding certain items, earnings were 26 cents per share.



Revenue climbed 10 percent to $2.56 billion from $2.32 billion.



Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of 32 cents per share on revenue of $2.61 billion.



For the full year Hertz earned $346.2 million, or 76 cents per share. That compares with $238.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the previous year. Adjusted earnings were $1.63 per share. Annual revenue increased 19 percent to $10.77 billion from $9.02 billion.



Hertz foresees 2014 adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $2 per share, with revenue in a range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion. Wall Street anticipates earnings of $2.07 per share on revenue of $11.6 billion.###1188||Quiznos announced today that, as we reported a few weeks ago, the company will be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a move that will let the chain cut its debt load by about 2/3. That’s great news for the corporate headquarters, but will dissatisfied franchisees be happy with the plan?

Franchisees blame the company for charging too much for supplies that they could buy for less elsewhere. In their bankruptcy filing, meanwhile, Quiznos turned around and blamed some franchisees. Their argument: inexperienced restaurant operators who opened new outposts during the company’s recent expansion have hurt the brand due to their lack of experience in the quick-serve biz.

Quiznos has about 2,100 restaurants left, most of which are franchises. Owners complain that the cost of running a Quizno’s is too high, making it difficult to compete with other fast-food and quick-serve restaurants.

In the Consumerist archives, we can see some of the problems that Quiznos cites: poorly run restaurants where small children make the sandwiches, you’re not allowed to have a sandwich without meat on it, employees were rude to the elderly, and they served up whatever the hell this is.

From our perch watching over Consumerland, the biggest problem for Quiznos in recent years has been that longtime conflict with franchisees. Specifically, the problem where Corporate would issue coupons and promotions, and franchisees would refuse to participate.

Sometimes there were good reasons. The Million-Sub Giveaway was a big promotion where the chain, well, gave away a million subs. According to a tipster who contacted Consumerist back in 2009, the problem was that Quiznos designed the promotion, then wanted franchisees to bear the entire cost of giving away all of those subs. Readers reported that they had trouble redeeming the free sub coupons, since franchisees found the money-losing promo to be a bad deal.

Quiznos will need to mend their relationships with franchise owners, the brand’s relationship with consumers, and then also somehow patch up the relationship on the ground and in the strip malls between franchise owners and their customers. We like hot sandwiches, so we hope they succeed.

That’s a lesson every investor should take away from the panic of 2009, and it’s applicable everywhere — even now, as we sit around all-time highs.

I remember the scene as if it was yesterday: It was Sept. 15, 2008, and investment banking giant Lehman Bros. had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The S&P 500 fell more than 4.5% on the day, and as I left the office around 6pm after a busy trading day in Manhattan, the streets were quiet — much too quiet for New York City.

On any other day, a sea of yellow cabs greeted me right outside my building in mid-town Manhattan, but not on Sept. 15. I found myself walking a few blocks north just to find a cab. It was eerie. With the financial epicenter of the globe being shaken to the core that day, the fear in the air was palpable.

The market eventually would take the market through a shaky autumn and winter. In fact, it wouldn’t be until six months later, while headlines of doom and gloom were still flying faster than ever, that the market began to climb out of the abyss. On March 6, 2009, the S&P 500 finally capitulated to the ironic intraday level of 666, then on March 9, the market hit its closing low point at 676.53. A day later, stocks saw a big follow-through buying day, with the index rallying more than 6%.

As it usually goes, neither the media nor the investing crowd took the March 10 bounce as anything more than a short-lived lift, and those smart enough to buy kept very quiet. But to me, it became clearer that considering the typical six-month lag in which the market works, coupled with the still-paralyzed investing public, at least a medium-term bottom was in place.

I wasn’t smart/dumb enough to go all-in on stocks that day either, but because the psychological picture seemed to match up with what I saw on the charts, I knew better not to be caught short the market at the time.

I was right.

Of Bulls and Bears

The general story in terms of bull and bear markets, particularly in the S&P 500, is that roughly every 13- to 17-year bull market is followed by a 10- to 15-year bear. (The Great Depression, depending on when you’re measuring from, stands out as an exception.)

So, looking at the below chart of the S&P 500, which spans all the way back to 1927, this rhythm should somewhat stand out. After a flat tape the bear market from the mid-’60s through the early ’80s, the S&P 500 began its great bull run. Aside from the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, the bull market really kept running until the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s and early aughts popped. This then led to the “lost decade” and the easy monetary policy introduced by then-Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, during which stocks wildly gyrated and ultimately bottomed five years ago … in March 2009.



Click to Enlarge

Looking at the past 20 or so years of trading in the S&P 500 a little more closely, what stands out on the below weekly chart is that the March 2009 capitulation marginally and classically broke below the index’s 2002 lows. This helped to wash out all those players who placed their stop-loss orders around this area, and paved the path for the steep and vicious rally we have witnessed since.

The nail in the coffin for the bears came in spring 2013, when the S&P 500 broke to fresh all-time highs, leaving behind the market tops from 2000 and 2007.



Click to Enlarge

This has, in my opinion, given birth to a new secular bull market — the long 13- to 17-year type of cycle that I discussed above.

However, with the cyclical bull market now five years of age, it is slowly but surely getting somewhat long in the tooth. While many sectors and industries/groups of stocks still look good on the long side, it is somewhat too early to clear the portfolio and or lean short this market. But if history is any guide, then at some point over the next three to nine months, a first cyclical bear market will throw investors a curveball.

The thing to remember when all turns to panic (which it inevitably will) is that if we do indeed find ourselves in a new secular bull market, then the next cyclical bear should lead to a correction no bigger than roughly 30%.

That would mean the major breakout that the S&P 500 staged in spring 2013 when it broke past long-term highs around 1,550 could easily get retested at some point.

And if it does, just remember — the market always bounces back.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado`s Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year -- even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama`s administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.###1197||NEW YORK (AP) — Sitting in my suburban American kitchen, it is easy to feel that Saudi Arabia is a world away, that events...###1198||Beijing: China`s industrial output rose 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014 from a year earlier, missing market expectations, with growth in retail sales also weaker than expected, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

“Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival,” said Bananalink, a British-based group which works for more sustainable trade in bananas and pineapples.

The global banana market, worth $7 billion, is currently controlled by four multinationals, according to the United Nations: Chiquita, Fresh Del Monte, Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company and Fyffes.

Chiquita and Fyffes sell 180 million boxes of bananas a year between them, versus 117 million for Del Monte and 110 for Dole. The combined ChiquitaFyffes will have $4.6 billion in annual revenues and expects to make operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016.

“The first three (companies) on a global scale are not too far away from each other, whereas Fyffes was a good deal smaller. Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector,” said David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin.

The new firm will be listed in New York - though domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes - and have a market value of $1.1 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the combined company and Fyffes shareholders the remaining 49.3 percent, the companies said.

REGULATORY HURDLES

The deal will be subject to review by competition authorities but, Holohan added, is unlikely to prompt burdensome regulatory demands because the two companies operate mainly in separate North American and European markets.

Chiquita Chief Executive Ed Lonergan, who will be chairman of the combined company, was confident the match of the businesses would persuade regulators to give it the green light, with most of the savings expected in logistics.

“We looked at it and thought we could create a much stronger competitor,” Lonergan told Reuters. “The overlap between the businesses is de minimis.”

Fyffes shares leaped 44 percent on Monday, bringing the stock, which had traded at about 10 times earnings prior to the announcement, roughly into line with its peers

Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38 percent over its Friday’s closing price.

Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisers for Chiquita and its board and Lazard for Fyffes.

FAIR TRADE

Most bananas are grown for export on large plantations in Latin America and Africa and are from a single variety. This standardises taste and brings economies of scale but leaves the bananas vulnerable to diseases which can require extensive fungicide treatment, a potential hazard to local ecosystems.

Campaigners for sustainable farming expressed concern that the ChiquitaFyffes tie-up could intensify the economic pressure on small-scale banana producers, as well as environmental hazards.

“The banana market is dysfunctional and this merger feels like further proof,” said Michael Gidney, chief executive of British charity The Fairtrade Foundation.

“There’s downward pressure that’s creating a race for the bottom. The big producers are under pressure too - the banana business is not working for anybody.”###1200||Empty###1201||Empty###1202||Empty###1203||2.16pm GMT

US manufacturing output had its biggest increase in six months in February, increasing hopes that the world’s biggest economy is gaining momentum after bad weather disrupted business activity.

Factory production increased 0.8 percent last month, its largest increase since last August, the Federal Reserve said. Production fell 0.9 percent in January, the largest drop since May 2009.



New York also showed improving business conditions. The New York Fed said its “Empire State” index rose to 5.61 in March from 4.48 in February.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28.



The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.



Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.



On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.



Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.



The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.



News of the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology worried investors last week.



The loss-making solar cell and panel producer announced Wednesday that it would not be able to pay the interest on a loan. The interest payment of 89.8 million yuan was due on Friday.



The company became the first domestic company in the corporate bond market to default. It was seen as an indicator that more similar defaults may follow.



Despite the potential boost for stock markets from policy announcements at the ongoing annual two sessions - the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - investors remained cautious last week.



"Investors may be concerned about economic data, property and credit risks," said a research note sent by Shenyin & Wanguo Securities on Friday.

The investigators are reportedly examining how GM handled reports of faulty ignition switches, which were first revealed in 2004, and why the company did not react sooner to fix the problem, the New York Times reported Monday. The investigation will also address the question of whether GM tried to mislead federal regulators about the extent of its problems that led to the production of faulty switches, which reportedly caused cars to shut down unexpectedly and disabled the airbags.

“It’s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,” Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a private watchdog group said, according to the Times.

Detroit-based GM, which is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter, reportedly announced this week that Anton "Tony" Valukas, the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block will lead the internal probe, according to Reuters.

A Department of Transportation spokesman said in a statement, according to Reuters: "We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall."

The GM recalls involve six models that are not being currently produced -- 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices; and the 2007 Saturn Sky -- and the company could be charged up to $35 million in fines by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, if GM is found guilty of not reacting promptly to the complaints, Bloomberg reported.

The initial recall on Feb. 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s and widened to include a further 800,000 vehicles within the next two weeks.

GM stock plummeted 5.15 percent on Monday at close.

“The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share,” RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said, according to Reuters. “Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM.”###1212||Empty###1213||King Digital Entertainment Plc, the maker of hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month as the Irish company looks to take advantage of strong demand for technology investments.

The successful IPO of Twitter Inc in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's share price have fueled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including music-sharing service Spotify, lodging service AirBnB and payments company Square.

King should also get a boost in its U.S. initial public offering from a surge in shares of digital coupon company Coupons.com Inc after it went public on Friday. Shares of Coupons.com doubled after being priced above the company's planned IPO range.

King Digital said it expected to price its IPO of 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 per share. At the top of this range, the company would be valued at about $7.6 billion.

(Also see: Candy Crush Saga maker aims to raise $500 million in IPO)



The offering is scheduled to be priced on March 25 and the stock will start trading on March 26, two underwriters told Reuters.

The Dublin-based company will sell 15.5 million shares in the offering, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.

King is hoping to benefit from a shift towards mobile platforms, social networks and app stores. The company derived 73 percent of gross bookings from mobile users in the fourth quarter ended December 31.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day, the filing showed.

The King IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million at the top-end of the planned range. It filed for a $500 million placeholder in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing. CEO Riccardo Zacconi, who has led the company since it was founded in 2003 in Sweden, will have a 9.5 percent stake.

Candy Crush Saga, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and the year's top revenue-grossing app.

It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra lives.

King offers 180 games in 14 languages through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website, but is heavily reliant on Candy Crush, which brings in about three-quarters of its revenues.

The company said it has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING".

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.

JC Penney (JCP) has been down so long it's finally looking up, especially after a Citigroup upgrade today.

Citigroup's Oliver Chen and team explain why they raised their rating on JC Penney's shares:

We're upgrading [JC Penney] to Buy based on our conviction that [JC Penney] can continue to deliver positive comp store sales in-line with FY14 guidance (+MSD). We believe this can happen as [JC Penney] fixes home, focuses on restocking basics & private branded product, and edits out inappropriate merchandise. Achieving 1Q & FY guidance will mitigate investor fear on liquidity concerns and drive profitability and the stock higher. We acknowledge that [JC Penney] is early in this go-forward phase but we like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014. We believe 4Q's +2% comps on better conversion, transaction size, & units w/ high levels of customer service bodes well for con't momentum and share gains.

JC Penney wasn't the only retailer getting some love today: Macy's (M), was raised to Outperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo, while Aeropostale (ARO) was started as a Buy at Buckingham Research. Urban Outfitters (URBN), however, has dropped after making downbeat comments about the first quarter, while American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) has fallen after it offered disappointing guidance.

Shares of JC Penney have gained 8.5% to $9.13 at 10:22 a.m. today, while Macy's has risen 2.3% to $59.46 and Aeropostale is up 2.3% at $7.16. Urban Outfitters has fallen 4.3% to $35.88 and American Eagle Outfitters has dropped 6.5% to $13.27.###1215||Oil tanker heading back to Libya after capture by US forces

* Suggests government would allow further debt defaults

* Data points to marked slowdown in economy in Jan, Feb

* Analysts expect policy changes to support economy

* Some forecast central bank will cut bank reserves

By Benjamin Kang Lim and Kevin Yao

BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Li Keqiang warned on Thursday that the economy faces “severe challenges” in 2014 - comments that came as weak data fanned speculation the central bank would relax monetary policy to support stuttering growth.

Li, speaking at a news conference on the final day of China’s yearly parliament, hinted Beijing would tolerate slower economic expansion this year while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing longer-term and more sustainable growth.

Data released shortly after his comments suggested that tolerance may face an early test.

Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.

“A storm is coming,” said Gao Yuan, an analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai, while Hao Zhou, the China economist for ANZ said “policy easing should be imminent.”

But Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the statistical bureau, said China’s economic fundamentals remain sound despite experiencing some short-term pains from structural adjustments.

“The economy is likely to maintain steady and healthy growth in the future,” he was quoted by state radio as saying.

At the carefully orchestrated briefing where questions had to be vetted in advance, Li spent most time discussing the economy. But he also touched upon other topics, including friction in relations with Washington, corruption, pollution, and the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines aircraft.

While acknowledging the economy faced difficulties, Li suggested Beijing would not let growth slip too far. The government has targetted a rise of GDP in 2014 of 7.5 percent after actual growth last year of 7.7 percent.

“We believe we have the ability, and all the means, to ensure that economic growth will stay within a reasonable range this year,” he said.

He also signalled the government will allow further debt defaults after Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Co Ltd failed last Friday to pay an interest payment on its five-year bonds.

The first default on a domestic bond was hailed by experts as a landmark that will impose more market discipline, a break from the past when bonds enjoyed an implicit guarantee because the government would bail out troubled firms to ensure stability.

Growth in Chinese corporate debt has been unprecedented. A Thomson Reuters analysis of 945 listed medium and large non-financial firms showed total debt soared by more than 260 percent to 4.74 trillion yuan ($777.3 billion) between December 2008 and September 2013.

“We are reluctant to see defaults of financial products, but some cases are hard to avoid,” Li said. “We must enhance oversight and solve problems in a timely way to ensure no systemic and regional risks.”

Li said financial and fiscal reforms are among top priorities this year, reinforcing market expectations that long-awaited changes to liberalise bank deposit rates and efforts rein in local government debt could be in the pipeline.

Chinese leaders unveiled plans last year for sweeping reforms aimed at transforming the economy’s reliance on investment and exports, which have fuelled double-digit growth for three decades, to one that leans more on services and consumption. It included allowing market forces to play a bigger part in the economy.

PRIORITY ON JOBS

The signs of a slowdown in the economy this year have raised worries among some investors that China will miss the 7.5 percent growth target.

“The momentum is really quite weak,” Wei Yao, China economist for Societe Generale said after Thursday’s data. “Q1 GDP growth is probably already below 7.5 percent. The government will probably do some easing.”

Yao said she expected the central bank to reduce bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points. Major banks currently have to put aside a fifth of their cash as reserves and such a measure would represent the central bank’s strongest policy easing since 2012.

Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters earlier this week that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if economic growth slowed further. But they said policy action may only happen in the second quarter.

Li skillfully dodged a question on how far Beijing would let economic growth slip before it steps in with policy measures to support activity. Still, he hinted at tolerance for below-target growth, as long as enough new jobs are created.

“The GDP growth target is around 7.5 percent. ‘Around’ means there is some flexibility and we have some tolerance,” he said, adding that the lower limit on growth must ensure job creation.

Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said last week that China can slightly miss the 7.5 percent growth target as long as enough jobs are created.

However, Xu Shaoshi, the head of the pro-growth National Development and Reform Commission, said on Wednesday that the 7.5 percent target would be the lower limit for the government.

Beijing wants to create 10 million new jobs in 2014 and Li has said that the economy must grow 7.2 percent annually to do that. Some 13 million new jobs were created last year when the economy grew 7.7 percent.

Premier Li said the government will take a differentiated approach to cool the property market, rather than using one-size-fits-all policies used by his predecessors that have largely failed to calm real estate inflation.

“We need to apply differentiated property measures in different cities based on different types of demand and local conditions,” Li said.

But on government corruption, Li had an unequivocal answer.

“We will show zero tolerance for corrupt behaviour and corrupt officials. No matter who it is, or how senior their position, everyone is equal before the law,” Li said, without mentioning any names.

Speculation has gathered around China’s former domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang, who sources say is at the centre of a corruption investigation reaching into the highest echelons of government, though Beijing has yet to formally confirm this.###1218||Associated Press

NEW YORK — The company behind the addictive blockbuster game “Candy Crush Saga” believes it could raise nearly $613 million in an initial public offering.

In a regulatory filing Wednesday, King Digital Entertainment PLC said it plans to sell 15.3 million shares in the offering. Existing shareholders will sell an additional 6.7 million shares.

“Candy Crush” was the most downloaded free app on iPhones and iPads in 2013, beating Facebook, Google Maps and YouTube.

The shares are expected to be priced between $21 and $24, for a total of between $466.2 million and $532.8 million. Underwriters have the option of buying up to an additional 3.3 million shares. That could raise an additional $69.9 million to $79.9 million.

Shares would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KING.”



###1219||Vodafone Group continues to strengthen its fixed network holdings by acquiring Spanish cable operator Ono for €7.2 billion (US$10.1 billion).

Vodafone has money to spend after the sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless, and the acquisition of Ono comes as Vodafone last week said it would begin the integration of Kabel Deutschland on April 1. Vodafone bought the German cable operator for approximately €7.7 billion last year.

Vodafone sees the acquisitions of Ono and Kabel Deutschland as opportunities to combine mobile, fixed broadband and TV subscriptions. Also, demand for unified communications has increased significantly in Spain, and the combination of Ono's cable network and Vodafone's existing fiber-to-the-home network makes it more competitive, Vodafone said on Monday.

Ono covers about 7.2 million homes or approximately 41 percent of total homes in Spain, offering broadband speeds in excess of 200 Mbps (bits per second) and pay-TV services including TiVo. The network has been upgraded to DOCSIS 3.0, which means higher network speeds can be achieved at a relatively limited cost, according to Vodafone.

Vodafone said it expects Ono's management to stay on and become an "integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined business."

Like in the U.S., the telecom operator market in Europe is going through a shake-up.

French mobile and fixed-line operator SFR looks set to be acquired by international cable operator Altice, which already owns French ISP and cable TV company Numéricable. On Friday, SFR's owner Vivendi said it had decided to enter into exclusive negotiations with Altice for a period of three weeks.

The company's supervisory board had also considered an offer from SFR competitor Bouygues, but felt that was less attractive. A successful bid from Bouygues would reduce the number of mobile networks in France to three.

In addition, U.S. operator AT&T has been considering an acquisition of Vodafone, but at the end of January AT&T said it didn't intend to make an offer in the next six months. However, that could change overnight if someone else makes an offer.###1220||Empty###1221||Gold futures rose on Tuesday as market players weighed the prospect of Fed stimulus cuts against possible military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETF, rose yesterday to the highest level since December 20.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for settlement in April rose 0.13% to trade little changed at $1 343.30 per troy ounce by 07:50 GMT. Prices touched a session high at $1 344.10 per troy ounce, while day’s low was touched at $1 338.10 an ounce.

The precious metal capped a fifth weekly gain last week, jumping to more than 4-month high of $1 355.00 per troy ounce on March 3, as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated, spurring demand for haven assets, including gold.

Gold futures are up 11% this year and capped the first back-to-back monthly increase in February since the two-months through August, after a recent unrest in emerging markets, including Ukraine, and signs of slowing US growth, boosted demand for bullion as a store of value.

On March 3rd, pro-Russian forces seized control of the southern Ukraine’s Crimea region in what turns out to be the worst conflict between the West and Russia since the Cold War era. As Russia tightened its hold on the Ukrainian region, the later decided to begin military exercises, adding to the rising tension between the two countries.

“Gold looks like it’s stuck in range-trading,” said Mark To, head of research at Wing Fung Financial Group, a Hong Kong-based trader and refiner, cited by Bloomberg. “The market will look to data for clues whether the Federal Reserve will continue to taper, while tension between Russia and Ukraine will help keep prices supported”, To said in a report.

Fed stimulus outlook

Bullion prices were pressured yesterday after two Fed officials commented that the hurdle rate to alter the pace of Fed stimulus cuts was too high.

Fed President of Philadelphia Charles Plosser, who is a voting member this year, commented yesterday that the recent batch of strong US economic data wasn’t enough to alter the pace of the central bank asset purchases. His statement was later echoed by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who will not vote on policy this year.

“Given the fact that we’ve embarked on measured reductions, it’s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we’re doing,” Plosser said in a Bloomberg interview. “It’s OK to continue at 10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.”

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last month that central bank’s officials were “open to reconsidering” the pace of reductions in monthly bond purchase, should the economy falter, in contrast with her comments made earlier in February, that US economy has gained enough strength in order to withstand reduction of monetary stimulus.

At the same time, Fed officials will try to determine whether the weakness economy has recently demonstrated is due to temporary factors, before their next policy meeting scheduled for March 18-19th.

“Unseasonably cold weather has played some role,” Yellen said in her testimony in front of the Senate Banking Committee in February. “What we need to do, and will be doing in the weeks ahead, is to try to get a firmer handle on exactly how much of that set of soft data can be explained by weather and what portion, if any, is due to softer outlook.”

The central bank announced in December that it will pare monthly bond-buying purchases by $10 billion, after which it decided on another reduction of the same size at the meeting on policy in January, underscoring that labor market indicators, which “were mixed but on balance showed further improvement”, while nation’s economic growth has “picked up in recent quarters.”

Federal Reserve will probably continue to pare stimulus by $10 billion at each policy meeting before exiting the program in December, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 41 economists, conducted on January 10th.

Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETP, were increased to 812.70 tons on Monday, the strongest level since December 20th. Holdings in the fund are 0.9% up this year after it has lost 41% of its assets in 2013, that wiped almost $42 billion in value. A total of 553 tons has been withdrawn last year. Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson who holds the biggest stake in the SPDR Gold Trust told clients at the end of last year that he wouldn’t invest more money in his gold fund because it isn’t clear when inflation will accelerate. However, a government report revealed that the owner of the largest stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, kept his holdings unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2013.###1222||Empty###1223||* To end ticketing agreement effective Monday

* To also end reciprocal frequent-flyer program

* Merger with US Airways gives “greater connectivity” - spokesman

March 10 (Reuters) - American Airlines said it planned to end agreements covering ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs with JetBlue Airways after its merger with US Airways gave it “greater connectivity” along the U.S. East Coast.

American Airlines, which merged with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group Inc, had a so-called interline agreement with JetBlue that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other’s planes on one ticket.

New York-based JetBlue has 80 percent of its operations in the U.S. Northeast.

“Through the merger with US Airways, American’s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement,” American Airlines’ spokesman Casey Norton wrote in an email to Reuters.

Carriers enter into interline agreements because they allow them to offer more destinations without having to make large investments.

The partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have,” JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said at a JP Morgan conference in New York City on Monday.

JetBlue, which has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, also said it expected unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1-2 percent in the current quarter.

American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other from Monday, the companies said in a statement.

The carriers also said customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs would no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1.

The frequent-flyer program agreement between the two includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.

All American Airlines’ “AAdvantage” miles or JetBlue’s “TrueBlue” points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected, the carriers said.

American Airlines Group also said its February load factor, or percentage of seats sold, fell to 78.4 percent from 78.7 percent a year earlier.

American Airlines shares were down about 1 percent at $38.55 in early trading. JetBlue’s shares were down 0.55 percent.###1224||Empty###1225||The euro zone's annual rate of inflation was lower in February than first estimated, and fell back to the level reached in October 2013 that prompted the European Central Bank's last effort to stimulate growth.

The European Union's statistics agency Monday said consumer prices in the 18 nations that share the euro were 0.3% higher than in January, and 0.7% higher than in February 2013. Eurostat last month estimated that the annual rate of inflation was unchanged at 0.8% in February.

The revision means that inflation dropped further below the ECB's target of just under 2.0%, and to its lowest level since October of last year. Responding to that figure in early November, the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25% from 0.5%, its last policy move.

ECB policy makers have repeatedly said they don't expect outright declines in consumer prices, known as deflation. They reject comparisons with Japan, which struggled with deflation for two decades, saying the ECB has acted more decisively than Japan did in the 1990s and that European banks are stronger.

But they have acknowledged that very low rates of inflation are a worry, and in recent weeks have focused on the role of an appreciating euro in pressing down on import prices and activity.

ECB President Mario Draghi Thursday issued his strongest statement yet that the strong euro is pulling down inflation in the euro zone, making clear that the central bank is concerned that the appreciating euro could undermine the currency bloc's fragile recovery.

"The strengthening of the effective euro exchange over the past one-and-a-half years has certainly had a significant impact on our low rate of inflation and, given current levels of inflation, is therefore becoming increasingly relevant in our assessment of price stability," Mr. Draghi said.

The threat of widespread deflation in the currency area appears to be growing, with four members recording annual declines in consumer prices during February: Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovakia. A number of other members are close to that point, with Ireland and Spain recording annual inflation rates of just 0.1%, while in Slovenia the inflation rate was 0.2%, and in both the Netherlands and Italy it was 0.4%.

However, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the ECB's governing council have noted that some of the slowdown in the inflation rate is down to weaker global prices for energy, something over which they have little control. The rise in the core rate of inflation--which excludes volatile items such as energy and food--to 1.0% from 0.8% may reassure them that weak domestic demand is not the main cause of feeble prices rises.

Naturally then, the car is in need of bit of a revamp to match up with the times. Mercedes-Benz is onto just that with a facelifted version which is expected to debut at the 2014 Paris Motor Show.

Going by the spy images of the test mule dressed in light camouflage, Mercedes could be restricting the amount of updates to only the front and the rear-end of the upcoming B-Class. At the front, the MPV will feature a more upright grille and a redesigned bumper which could even get LED lamps. As for the rear, the only bit of update is the restyled exhaust pipe-end, also seen in the new C-Class.

Given that the existing B-Class is based on Mercedes’ MFA platform, it is advanced enough to call for any mechanical updates just yet. Nonetheless, Mercedes is expected to introduce a new 1.6-litre, 4-cylinder diesel engine to replace the existing Renault-sourced 1.5-litre unit.

The B-Class facelift is expected to debut at the 2014 Paris Motor Show, followed by a global launch later in the year. Mercedes-Benz India could consider bringing it here soon after its global launch to enhance the appeal of the B-Class which caters to a niche segment here in India.

Ananthalakshmi SINGAPORE, March 11 (Reuters) - Gold was steady near $1,340 an ounce on Tuesday as fears of an economic slowdown in China and Ukraine's geopolitical crisis keep investors seeking safe-haven bullion. In a sign of investor confidence in the precious metal amid global uncertainties, the world's biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday. Traders expect the metal to be well-supported between $1,330 and $1,350, with the next big movement expected from the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week. "Gold continues to be largely supported above $1,329, and while prices are unlikely to break above $1,361.60 in the absence of war, underlying support from the Ukrainian crisis ... is likely to keep prices elevated above $1,320 for an extended time," said Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures. Spot gold had inched up 0.3 percent to $1,342.60 an ounce by 0725 GMT. It ended flat on Monday after earlier dropping as much as 0.8 percent. Gold traders are watching developments in the Ukraine crisis, over which the West and Russia are facing their worst stand off since the Cold War. Weak Chinese exports data for February is also making investors opt for safe-haven gold rather than equities. SPDR Gold Trust said its holdings rose 7.50 tonnes to 812.70 tonnes on Monday - the biggest inflow since Feb. 13. "We will be trading sideways for a while as Ukraine tensions remain high and these renewed China fears are making people nervous," said a Singapore-based trader. "Markets are now looking at the Fed. It remains to be seen if the weather will have an impact on the Fed's stimulus outlook." The Fed holds its next policy meeting on March 18-19 at which it is most likely to announce another $10 billion cut to its bond-buying stimulus. Recent U.S. economic data has shown that growth has been hurt by severe cold weather. In the physical market, Chinese prices continued to trade at a discount to spot prices due to weak demand. Prices in Shanghai were at a discount of $3 an ounce to London prices, compared with a premium of over $20 at the beginning of the year. Among other precious metals, a public spat emerged on Monday between South Africa's labour mediator and the Chamber of Mines over the former's handling of talks to end an almost seven-week strike in the platinum sector, further dashing hopes of any breakthrough.

The Boeing 757 plane was carting 179 passengers and six crew members. It ultimately touched down safely at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

Safety officials are performing an inspection on the plane to determine why the panel blew off — a “highly unusual” occurrence, said Mr. Black, CNN reported.

LOS ANGELES — Herbalife is facing an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission.

The nutrition and supplement said Wednesday that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to comment.

Herbalife says it welcomes the inquiry, noting a “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business. The company says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulators and plans to cooperate fully.

The company announced this just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company. Ackman has repeatedly has bet against the company and repeatedly said he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme.

###1235||Empty###1236||WASHINGTON – More than 5 million people have now signed up for health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, thanks to a surge in enrollment over the past two weeks, the Obama administration announced Monday.

WASHINGTON – More than 5 million people have now signed up for health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, thanks to a surge in enrollment over the past two weeks, the Obama administration announced Monday.

The quickening pace of enrollment confirms that many Americans are using the new marketplaces as a March 31 deadline approaches for getting coverage this year.

The latest figures indicate that roughly 1 million people enrolled in the past two weeks, surpassing the total for all of February.

If the pace continues, the Obama administration may come close to registering 6 million people in the first year that Americans are able to get guaranteed health coverage under the health-care law.

That would still fall short of the goal of 7 million that administration officials had hoped to reach before the botched rollout of the law last fall.

How many people have paid for the health insurance plans they have selected remains uncertain.

Administration officials have not released data on payments. Unofficial estimates from insurance companies and some state-run marketplaces suggest that as many as 20 percent of enrollees in some markets have yet to pay their premiums, although some of those may not yet have been billed.

Nonetheless, 6 million enrollments would be an important accomplishment for the law’s supporters, who feared that the marketplaces might collapse after the disastrous launch of the federal HealthCare.gov website in October.

Drawing on the experience of previous government health programs, the administration and many outside experts had long predicted a rush to sign up for coverage in the final few weeks. In particular, they predicted that some groups, including young people and Latinos, whose participation in the marketplaces so far has lagged behind others’, increasingly would sign up as the deadline approached. The administration did not release a demographic breakdown for the latest enrollments.

The state-based marketplaces enable Americans who do not get health-care coverage through work to select among plans that offer at least a basic set of benefits. The plans cannot turn away sick people.

People who make less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $94,000 for a family of four, qualify for government subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums.###1237||The most camera-ready opponent of Comcast’s merger plans with Time Warner Cable — who, ironically, owes his big break to Comcast-owned NBC — went on CBS This Morning to again blast the proposed merger, saying “consumers will end up paying more, there will be less competition, there will be less innovation and, worse, even worse service.” Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) this morning said he sent out an email to his constituents to get their “feelings about what kind of service they get from Comcast” and whether they think the proposed deal “will be good.” “I got 60,000 responses, and believe me, people don’t like their service from Comcast, and they don’t think this deal is going to help them,” said Franken — who, before entering politics in a big way was a writer and performer on the now Comcast-owned NBC’s Saturday Night Live from its launch in the mid 1970s until 1980, returning in 1985 for another decade. Watch his appearance here:

Franken matters because he sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee which, later this month, will hold hearings on the reported $45 billion deal that would give Comcast 30 million subscribers in 43 of the nation’s top 50 markets — aka about 30% of pay TV customers. Franken reminded CBS This Morning anchors this morning he hadn’t been any too happy about the Comcast/NBCU merger either.

Franken laughed when CBS News’ Senior Business and Economics Correspondent Anthony Mason brought up Comcast’s argument that it and Time Warner Cable don’t overlap in markets, explaining, “I’m laughing because we’re supposed to take great comfort from the fact that this is the No. 1 cable company and the No. 2 and they don’t compete in any market, so they’re saying you should be happy that we have these monopolies and now we’re going to be one company with twice as much of a monopoly.”###1238||More press releases» Press Release Herbalife Comments On FTC Inquiry PR Newswire LOS ANGELES, March 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Herbalife (NYSE: HLF) announced it received today a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The Shanghai Composite index of stocks fell below the key level of 2,000 after investors reacted with shock to an 18pc slump in Chinese exports in February and to signs that credit is wilting again. Iron ore fell 8.3pc.

Fresh loans in China’s shadow banking system evaporated to almost nothing from $160bn in January, suggesting the clampdown on the $8 trillion sector is biting hard.

“It seems that rising default risk has started to erode Chinese investors’ confidence,” said Wei Yao, from Societe Generale. “Together with continued regulatory tightening on banks’ off-balance-sheet activity, we are certain this slowing credit trend has further to go and will inflict real pain on the economy.”

Japan’s economy is losing steam as the monetary stimulus from “Abenomics” wears off and the country braces itself for a rise in the consumption tax from 5pc to 8pc. Economic growth slumped from 4pc in early 2013 to 0.7pc in the fourth quarter, while the country racked up a record trade deficit.

The Economy Watchers Survey saw the steepest drop last month since the March 2011 tsunami and is now lower than when Abenomics began. Marcel Thieliant, from Capital Economics, said Japan faces a “sharp slowdown”.

The renewed jitters in China come after the authorities allowed solar company Chaori to default last week, the first ever failure in the country’s domestic bond market. The episode is a litmus test of President Xi Jinping’s new regime of market discipline, though the central bank has been careful to cushion the blow by engineering a fall in interbank interest rates. “Such adjustments are necessary for China in the long run, but are nothing if not risky in the short term,” said Ms Wei.

It is extremely hard to calibrate a soft landing of this kind, and the sheer scale of China’s credit boom now makes it a global headache. China accounts for half of all the $30 trillion increase in world debt over the past five years.

Zhiwei Zhang, from Nomura, said the central bank will be forced to loosen monetary policy this year with repeated cuts in the reserve asset ratio to head off a deeper slowdown.

Nomura said China’s $23bn trade deficit in February masks capital outflows, while data was in any case distorted by the Chinese New Year.

Even so, there are signs that deflationary forces are taking hold in China. Producer prices (PPI) fell by 2pc in February from a year earlier. Haibin Zhu, from JP Morgan, said it is “disturbing” the PPI index has been negative since November, a sign that China is struggling to cope with excess manufacturing plant.

China invested $5 trillion last year, as much as the US and Europe combined. There are already signs that the country is trying to export its over-capacity overseas by pushing down the yuan. If this amounts to a competitive devaluation policy, it risks sending a fresh deflationary impulse across the globe.###1243||J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) is still struggling, and losing market share to rivals. Imperial Capital analysts Mary Ross-Gilbert and Seweryn Sztalkoper said that the company’s remerchandised home department sales should rise this year. J.C. Penney’s revenues from home merchandise have declined from $3.19 billion in 2010 to about $950 million in 2013. That’s because the home departments in most of the big stores were closed. Even when the departments were reopened, they were poorly merchandised.

J.C. Penney’s guidance appears conservative

Imperial Capital analysts estimate J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s first quarter sales to rise 4.3%, and second quarter revenues to jump 6.4%. After recent discussions with the company management, Ross-Gilbert and Sztalkoper said that J.C. Penney’s incremental revenue opportunity could be as high as $400-$500 million this year. So, the comparable sales momentum is likely to improve in 2014 due to a jump in sales of home merchandise. Even a modest increase in sales across the rest of the store should offset the decline in revenue due to closure of 33 stores.

J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) forecasts its first quarter sales to grow between 3-5%, and full year revenues to increase in mid-single digits. That’s well below Imperial Capital’s estimate of 8.7% and 6.6% respectively. Lower Q1 guidance could be because of two reasons. One, harsh winter weather and storms caused temporary store closures, and kept consumers away. Two, not-so-high expectations from the home department. The analysts expect gross margins to rise 268 basis points to 34.5% in Q1. They forecast Q2 and Q3 gross margins to improve to 37.5% and 36.5% respectively.

J.C. Penney to survive in the long-term

Modestly positive comparable sales during the fourth quarter last year suggest that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s turnaround is gaining traction. The Plano, Texas-based company’s current cash position of $1.25 billion in cash and $500 million of revolver availability are sufficient to fund its turnaround plan. J.C. Penney also has the ability to tap into secured financing of $500 million. The research firm says that it expects J.C. Penney to survive in the long-term as a “value-priced’ department store chain serving low-income consumers.

Imperial Capital has a Buy rating on J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s longer-dated senior notes that mature between 2020 and 2097. But the research firm maintains Hold rating on shorter-dated senior notes that mature between 2015 and 2018. It has an Underperform rating on the company’s shares with $2.50 price target.

The move sent the Mumbai-based drug maker’s shares down 5% to Rs 574 on the BSE on Thursday.

After Ranbaxy Laboratories, Claris Lifesciences and Wockhardt, Sun Pharma has become the fourth Indian pharma company to face an import ban by the US regulator in the last decade in the backdrop of an intellectual property row between the two nations on use of patents for cheap drugs.

Ranbaxy, now controlled by Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo, is India’s largest drug maker by sales, while Sun Pharma is the leader in terms of market capitalization.

On Wednesday, a Sun Pharma facility was put on the FDA’s "red list", meaning its products can be detained in the US without physical examination. Usually, the reason cited for such a detention is the failure to adhere to good manufacturing practices but the FDA website notification that announced the import crackdown did not give reasons for the ban.

"This import alert was issued by the USFDA as a follow-up to the last inspection of the facility, during which some non-compliance of current good manufacturing practice regulations were identified," Sun Pharma said.

The company said that it has taken corrective steps to address the observations made by the regulator, adding the financial impact of the ban on the plant, which makes antibiotic cephalosporin, would be ‘negligible’.

"The contribution of this facility to Sun’s consolidated revenues is negligible," it said. The plant accounts for less than 1% of its consolidated revenues.

"The company has well diversified manufacturing infrastructure to cater to the US markets, which contribute 54% of its sales in financial year 2013," said said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, pharma analyst at Angel Broking.

Bank on Tuesday in a deal worth $1.8 billion, which satisfied both parties and ended nearly six months of hostilities between the two companies.

The battle over men’s clothing is finally over.

Men’s Wearhouse agreed to buy Maryland-based Jos. A. Bank on Tuesday in a deal worth $1.8 billion, ending nearly six months of public hostilities between the menswear retailers.

The combined company will become the country’s fourth-largest men’s retailer, with $3.5 billion a year in sales and more than 1,700 stores across the country, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank said in a joint statement. Jos. A. Bank’s brand will stay independent, they said.

Tuesday’s announcement comes a week after the retailers began negotiating and caps months of public bickering.

The companies, which have competed for budget-conscious customers for years, said Tuesday that they were better off working together. Jos. A. Bank is known for its frequent sales, including “Buy 1 Suit, Get 3 Free” offers, while Men’s Wearhouse promotes itself as a year-round low-cost alternative. Jos. A. Bank has said that customers were becoming immune to its promotions.

“They’re trying to kill each other by one-up promotions,” but that strategy couldn’t last, said Ronald Goodstein, an associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. The merger will allow them to cut costs and create a “mega-brand,” he said.

The tussle began in October, when Jos. A. Bank launched a hostile takeover bid of its larger rival. A month later, Men’s Wearhouse countered by offering to buy Jos. A. Bank. That bid was rejected. Meanwhile, Jos. A. Bank said it would acquire outdoor-wear maker Eddie Bauer. The move was a strategic one, industry observers say, designed to block Men’s Wearhouse’s takeover attempts unless it was given a better deal.

Men’s Wearhouse eventually upped its bid for Jos. A. Bank and the two entered into intense negotiations. In the end, Men’s Wearhouse increased its bid for Jos. A. Bank from $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion. As part of the deal, Jos. A. Bank said it will abandon its purchase of Eddie Bauer.

Both companies issued statements absent of any of the recent acrimony.

“We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers,” Doug Ewert, president and chief executive of Men’s Wearhouse, said in a statement.

“We look forward to working together with Men’s Wearhouse to ensure a smooth transition,” Robert Widrick, chairman of the board at Jos. A. Bank, said in a statement.

After the deal was announced, Men’s Wearhouse’s stock climbed 4.7 percent, to $57.14. Jos. A. Bank’s stock price rose 3.8 percent, to close at $64.22.

“Today was a grand-slam home run for the stockholders in both companies,” said Jerry Reisman, a mergers lawyer based in Garden City, N.Y.

Jos. A. Bank “will enable Men’s Wearhouse to go forward as a much stronger and more profitable company,” he said.

Joseph A. Bank, which was founded in Baltimore in 1905, has more than 600 stores. The companies did not announce whether any of those stores would close. Men’s Wearhouse, which is based in Fremont, Calif., has more than 1,000 stores across the United States and operates a separate brand in the United Kingdom.###1250||“Meet Viktor Yanukovych, who is running for the presidency of Ukraine.” Vladimir Putin and I were standing in his office at the presidential dacha in late 2004 when Yanukovych suddenly appeared from a back room. Putin wanted me to get the point. He’s my man, Ukraine is ours - and don’t forget it.

The “Ukrainian problem” has been brewing for some time between the West and Russia. Since Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, the United States and Europe have tried to convince Russia that the vast territory should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation that could chart its own course. Putin has never seen it that way. For him, Kiev’s movement toward the West is an affront to Russia in a zero-sum game for the loyalty of former territories of the empire. The invasion and possible annexation of Crimea on trumped-up concerns for its Russian-speaking population is his answer to us.

The immediate concern must be to show Russia that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Diplomatic isolation, asset freezes and travel bans against oligarchs are appropriate. The announcement of air defence exercises with the Baltic states and the movement of a US destroyer to the Black Sea bolster our allies, as does economic help for Ukraine’s embattled leaders, who must put aside their internal divisions and govern their country.

The longer-term task is to answer Putin’s statement about Europe’s post-Cold War future. He is saying that Ukraine will never be free to make its own choices - a message meant to reverberate in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states - and that Russia has special interests it will pursue at all costs. For Putin, the Cold War ended “tragically.” He will turn the clock back as far as intimidation through military power, economic leverage and Western inaction will allow.

After Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, the United States sent ships into the Black Sea, airlifted Georgian military forces from Iraq back to their home bases and sent humanitarian aid. Russia was denied its ultimate goal of overthrowing the democratically elected government, an admission made to me by the Russian foreign minister. The United States and Europe could agree on only a few actions to isolate Russia politically.

But even those modest steps did not hold. Despite Russia’s continued occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the diplomatic isolation waned and then the Obama administration’s “reset” led to an abrupt revision of plans to deploy missile defence components in the Czech Republic and Poland. Talk of Ukraine and Georgia’s future in Nato ceased. Moscow cheered.

This time has to be different. Putin is playing for the long haul, cleverly exploiting every opening he sees. So must we, practicing strategic patience if he is to be stopped. Moscow is not immune from pressure. This is not 1968, and Russia is not the Soviet Union. The Russians need foreign investment; oligarchs like travelling to Paris and London, and there are plenty of ill-gotten gains stored in bank accounts abroad; the syndicate that runs Russia cannot tolerate lower oil prices; neither can the Kremlin’s budget, which sustains subsidies toward constituencies that support Putin. Soon, North America’s bounty of oil and gas will swamp Moscow’s capacity. Authorising the Keystone XL pipeline and championing natural gas exports would signal that we intend to do precisely that. And Europe should finally diversify its energy supply and develop pipelines that do not run through Russia.

Many of Russia’s most productive people, particularly its well-educated youth, are alienated from the Kremlin. They know that their country should not be only an extractive industries giant. They want political and economic freedoms and the ability to innovate and create in today’s knowledge-based economy. We should reach out to Russian youth, especially students and young professionals, many of whom are studying in US universities and working in western firms. Democratic forces in Russia need to hear American support for their ambitions. They, not Putin, are Russia’s future.

Most important, the United States must restore its standing in the international community, which has been eroded by too many extended hands of friendship to our adversaries, sometimes at the expense of our friends. Continued inaction in Syria, which has strengthened Moscow’s hand in the Middle East, and signs that we are desperate for a nuclear agreement with Iran cannot be separated from Putin’s recent actions. Radically declining US defence budgets signal that we no longer have the will or intention to sustain global order, as does talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan whether the security situation warrants it or not. We must not fail, as we did in Iraq, to leave behind a residual presence. Anything less than the American military’s requirement for 10,000 troops will say that we are not serious about helping to stabilise that country.

The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous “norms of the international community.” Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as AlQaida reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar Al Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.

These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular US foreign policy: Countries are not trying to “balance” American power. They have come due to signals that we are exhausted and disinterested. The events in Ukraine should be a wake-up call to those on both sides of the aisle who believe that the United States should eschew the responsibilities of leadership. If it is not heeded, dictators and extremists across the globe will be emboldened. And we will pay a price as our interests and our values are trampled in their wake.

No one was hurt in the boarding operation late on Sunday, requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters southeast of Cyprus, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained" from the Libyan port of al-Sidra, his statement said.

Libyan rebels, who are calling for a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy, had managed to load crude oil onto the 37,000 tonne-tanker, which escaped the Libyan navy, embarrassing the weak central government and prompting parliament to vote the prime minister out of office.

The Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a US military escort. It was parked 29km southwest of Cyprus when the operation occurred around midnight Cyprus time.

The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.

Pyongyang had "cancelled and deleted" the ship's North Korean registry, as it violated its law "on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo".

The standoff over control of OPEC member Libya's oil is one facet of wider turmoil that has engulfed the vast North African country since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.

The government and nascent army have struggled to control brigades of former anti-Gaddafi fighters who have refused to disarm and have used their military muscle to make political demands on the state, often by targeting the vital oil sector.###1256||U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado John Walsh, center, said his office does not target individual pot users who smoke on private property during testimony Tuesday before the House Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations.###1257||Empty###1258||Empty###1259||The article you have been looking for has expired and is not longer available on our system.

The extension isn’t much of a surprise; in many ways, it was inevitable, given delays in other parts of the law and the controversy arising from the disconnect between the administration’s “If you like your health plan, you can keep it,” promise and the reality that the law’s provisions meant some people would have to switch plans.

Apart from the confusion, what does this extension really mean?

MORE: On eve of stress test, Fed asks banks for more info.

First, it’s important to realize what the extension does and does not do. It gives state insurance commissioners, who regulate the industry locally, flexibility; they can decide whether these non-compliant plans can continue to be offered. More than half, 27 states, have allowed insurers to continue offering these plans to consumers for the short term. While that might sound like a lot, the extension only applies to current policyholders — new customers cannot enroll in plans that don’t meet the ACA standards, which are designed to ensure consumers receive a minimum level of coverage.

It’s not that plan cancellations aren’t a big deal; they can be significant, particularly for those who lose their plan and have to purchase a new, more expensive one. Also, confusion over who can enroll and whether or not their states and their insurance company are offering an extension makes it all the more complex. But the extension does not spell doom for the ACA marketplaces.

At issue is how many people are affected overall, and what it does to the “risk pool” — that is, insurers’ ability to spread risk across higher- and lower-cost individuals in Obamacare’s marketplaces.

Rand Corporation researchers found that the current “optional extension” will likely lead to a small decrease in ACA-compliant plan enrollment and only a slight increase (about 1%) in ACA premiums.

MORE: Say goodbye to your supermarket

That suggests the Administration struck the right balance between allowing individuals to maintain noncompliant plans for a limited time and limiting coverage disruptions, and mitigating the potential for premium increases. (We should note that while 1% may seem slight, insurance companies had already priced their products for the new marketplaces, making the change unexpected and costly.)

Furthermore, a significant number of these plans would not meet the requirements and consumer protections at the heart of the Affordable Care Act, which begs the question of whether or not these were adequate plans for consumers to begin with.

Why wouldn’t allowing people to keep their current insurance have a greater impact on premiums and the success of the marketplaces as a whole? First, only existing customers can keep their policies, so the extension applies to a limited, and shrinking, number of people. Second, not all states have chosen to allow continuation of plans that don’t meet the new standards (and even where they do extend, insurers do not have to comply). Third, there has always been substantial turnover in the individual market because these plans typically serve as transitional coverage as people move between jobs or other forms of coverage, which means that most individual policyholders do not keep the same policy for more than a couple of years and will gradually transition into new plans that meet the ACA requirements even with the extension.

MORE: A lazy, expensive way to intimidate shareholders

In the larger scheme of things, this particular policy change is a reasonable course-correction to help smooth full implementation. These types of adjustments are not unusual in the implementation of any law, but because the ACA is larger and more controversial, there are more of them.

While these changes receive a lot of political and media attention, it would be wiser to concentrate on making sure that all individuals have access to affordable health coverage that meets the essential benefit needs of all Americans.

Ben Broadbent becomes dep gov for monetary policy effective July 1

Nehmat Shafik dep gov responsible for markets and banking effective August 1

Both will sit on the MPC with Shafik taking the place of Paul Fisher. Shafik will also attend FPC meetings

Shafik has been Deputy MD of the IMF since April 2011 where she oversees work on countries in Europe and the Middle East. She is also responsible for the IMF’s $1 billion administrative budget, human resources for its 3,000 staff and oversees the IMF’s training and technical assistance for policy makers around the world.

The BBC sums it up here

This from the BOE

As the Bank’s Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, Dr Broadbent will have specific responsibility for the Bank’s research and analysis of the UK economy in support of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decisions, and for the provision and distribution of bank notes that are secure against the threat of counterfeiting. Dr Broadbent will sit on the Bank’s Court of Directors, the Monetary Policy Committee, and the Financial Policy Committee. He is also responsible for chairing MPC in the event of the Governor’s absence.

As Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, reporting directly to the Governor, Dr Shafik will provide greater focus at the very top of the Bank on these two core policy areas. Dr Shafik will be appointed by the Governor to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) under Section 13(3)(b) of the Bank of England Act 1998 as ‘the person who has executive responsibility within the bank for monetary policy operations’, filling the seat currently held by Paul Fisher, the Bank’s Executive Director for Markets. The Government has indicated its intention to place this appointment on a statutory basis in due course. Once formalised, Dr Shafik will hold seats on the MPC, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), and the Bank’s Court of Directors. In addition, the Court of the Bank will appoint the Dr Shafik to the Board of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Dr Shafik will therefore join the Governor and the Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe, as a member of all three main policy committees.

In her role as Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, Dr Shafik will be responsible for reshaping the Bank’s operations and balance sheet, including ensuring robust risk management practices and helping to lead the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing by the MPC. She will also oversee the implementation of reforms to the Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework, lead the Bank’s work to build fair, efficient and effective financial markets, and review and strengthen the Bank’s Markets and Banking areas, including a comprehensive review of the Bank’s essential market intelligence function.

Dr Shafik will also be jointly responsible for the Bank’s international surveillance, analysis and engagement.

The New York Times published an extensive report about hedge fund manager Bill Ackman's war against Herbalife, a multi-level marketing nutrition company he believes is a "pyramid scheme."

Part of Ackman's strategy is lobbying in order to bring about an investigation that shut down Herbalife. One way Ackman's team has been doing this is organizing letter-writing campaigns, the report said.

In regards to the letters, the Times points out that the language in many of them is so similar that it makes it clear they were written as part of a coordinated lobbying effort.

The New York Times posted a cache of more than a hundred documents, including some of the letters. The Times was able to get in touch with some of the authors and the letters look pretty bad after they admitted that they didn't remember writing a letter.

Here are two examples:

The author of the letter below is a Puerto Rican hairstylist from Connecticut. Israel Alvarez didn't really know what Herbalife was when the New York Times asked him about it. He said it was "a vitamin, and a food thing."

Cesar Jara, who runs a car repair shop, didn't even know what his letter to the FTC said. "What did the letter say, that I used Herbalife and I am happy with it or not happy with it?" he asked the Times.

Other folks with similar letters didn't respond to the NYTimes request for comment, the report said.

So far, Ackman has suffered about $500 million in paper losses on his bet. Still, he has maintained that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure.

NEW YORK/LONDON: Gold tumbled one per cent last Friday after data showed US job growth accelerated sharply, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

Bullion pared some early losses after benchmark 10-year Treasury yields gave back some gains after initially rising to a six-week high. Weaker US equities after early advances also helped lift gold from its lows.

Employers added 175,000 jobs to their payrolls last month up from January’s 129,000 new positions, the Labour Department said. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 6.7 per cent from a five-year low of 6.6 per cent, as US citizens flooded into the labour market to search for work.

“It’s a decent data point but who knows how valid it is because of the weather and so forth,” said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of California-based Merk Funds, which has more than US$400 million in currency mutual fund assets.

“Ultimately, the Fed is not interested in tightening any time soon because Yellen says she doesn’t think inflation is a problem,” which boosts gold’s appeal as a hedge, he said.

Spot gold fell as much as 1.5 per cent to a session low of US$1,329.35 an ounce, and was last trading down one per cent at US$1,337.19.

US COMEX gold futures for April delivery fell US$14 to US$1,337.80 an ounce, with trading volume about 20 per cent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.

The metal, seen as a safe haven, was still on track for a fifth straight week of gains, capitalising on gains made earlier in the week when tensions in Ukraine escalated.

“In the short term, given the better-than-expected data, and provided nothing happens in Ukraine over the weekend, gold could fall below US$1,330,” VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said.

On Friday, President Vladimir Putin rebuffed a warning from US President Barack Obama over Moscow’s military intervention in Crimea, saying that Russia could not ignore calls for help from Russian speakers in Ukraine.

Rather, sales from Urban brands Anthropologie and Free People helped reverse the losses posted by the 230 Urban Outfitters stores in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Urban Outfitters reported $905 million in fourth quarter fiscal 2014 revenue, a miss over the $910 million the Street was expecting but a 6% increase over the $856 million in revenue reported for the same quarter last year. The company's fourth quarter net income came in at $88.6 million, resulting in earnings of 59 cents per share -- a figure that both beat the analyst consensus of 55 cents per share and marks a three-cent improvement over earnings from the prior-year period.

On a full-year basis, Urban's revenue increased 10% to $3.1 billion, with net income coming in at $282.3 million. Full-year earnings came in at $1.89 per share, up from $1.62 in earnings per share during fiscal 2013.

"I am pleased to announce that Urban produced record earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending January 31, 2014," Richard Hayne, Urban CEO, said in a statement Monday afternoon. "Looking forward, customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at our Anthropologie and Free People brands have been strong, but given the continued challenges facing the Urban Outfitters brand, we remain very cautious about Urban's first quarter performance," he added.

Indeed, despite its name, the Urban Outfitters brand is the weakest of Urban's bunch: it posted $398 in fourth quarter revenue, a 9% decline over the same quarter in 2013. Free People and Anthropologie, meanwhile, saw their sales increase 20% and 10%, respectively. On a full-year basis, Anthropologie and Free People brought in $1.68 billion of Urban's $3.1 billion full-year revenue.

During Urban's fiscal 2014, the company opened 38 new stores including 16 Urban Outfitters stores, 13 Free People stores and 9 Anthropologie stores. It closed one Urban Outfitters location and 2 Anthropologie stores due to lease expirations.

Urban stock waffled in after-hours trading following the release of the earnings report: at first it ticked up 1.2%, then fell 1.4%, then went back into positive territory for a gain of 0.72%. The stock is currently trading at $37.66, for a gain of 0.4%. Year-over-year, the stock is down 9.5%, but if the company is able to turn around its namesake brand, the stock could surge: in January, in fact, a Jefferies analyst gave the retailer a $54 price target, saying that if the Urban and Anthropologie brands can hum along together, the stock should surge.###1270||It's been a little more than 100 years since this country witnessed an accumulation of economic power to rival what Comcast is assembling. Like the Gilded Age magnates who controlled oil and refining and leveraged their product with railroads, Comcast, the country's largest cable company, is building a cash-generating machine that controls every aspect of its business.

In the 1890s and early 1900s, the Gilded Age magnates took advantage of the laissez-faire philosophy of the time. Today, even though there are in theory more safeguards, regulations, and guidelines to prevent such industrial consolidation, no one is even suggesting that they be used, certainly not to an extent that will prevent a lot of damage. The prevailing view of what constitutes an abuse of power is too weak – and so are potential protections against such abuse.

Much of the news in the internet world has been taken up by the possible consequences of Comcast's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable system. But the issues extend well beyond this deal. There's also the recent Supreme Court decision that gives Comcast complete control over its TV channel lineup. And there's the news that Netflix has decided to connect its broadband distribution to Comcast, paying for the privilege. Together, they portend a truly frightening future for both television and the internet.

#### Art Brodsky ##### About Art Brodsky is a veteran journalist and advocate in Internet and telecommunications issues. He is now a communications consultant.

Controlling the Channels ————————

Let's start with the cable TV network, the core of Comcast's business and the most pedestrian contrasted with the relative flash of high-speed Internet access. On February 24, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Tennis Channel's final legal gasp on a complaint against Comcast that was filed in 2010. That year, the Tennis Channel went to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and claimed discrimination because Comcast put the channel on a pay tier, where it would have fewer viewers, and thus a lower advertising base, than if it were on basic cable like the Golf Channel, which Comcast owns.

At the FCC, an administrative judge held extensive hearings and decided for Tennis Channel. The relevant FCC bureau held for Tennis Channel. And the Commission itself decided for Tennis Channel. Then Comcast went to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which more often than not takes the opportunity to knock around the FCC. The Appeals Court reversed the FCC, finding that Tennis Channel's placement on a different programming tier wouldn't benefit Comcast. No harm (to Comcast at least), no foul.

There are a couple of lessons to take from the Tennis Channel experience that bear on the bigger picture. First, Comcast now has legal carte blanche to do whatever it wants on its channel lineup, including discriminating against independent programmers. That means if you want to start a channel on the country's biggest cable operator, you may have to agree to some special conditions, maybe even take on Comcast as an "investor."

Second, the more universal lesson that that small businesses are out there on their own. The government and its laws which exist in theory to protect them are, in practice, useless. Tennis Channel probably spent millions in legal fees, won every round they were supposed to win, and then lost. There is a reason only two complaints have been filed against Comcast. The other was from Bloomberg, which has deeper pockets than Comcast. Bloomberg wants its financial news channel to be put in the same "neighborhood" as other news channels like CNBC and MSNBC, which Comcast owns. Bloomberg thought that the wording of one of the conditions on which Comcast was able to gobble up NBC-Universal required a channel switch immediately. Bloomberg spent millions litigating the word "now" before the FCC agreed with the company, three years after Bloomberg filed its complaint. The matter is now pending in a Federal appeals court

These cases are the reasons that whenever anyone talks about putting conditions on an FCC-approved deal, they are basically wishing out loud. Big companies have more money and lawyers and will make mincemeat out of conditions, throwing more into it than most mortal companies can afford. Conditions only work when they are enforced, which is rarely. Senator Al Franken (D-MN) listed some of the conditions and lack of enforcement in a letter to the FCC. Conditions are window dressing.

Expanding the Empire ——————–

Once the channel guide is set, then the question becomes: who will get the service? The answer shows the utter futility of modern anti-trust law. The largest cable company, Comcast, wants to pay $45 billion to buy the second-largest, Time-Warner Cable. The combined company would span 70 million subscribers – about 40 percent of all broadband subscribers and 30 percent or so of cable subscribers – and it would have access to 19 out of the country's top 20 markets, including New York and Los Angeles, where Time Warner is the local cable company. However, the companies don't compete directly because each has its own service territory, and so it would be hard to say there would be lessened competition. That's the argument Comcast executives make to justify the deal.

That's also the theory that allowed telephone companies created after the breakup of AT&T to reassemble most of AT&T in two existing companies, except stronger than the old Ma Bell because of the profit-engine of wireless services. What the theory ignores is the enormous market power of a company with 30 million subscribers stretching across the country. The problem is acute for broadcasters. They have to negotiate terms with cable companies to get their channels on cable systems. When there is an impasse, and there have been many, the cable system simply drops the TV network until there's agreement. With Comcast in all but one of the top markets, its power to force terms on broadcasters will be considerable. There will be disruptions in ad sales as well.

The "competition" for wired Internet access has been over for a while, as Verizon and Comcast cut a deal. Comcast ditched plans to get into the wireless business and will sell Verizon wireless to customers. Verizon, in areas that don't have FiOS, will recommend Comcast broadband. Will that continue in territories now served by Time Warner that would be gathered into the Comcast empire, like, say, New York City? Say what you will about wireless, it's still not as robust a service as wired broadband services are.

That leads to the last building block.

The Toll Plaza ————–

This is where the deal between Netflix and Comcast comes in. Comcast now will determine which program providers, like Netflix, have the privilege of paying extra to provide content their customers want. Big companies like Netflix, or other video providers, can afford those direct connections. Smaller, newer services can't, and their growth will suffer.

The timing and the framing of the deal lead to any number of questions, but the conclusions seem fairly clear. First, look at the circumstances. For some reason, in the months prior to the deal, Netflix customers on Comcast and Verizon's networks had been experiencing some very serious service issues. There can be many reasons for the degradation of picture or more frequent buffering, but remember on basic fact: consumers have paid for Netflix content twice already. They (we) pay once for the broadband service and another time for a Netflix subscription.

Every bit that goes over the network has been requested by a customer. This isn't Netflix pushing traffic. It's Netflix responding to customer demand. If you look at it that way, then the "agreement" between Netflix and Comcast becomes a little more interesting. Netflix will pay Comcast an undisclosed amount of money to connect directly to Comcast's network, but Netflix will not get "preferential treatment" from Comcast. On the other hand, it may be that Netflix's service problems will magically improve as a result of the payments to Comcast.

Verizon will be next to charge Netflix for the privilege of delivering movies and TV shows customers wanted.

The End Result ————–

The one company that may truly know what's going on is Cogent, the Internet access carrier which had been carrying Netflix traffic. Cogent CEO Dave Schaeffer has said Comcast and Verizon aren't investing in creating more capacity for exchanging traffic. His larger point, however, is that companies which can't afford to pay whatever Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T want for non-prioritizing direct connections will have their traffic degraded.

If Comcast buys Time Warner, the toll gate gets much larger, encompassing not only Comcast's 22 million customers but Time Warner's eight million (after Comcast ritual of discarding three million) in the largest markets. As it is, Schaeffer said, Netflix is paying a lot to connect to one cable company.

The sum of those Comcast actions is pretty impressive. They can discriminate among programmers on their cable networks, expand their market of those networks to millions more people, and can charge Internet commerce companies for direct access to their newly enlarged service territory.

Once upon a time, government agencies might have been interested in such things. But with the narrow definitions of anti-trust hobbling the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission having given away (so far) its authority over broadband and Congress more in the thrall of large companies, it's almost a certainty that consumers will get the short end of the stick, again.###1271||Press TV has conducted an interview with Geoffrey Steinberg, with the Executive Intelligence Review from Washington D.C., to shed more light on the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine.

- Geoffrey Steinberg, there seems to be some challenges in definition when it comes to Ukraine, in particular Crimea, of what is legal and what is not.

Why do not you review, if you can, the situation there because as of now we are looking at 10 days from now that this referendum is going to take place.

Of course you have the interim government there, saying that this is illegal and of course you have Crimea along with Russia saying that Crimea wants to join the Russian Federation.

- Well, I think that you have to go back one step and raise the question of whether or not the current government in Kiev is, in fact, legal.

If you go back to the last week of February when you had three European Union foreign ministers going to Kiev and joined by an emissary from Russia as well, an agreement was reached to, basically, establish an interim government with President Yanukovych still in and with a number of issues to be handled through diplomatic means and then you had violent protesters in the Maidan including people who are associated with some organizations that can be fairly called neo-Nazi, who used force including activating sniper attacks against both police and other demonstrators to, basically, affect a change in government through military force in violation of the very agreement that Yanukovych and the three opposition party heads and the European foreign ministers had all signed.

So if you do not look at those events first, it is really not fair to evaluate the events in Crimea as if they were the starting point of the crisis in Ukraine.

Remember again that this all began were protests were activated against Yanukovych when he refused, back in November, to sign the European Union Eastern Alliance Partnership Agreement, which was quite frankly a bad deal from the standpoint of Ukrainian sovereign interest including severe economic problems that would have been precipitated had they gone along and signed that.

So this is not a simple...issue and you cannot selectively pick something that has occurred ....into the process and declare that that is illegal when the whole character of the current Kiev government violates the international law because a legitimately elected, undisputed legitimately elected government was overthrown by violence.

So unless there is a willingness to step back and look at the whole picture, I see this going in a very dangerous direction, possibly even leading to a war confrontation between NATO and Russia, which would be horrific.

- Perhaps you are not also aware, as I think, as I gather from Peter Sinnott, that the EU has come out and they have announced what they have called these sanctions, this is pretty much a threatening sanction, as they called it. They are going to target Russian officials, visa bans; they have joined the United States on that. This was the result of the meeting that took place in Brussels. It also has threatened, and I underline the word threatened, about the broad range of economic sanctions should Russia embark on further steps to destabilize Ukraine.

How did that happen? I was having the impression that the EU was pretty much, as our guest there said, economically somewhat obviously reliant on Russia and of course the big question about gas comes into play here, of the amount of gas that Russia provides the EU countries with.

- Well, first of all I think that Peter (Sinnott) is right that left to their own devices, the European Union would very much like to, number one: avoid being drawn into major economic sanctions against Russia because quite frankly the Russian have a lot of economic leverage.

The City of London handles a great deal of Russian money, both oligarchical money and Russian state funds and those banks are not in a very good shape and a sanctions regime which cut off the flow of those funds into the City of London and the other financial centers in Europe, could have a tremendously disastrous impact because, frankly, the European banking and financial system is on a very weak ground.

Secondly, Secretary Kerry was just in Kiev and he announced that the US is prepared to give a billion dollars in loan guarantees to Ukraine and it is already widely acknowledged that most of that money is likely to go to Russia in the form of payments for the increased cost of Russian natural gas to Ukraine because the especial discount prices, negotiated between Putin and Yanukovych, are going to be cut off in April.

Yesterday the Russians also announced that they were going to hold off on deliveries of fuel for nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and Ukraine because of the “security situation” and Ukraine has 15 nuclear power plants that get most of their reprocessed fuel from Russia.

So, I think that if we get into the game of the economic warfare it is very questionable who is going to come out on top. I think that the Europeans...

- We are in the middle of it. The US has come out and announced these sanctions. The other ones being threats of, as I mentioned, targeted sanctions as well as a broad range of economic measures.

They have not announced specifically what those may be; so we are on that road, we are there. So what is going to happen?

- Well, let me just finish my thought. The US carries a great deal of leverage with the Europeans and I am sure that various US officials, if not Secretary Kerry, then certainly National Security Advisor Rice and others, were working the phones, maybe even President Obama himself; so that the gap between the European action and the US action was as narrowed as possible.

Until we see the content of the sanctions coming from the Europeans, one has to reserve judgment and say: well, there are sanctions in name and there are sanctions in deed, and it remains to be seen just how far this is going to go.

Again, I just want to say that there is just a much bigger threat issue here, namely that if NATO winds up on the border of Russia, with Ukraine being fast-tracked into not just the EU but NATO with the plans now even to possibly deploy missile defense systems into Ukraine, that has been muted in the last 24 hours, we could be dealing with a much greater strategic crisis and conflict than one having to do with economic ties and sanctions and the war danger implicit in this, has been described by some people as a kind of reverse Cuban missile crisis that could bring us to the brink of the kind of the confrontation that I do not think anybody’s interests are served by pushing that button.

- Geoffrey Steinberg, you seem to think that the bigger picture is about this, perhaps, military type of confrontation that may occur but, you know, maybe we do not have to go that far back; just a few days ago when Putin actually did issue a threat, this was against the US in that famous press conference that he had at his home outside of Moscow. He said, and this was in reference to the US, I think obviously now with the development of the EU coming and imposing sanctions; he said: If the US imposes sanctions on Russia, we may start using the Dollar for international transactions and an attempt to announce sanctions would end in a crash for the financial system of the United States, which would cause the end of the domination of the United States in the global financial system.

Do you think that Putin would go through with that?

- Well, I think that regardless of Russian actions, that the transatlantic financial system is on an extremely shaky ground, to begin with; and I do not think that Russia is the decisive or determinant factor in that.

European banks are going through stress tests and probably about a third of the major European banks, the systemically significant banks, are going to be failing those tests. They are undercapitalized, the EU is under enormous pressure of the ECB to do a quantitative easing policy like the Fed.

The Fed in the United States is now sitting on a portfolio of overvalued security assets in the range of two to three trillion dollars; that has never happened before. So I think that we are on a fragile ground to begin with.

So I think that the economic problems are there regardless of whether we get into a kind of a pissing contest of back and forth sanctions with Russia threatening to step away from the Dollar role as a world reserve currency.

Sergey Glazyev made statements in that general direction over the last few days as well. He is the head of the Customs Union; but I think that the weakness of Europe, as Peter (Sinnott) indicated, there was no impulse towards a Marshall Plan.

Yanukovych, in the closing days of negotiations around the Eastern Partnership, said that Ukraine would need 14 billion Euros a year in investment for an undisclosed number of years to rebuild the economy up to a level to be competitive with European Union standards...###1272||Empty###1273||Empty###1274||###1275||



SHANGHAI: Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a US initial public offering that could value the firm at around US$140bil.

In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor.

The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over US$300bil in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.

China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the No 2 e-commerce player, JD.com.

An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.

"In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it – it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops," said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now.

Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.

Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the US – potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company – which could surpass the US$16bil raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.

Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1% of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1% a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.

Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week.

PEELING AWAY

Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a US$1.5bil IPO of its own in the US, are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.

Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.

"We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall," said Wang.

Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.

"As a mature Internet brand, we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers," Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. "We go and sell our products where the consumers are."

RIVALS RISING

Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba – and ambitious.

JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14% market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent – a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost US$150bil by market value – will give it new financial and operational resources.

Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in "the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.

As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.

"I am leaning towards specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster," said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. "It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."

Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145% in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.

Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.

Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.

MA VS MA

Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma – a namesake but unrelated.

Rhetoric from the two Internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.

When Tencent launched a "red envelope" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a "Pearl Harbour attack" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.

Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a US$500mil US IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.

WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba.

In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a "killer weapon" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.

China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.

"The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector," said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.

"Firms are all lining up – the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba – and the camps are forming," said Zhang. – Reuters



###1276||HONG KONG — One of the surest bets on China is starting to look a bit shaky.

For the past nine years, each business day at 9 in the morning, government workers in the blandly named Building No. 30 in Shanghai’s Pudong financial district have published a benchmark number that tells the world what their country’s currency will be worth that day, compared with the US dollar.

More often than not, the staff of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System has assigned a value to the currency, the renminbi, slightly stronger than it had finished the previous day. Thanks to the guiding hand of the Chinese state, the renminbi today is about 25 percent stronger than it was in July 2005, when China scrapped the currency’s fixed peg to the dollar in favor of a steady, crawling appreciation.

But recent developments suggest such strengthening is no longer the certainty it once appeared to be, and Beijing is taking pains to show that China’s currency is not just a one-way bet. This year, the renminbi has reversed course, weakening 1.6 percent against the dollar. And Saturday, the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, said that beginning Monday, it would allow the currency to climb or fall as much as 2 percent per day against the dollar, compared with 1 percent previously.

Widening the trading band “will further drive away speculators betting on a one-way appreciation of the Chinese yuan, thanks to the possible bigger and more frequent exchange rate fluctuations,” Tan Yaling, president of the China Forex Investment Research Institute, told Xinhua, the state-run news agency, on Sunday.

Yuan is another name for the renminbi.

This newfound volatility and uncertainty over the currency are just one area where, despite recent economic data suggesting that growth is decelerating to its slowest pace in over a decade, China is pushing ahead with a campaign of wide-ranging financial overhauls. If carried out, they are likely to redefine the nation’s state-driven growth model and to reverberate in economies far beyond China’s borders.

Freeing up interest rates, internationalizing the currency, and modernizing the financial system are all on the agenda.

On Thursday, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, said the government’s top priority for the year was to push ahead with financial overhauls. Economic growth could come in above or below the official target of 7.5 percent, he said, which would represent a slowdown from the 7.7 percent rise in gross domestic product last year.

Regardless of this, China will “carry out the reforms without hesitation,” Li pledged, adding a warning that “in the course of reforms, the vested interests will be shaken and some people’s cheese will be moved.”

A key risk for companies and countries that do business with China is not that Beijing will balk at restructuring its economy if growth slows beyond a certain point; it is that policy makers will stay the course.

Over the years, China’s investors and trade partners have come to rely on what amounts to a “Beijing put,” an option that provides assurance that a minimum level of growth will be attained. When the country looked set to fall short of this level, the government would intervene to prime the pumps — freeing up credit, introducing subsidies, and otherwise ensuring that China avoided any real economic pain and remained on track as the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

Yet in the face of apparently slowing growth, this implicit guarantee is showing signs of unraveling. Markets around the world are getting spooked, from Australian iron ore miners to the luxury fashion houses of Europe to US scrap exporters.

This month, a small producer of solar panels based in Shanghai failed to pay the interest on a bond worth $163 million. It was the first default in China’s onshore corporate bond market in recent history, and it sent shock waves through global copper markets.

Investors are worried that Chinese buyers who imported copper purely for financing purposes could be forced to sell, and prices of the metal have plummeted on fears that hundreds of thousands of tons of copper could begin to flood global markets as a result.

So far, the Chinese leadership is showing no signs that it shares these fears. Indeed, analysts have said that allowing a struggling company to default instead of rushing in with a government bailout is a necessary form of near-term pain if China’s 8.5 trillion renminbi corporate bond market is to mature and develop over the long term.

Still, policy makers made it clear that by stepping back from the market, the government was not stepping out of the picture entirely.

“Market participants should view fluctuations in the exchange rate rationally and respond proactively,” China’s central bank said in a statement posted on its website Saturday. “Of course, if the exchange rate sees large or abnormal swings, the central bank will carry out the necessary adjustments and supervision in order to protect the normal floating exchange rate of the renminbi.”###1277||(Photo for representational purpose only)

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has imposed a ban on imports from generic drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' plant at Karkhadi in Gujarat, in the latest quality blow for India's drug sector.

The Karkhadi plant makes both drug ingredients and formulations, according to Sun's 2013 annual report.

An "import alert" results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices, according to the FDA website.

Sun Pharma, India's biggest drugmaker by value, saw its shares fall as much as 6.4 per cent on Thursday after the FDA's "import alert", which appeared on Wednesday on the agency's website.

A spokesman for Sun was not available for comment.

The FDA action against Sun Pharma comes amid a rash of regulatory sanctions against Indian generic makers in the last year, triggering concerns about the quality of the medicines supplied by India's $14 billion drug industry to countries including the United States, the biggest market.

USFDA has banned all the India plants of Ranbaxy Laboratories, India's No.1 drugmaker by sales, due to lapses in production quality. Rival Wockhardt has also been barred by regulators from exporting drugs from some of its plants to the United States and the United Kingdom.

India is second only to Canada as a drug exporter to the United States, where it supplies about 40 per cent of generic and over-the-counter drugs.

(Reuters)###1278||European car sales are revving up, yet another sign that the region’s economy is steadily recovering. Passenger car registrations in the EU rose by 8% in February, the sixth consecutive monthly increase, according to data released today.

The standout performer was Portugal, where February auto sales surged by 40%. Sales from Spain to Sweden to Slovakia also recorded double-digit percentage gains.

But as with so many other indicators, the news from France bucks the overall positive trend. France’s February sales were the weakest in the EU, falling even faster than in the shell-shocked Cypriot economy, where capital controls make big-ticket purchases, like cars, difficult. France’s largest domestic carmaker, PSA Peugeot Citroën, saw February sales rise by nearly 4%, but it continues to lose market share to rivals that are boosting sales even faster.

In recent months, gaudy growth figures, such as the ones published today, have reflected the low bases for comparison as much as genuinely strong economies. As the chart below shows, in many countries new car sales are still far below what they were in the same period in 2008, a high-water mark just before the financial crisis hit. In only a handful of smaller EU members have they surpassed pre-crisis levels.###1279||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

The Wall Street Journal reported today that the valuation would put King in the big leagues with a valuation rivaling the top video game companies on the market.

Of course King.com has had some negative publicity lately with their attempts to trademark Candy and Saga. Smaller game makers and gamers alike have expressed their displeasure with the company.

From the Wall Street Journal:

King Digital Entertainment PLC, maker of the wildly popular “Candy Crush Saga” game, is targeting a market value of $7.6 billion for its initial public offering set for later this month, a price that would put it in the same league as the world’s leading videogame makers. The Anglo-Swedish company is planning to offer 22.2 million shares, including 6.7 million shares from top executives and pre-IPO investors, at a price range of between $21 and $24 a share, according to a regulatory filing. That would raise as much as $533 million in proceeds. One thing King has in its favor over both Zynga and its older rivals, Mr. Baggini said, was that it is already heavily focused on developing games for iPhones and Android devices, for which it has three games among the top five highest-grossing in terms of revenue in the U.S., according to AppAnnie, which tracks app downloads. “That makes it much easier to get global reach and huge size quickly for new games,” Mr. Baggini said.

California has enjoyed FHA loan limits up to $729,750 in high cost Counties as a result of a temporary increase on conforming loan limits instituted in 2008.

Temporary loan limits, known as high balance loan limits, were instituted in high cost areas of the country in an effort to provide financing options for homeowners, or homebuyers needing to borrow above the long standing conforming loan limits of $417,000.

"On January 1st, 2014, FHA high balance loan limits will be reduced to fall in line with the conventional Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac maximum high balance loan limit of $625,500," says Scott Schang, Branch Manager of Broadview Mortgage Long Beach.

FHA claims that this change will affect only about 2% to 3% of mortgages in the U.S., however, California is one state that will feel this reduction on a much larger scale than most other States in the Country.###1294||Gold rises on weak Chinese exports

Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose Monday on weaker than expected Chinese economic data.



The most active gold contract for April delivery rose 3.3 US dollars, or 0.25 percent, to settle at 1,341.5 dollars per ounce.



China's General Administration of Customs said Saturday the country's exports in February unexpectedly fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier, leaving a trade deficit of 22.98 billion dollars for the month.



The downbeat data added to investors' concerns about growth in China, one of the top gold-consuming nations, although the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.



Market analysts attribute the rise in gold so far this year to extreme weather, drought, the crisis in Ukraine and cheap valuation of the safe-haven asset.



Silver for May delivery lost 1.8 cents, or 0.09 percent, to close at 20.91 dollars per ounce, while Platinum for April delivery slipped 6.4 dollars, or 0.43 percent, to close at 1,477.2 dollars per ounce.

###1295||###1296||SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Here is a timeline of events in the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner which vanished from radar screens on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early on Saturday:

SATURDAY, MARCH 8

- Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 Flight departs at 12:41 a.m. (1641 GMT Friday), and is due to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. (2230 GMT) the same day. On board the Boeing 777-200ER are 227 passengers and 12 crew.

- Airline loses contact with plane between 1-2 hours after takeoff. No distress signal and weather is clear at the time.

- Missing plane last has contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu.

- Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam says plane failed to check in as scheduled at 1721 GMT while flying over sea between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City.

- Flight tracking website flightaware.com shows plane flew northeast over Malaysia after takeoff and climbed to altitude of 35,000 feet. The flight vanished from website’s tracking records a minute later while still climbing.

- Malaysia search ships see no sign of wreckage in area where flights last made contact. Vietnam says giant oil slick and column of smoke seen in its waters.

- Two men from Austria and Italy, listed among the passengers on a missing Malaysia Airlines flight, are not in fact on board. They say their passports were stolen.

SUNDAY, MARCH 9

- Malaysia Airlines says fears worst and is working with U.S. company that specialises in disaster recovery.

- Radar indicates flight may have turned back from its scheduled route to Beijing before disappearing.

- Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is “examining additional suspect passports”.

- Investigators narrow focus of inquiries on possibility plane disintegrated in mid-flight, a source who is involved in the investigations in Malaysia tells Reuters.

MONDAY, MARCH 10

- The United States review of American spy satellite imagery shows no signs of mid-air explosion.

- As dozens of ships and aircraft from seven countries scour the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam, questions mounted over whether a bomb or hijacking could have brought down the Boeing airliner.

- Hijacking could not be ruled out, said the head of Malaysia’s Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahmanthe, adding the missing jet was an “unprecedented aviation mystery”.

- The disappearance of the Malaysian airliner could dent the national carrier’s plan to return to profit by end-2014, equity analysts said. Shares in MAS hot a record low on Monday.

- Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble names the two men who boarded jet with stolen passports as Iranians, aged 18 and 29, who had entered Malaysia using their real passports. “The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident,” Noble said.

- Malaysian police chief said the younger man appeared to be an illegal immigrant. His mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt and had been in contact with authorities, he said.

- Malaysian police say they are investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.

- Malaysia’s military believes missing jet turned and flew hundreds of kilometres to the west after it last made contact with civilian air traffic control off the country’s east coast, a senior officer told Reuters. The jet made it into the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping channels, along Malaysia’s west coast, said the officer.

- A Colorado-based company has put “crowdsourcing” to work in search for a missing jet, enlisting Internet users to comb through satellite images of more than 1,200 square miles (3,200 square km) of open seas for any signs of wreckage.

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12

- The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet expands to an area stretching from China to India, as authorities struggle to answer what had happened to the aircraft that vanished almost five days ago with 239 people on board.

In the process, Republicans have been criticized for failing to present an alternative piece of legislation to replace Obamacare. More than a dozen alternative plans have been crafted on the Hill, but Republicans haven't been able to rally around a single plan. Now, that's changing as Republican prepare to present Americans with an official alternative to the Affordable Care Act:

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.



But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,” with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents.



The timing for this legislation is great for Republicans who just came off of a special election win in Florida where Democrat Alex Sink lost by running on a fix, don't repeal platform. Not only can Republicans running for election in the fall run against Obamacare, a law that will only continue to make the lives of Americans worse and more expensive, they can run on a new alternative.###1301||Waco, TX (76701)

New Zealand hikes its rates. The economy has steadied since earthquakes rattled Christchurch, and strong dairy exports have boosted business, so this could be the month that New Zealand’s central bank begins raising interest rates after leaving them untouched previously.



Good news for Australian workers, or at least, no worse. The country expects a bump in new jobs after a fall last month, though not by enough to budge the unemployment rate, which is at a ten-and-a-half-year high. Signs that China may be slowing down again don’t augur well for the recovery.

Lufthansa’s profits soar. Lufthansa expects to post a full-year operating profit of up to €700 million ($973.28 million), compared to €524 million in the previous year. Investors will be looking to see whether the German airline will reinstate the dividend it axed last year (paywall); some analysts expect €0.45 per share.

American spending gets back in the black. Analysts expect retail sales to have grown 0.1% last month, after contracting by 0.1% in December and 0.4% in January. As 70% of GDP is driven by consumer spending, this would be happy news for the US economy.

In the short term, the latest move could take the yuan down a notch.

Speculators have long been enamored with the currency, also known as the renminbi, seeing it as a one-way bet that can only gain in value.

Last month, the People's Bank of China launched a surprise attack on short-term investors, diving into the market and dragging the renminbi down to sting those who had banked on appreciation. Bigger one-day swings only make that sort of bet more risky.

"The currency could overshoot on the weak side for a while," said Liu Li-Gang, an economist at ANZ. "The PBOC's intention was to penalize speculators, and it will work."

Mr. Liu expects the exchange rate to reach 6.20 or 6.25 to the dollar within the next week, compared with 6.14 now, as speculators flee the market. A higher number indicates a weaker yuan because one dollar buys more Chinese currency.

The central bank's official line is that the yuan is fairly valued, with no fundamental pressure in either direction. "There is no basis for big appreciation of the renminbi," the bank said in an announcement as it widened the band, adding that "there is no basis for big depreciation" either.

Many in the market would disagree. "I see plenty of structural drivers pointing to strengthening," said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS, pointing to China's persistent trade surplus and investment inflows.

Last year, China's trade surplus--the difference between exports and imports--came to a whopping $238 billion, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. The country also attracted $171 billion in foreign direct investment, SAFE said, and $72 in financial inflows. All of those things put upward pressure on the currency.

The only thing that could really undermine China's currency in the long term is capital moving out of the country. The government has strict controls on that, with residents limited to taking $50,000 abroad--plenty for shopping trips to London, but peanuts in the world of international financial flows.

There are ways around that, for the enterprising. Bitcoin is an open wound in China's capital controls. So are the junket operations that smuggle money out through Macau casinos.

But law-abiding citizens are still largely limited to the domestic property and stock markets. With China's stock exchange consistently among the world's worst performers, that has meant the nation's savings are largely held in real estate.

If China made it easier for its citizens to invest money abroad, some of those pent-up savings would quickly flow out. With less cash chasing property, the domestic housing market could take a pummeling. So could the yuan.

Mr. Liu at ANZ thinks loosening up China's capital controls is long overdue. "The longer they wait, the harder it will be," he said.

China's government says it wants a flexible currency and a more open capital account. But real flexibility and openness would come at a price.

The government says it is satisfied with REMPEC’s oil spill prevention efforts, but Environment Minister Leo Brincat yesterday refused to go into detail regarding preparations for a possible ecological disaster in the Mediterranean as the Libyan government has stepped up its threats of blowing up an oil tanker loaded with “illicit oil”.

The situation in Libya has turned from bad to worse as rebels in command of a number of ports are trying to export oil illegally from the country from three ports they occupied months ago.

The ship in question – the North Korean flagged ‘Morning Glory’ – is currently moored in Al-Sidra port, near Ras Lanuf, some 300 kilometres from Malta. Libyan officials said on Monday that the ship had finished loading its bunkers with illegal oil, estimated to be worth some $36 million.

The Libyan authorities yesterday turned things up a notch, with the country’s Culture Minister, Al-Habib al-Amin insisting that the ship would be blown out of the water should it attempt to leave port. “It is final and decisive. Any attempt by the tanker to move and it will be turned into scrap.”

The tanker is currently besieged by Libyan Navy ships and loyalist militias, who insisted that if the ship did not surrender it would be “shelled completely.” According to reports the loyalist militias have placed 22 fishing vessels armed with mortar and rocket launchers around the tanker.

But the rebels have insisted that an attack on the vessel would be considered an act of war and they would retaliate. Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said: "harming any tanker or sending navy ships into the waters of Cyrenaica. It the tanker is harmed the response from Cyrenaica's defense forces, oil guards and revolutionaries will be decisive. Such a move would be a declaration of war."

Situation could turn into an ecological disaster

Sources told this paper that any attack on the ship could result in an ecological disaster off the coast of Libya with thousands of tons of oil pouring into the Mediterrenean.

When asked if he was concerned by these developments Environment Minister Leo Brincat said that the government had taken immediate action.

“The moment we were alerted about the problem we took immediate action and asked REMPEC to take all the necessary measures. This was done to our satisfaction throughout Sunday wherein we were kept updated about the situation.”

REMPEC is the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea, which is based in Malta. However, when asked to be more specific on these “necessary measures” Mr Brincat curtly replied that “he has nothing to add.”

A result of the post- Gaddafi Libya

The port of Al-Sidra has been under militia control since the summer, slowing the country's oil output — once estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day — to a trickle. For months the Libyan government has been threatening to use force against the Eastern militias, who are demanding greater self-rule and equal distribution of the oil wealth. Libya has been gripped by unrest since the ousting of dictator Muammar Ghaddafi in 2011 as militias from different tribes have seized power over different areas and refused to give up control, and their weapons.

Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said on Sunday that he had given the order for more troops to move into the al-Sidra area and the Prosecutor General has issued an arrest warrant for the tanker captain and its crew members. He also ordered the tanker to be confiscated.

It seems that the Libyan government has Washington’s backing. The US Department of State said on Sunday that it was deeply concerned by reports that a tanker is loading illicitly obtained oil.

“This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people,” it said, insisting that the oil belongs to the Libyan government and private oil companies, including US firms.

On the other hand experts have noted that the ship is not actually controlled by Pyongyang but is likely to be using the North Korean flag as a flag of convenience.

In January, Libyan forces had fired warning shots and stopped a Maltese registered tanker – the mv Baku – from reaching the port.###1306||Cryptocurrency Gets Real

ASI fellow Preston Byrne explains why bitcoin's recent problems do not mean the cryptocurrency-cum-payments-system is over. In fact, the promise of cryptography in payments and contracts is as exciting as ever.

Last week was a horrible week for Bitcoin: as “transaction malleability” (in effect, a form of distributed denial of service attack) entered the lexicon, $2.7 million of Bitcoins were stolen from Silk Road 2, Russia banned it and the App Store followed suit, the value of a single Bitcoin fell to roughly half – as against USD – as it was 14 days ago.

One could be forgiven for thinking it is “all over” for cryptocurrency; the sector is more than just Bitcoin, however, and as a whole the market tells a very different story. Slowly but surely, the one-trick crypto pony is becoming a multilateral ecosystem and one of the more interesting of these developments was the establishment of Ethereum, a project to build a platform to run smart contract protocols.

“What the hell is a smart contract?” You ask.

If Bitcoin is cryptography’s answer to payment systems, smart contracts are cryptography’s answer to commerce. Traditional contract law – the process of negotiating, creating, and enforcing agreements – is a complex body of rules, with something as straightforward as purchasing a cup of coffee involving a number of legal fictions which a court, on later review, can invoke to determine how an alleged breach of this notional agreement (much of which is implied by law rather than stated expressly, particularly in a consumer context) should be remedied, if at all, to do justice between the parties.

From a libertarian perspective, this system has a number of downsides, chief among them in that it empowers the state to interfere with the content of private contracts on the basis of, e.g., public policy (implied terms of employment, other statutory interference with the freedom to contract), taxation (VAT, stamp duty), or welfare objectives (planning gain) which limit individual liberty and interfere with price rationality.

One of the most popular proposed alternatives to the status quo is David Friedman’s, who proposed abolishing the courts entirely in favour of a system of private enforcement based on private arbitration agencies (in effect, gargantuan legal conglomerates) and a universal reputational rating and disclosure system akin to today’s credit rating agencies. In either Friedman’s case or that of the status quo, however, a “trusted third party” – be it a court or an agency – is required to administer the system, the problem Bitcoin was designed to solve. And just like Bitcoin is designed to remove trusted third parties from payment systems, Nick Szabo, the American legal and economic philosopher, wrote in 1997 that smart contracts would eliminate the trust problem from commercial agreements, too: in a world dominated by “institutions of written literacy,” he said, “we take for granted that contracts and law are written on this static medium, to be interpreted and enforced by human authorities.” But where smart contracts will pose a threat to financial intermediaries such as banks, they will also threaten the reach of those authorities to which those intermediaries customarily submit – regulators and the courts.

Where the programmer would say that the blockchain has removed the need for a trusted third party, the lawyer counters that the blockchain is the trusted third party, quite unlike any that has come before it. It is an automaton, carrying out very sophisticated functions, lacking personhood, located nowhere, owning nothing, making no representations or promises. It is more akin to a force of nature, like the weather, than the human institutions it was built to replace. It thus defies easy classification and raises more difficult questions than the manifestly obvious points about money laundering and terrorist financing which are currently in general circulation.

Say, for example, a miner finds a block but, through no fault of his own, winds up on the wrong fork. He has carried out a series of acts which, under English contract law, might otherwise constitute satisfactory performance of a unilateral contract, entitling him to the reward in full. His coins, however, are rendered worthless when the rest of the network abandons him by consensus; what recourse should he have? Who should he sue – the blockchain? Class-action against the network? What if a court awards specific performance – awarding the claimant coins on the correct fork – only to find that specific performance is mathematically impossible for the state to coerce? Would it find all of the users of the cryptocurrency in question jointly and severally liable to reimburse the claimant for the loss, or would it say that the caveat emptor principle applied – and the unfortunate miner implicitly consented to the possibility that the network might leave him behind?

Examining these transactions at a still more granular level, are units of cryptocurrency even property to begin with? A Bitcoin is not specie (a banknote), nor is it an amount credited to an account (which is not money, but a contractual obligation owed by a financial institution to a depositor pursuant to contract) – the blockchain, we will recall, lacks capacity to contract. A balance associated with a particular address is not a financial instrument or entitlement in itself, such as a cheque or promissory note; it is merely a history, evidencing that the transaction, and the provision of the relevant private key, has validly taken place in respect of it.

For broadly similar reasons, it strikes me that “private keys” which a blockchain generates also defy normal proprietary classification (see Oxford v Moss and the discussion in Palmer & McKendrick (1998)) – if you steal a piece of paper with a private key on it, that is theft, but what happens if you find a piece of paper with a private key, take a photograph of it, and access that wallet on your own?**

This isn’t to say that property – enforceable promises – cannot exist in respect of, or be denominated in Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, or that cryptocurrency isn’t actually property: quite clearly they can and quite clearly it is (even if the law doesn’t yet recognize it as such). What I mean to say is that cryptocurrency, in solving the problem of the trusted third party, presents a more fundamental challenge to the logic of the established order than we once supposed – and this is only Bitcoin we’re talking about, to say nothing of the autonomous distributed corporations which are quickly approaching realisation.

What exactly will happen as the real world and cryptocommerce begin to get acquainted, no one can say. But I am sure of this: it will be a lot of fun to watch.

**N.B. – In the United States, insolvency filings made last week relating to a Bitcoin mining firm illustrate beautifully some of the teething problems to which cryptocurrency litigation will give rise. Read the transcript (Document 113 (pt 2)) here.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

~ Fourth Quarter Net Income of $3.04 Per Diluted Share ~ YORK, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:BONT) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 ended February 1, 2014. Results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 were impacted by the inclusion of an additional week in each period, resulting in a 14-week and 53-week reporting period, respectively, in accordance with the National Retail Federation fiscal reporting calendar. This compares with a reporting period ended February 1, 2014 of 13 weeks and 52 weeks in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013, respectively.Brendan Hoffman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Despite disappointing fourth quarter sales results, we continued to make progress on several strategic initiatives that we believe will drive improved performance. Multiple snowstorms and the polar vortex during the December and January periods resulted in a sharp decline in traffic and, therefore, we were unable to achieve our comparable store sales goals in the fourth quarter. In spite of these top line pressures, we were able to achieve a gross margin rate slightly better than prior year and reduce expenses. In addition, we effectively managed our inventory such that we ended the year with inventory levels approximately 5% below that of the prior year, including a significant reduction in carryover merchandise, leaving us well positioned for the spring season." Mr. Hoffman continued, "We have made great strides in executing our strategic initiatives and will continue to focus on enhancing our merchandise assortments, driving our eCommerce business, refining our marketing strategy and moving forward with our localization initiative, all with an eye on improving our productivity. We are excited about our new eCommerce fulfillment center, which will permit significant expansion of our shipping capacity with improved operational efficiency. We will continue strengthening our foundation to deliver profitable sales growth in the coming years."For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, total sales in the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2014 decreased 9.9% to $914.9 million, compared with $1,015.1 million in the 14-week period ended February 2, 2013.

[ + - ]

(NBC News) Newly released numbers show Colorado brought in a total of $3.5 million in marijuana taxes and fees in January, the state's first month of legal recreational sales.





During the January launch the state says customers bought just over $14 million worth of recreational pot.





Taxes from those sales totaled roughly $2-million.





The state also collected around $1.5 million in tax revenue from medical marijuana.





Still, Governor John Hickenlooper calls for caution when considering future spending.





"I don't think we should become dependent on revenues or start thinking wow look at those revenues," he says.

The governor's spending priorities for the tax money includes youth prevention, substance abuse treatment and public health.

###1312||Sometimes, what seems obvious on the surface isn’t necessarily the best way of looking at a situation. The recent crisis between Ukraine and Russia is a perfect example.

A very basic fundamental analysis of the situation would lead one to conclude that if hostilities were to break out, one of the results would be a disruption to the oil and natural gas supplied to Europe. This makes sense, since many pipelines and oil/gas fields are located in Ukraine and Russia.

What most people don’t realize is that stocks traded here in America could be negatively impacted and could perhaps have their earnings outlook downgraded due to such an event, even though the price of oil and gas might rise.

One point to make is that natural gas is more of a local commodity, so fundamental analysis cannot be extrapolated on a global basis, since transportation is far more difficult than oil.

The earnings outlook for some non-Russian companies could have issues, since many firms have agreements or outright equity stakes in Russian companies.

A perfect example is BP p.l.c. (NYSE/BP), which has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, a giant Russian energy company. Approximately one-third of BP’s production comes from this stake in Rosneft, which could impact the earnings outlook for the company if tensions rise. Of course, BP does have other assets, including a pipeline that does not go through Ukraine, which could see an increase in demand partially offsetting any decrease in the earnings outlook from their stake in Rosneft.

This is a situation where the fundamental analysis might seem simple, but the reality is that understanding the interlinked nature of global business these days makes the calculation far more difficult.

While many people might look to an increase in the earnings outlook for oil companies based on a spike in the price of commodities, one does need to be careful in determining which firms offer upside potential without downside risks from ties to that region.

Clearly, the recent events have added a boost to the price of oil; it doesn’t take much fundamental analysis to realize that’s the case. I think a geopolitical situation such as this won’t end quickly, and even if it does, the easy monetary policies globally will continue to provide a bid for the price of oil going forward, improving the earnings outlooks for companies in this sector.

One stock that I have liked for a long time is Buckeye Partners, L.P. (NYSE/BPL). Buckeye owns more than 6,000 miles of oil pipeline systems in America with 55 million barrels of liquid petroleum storage capacity. Internationally, the company also has six liquid petroleum terminals in various ports, such as St. Lucia, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas. (Source: Buckeye Partners, L.P. web site, last accessed March 5, 2014.)

The earnings outlook still remains very strong for this company. A quick fundamental analysis of the fourth-quarter 2013 financial results shows that the firm reported $87.5 million in net income from continuing operations, up significantly from the $32.5 million during the same quarter in 2012.

There clearly isn’t enough room in this article to go into an in-depth fundamental analysis report on Buckeye, but my point is that an investor needs to take into account many factors before determining the earnings outlook of the company.

Don’t make the mistake of rushing into a position due to a recent geopolitical event. As an investor, your goal is to own a solid business for the long term. Focus on the fundamental analysis of the business, and the market will reward you over time.

“Digital currencies right now are very, very trendy,” said Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board. “There’s a lot of buzz about them. It’s really easy to look at the benefits, the positives of digital currencies, without really appreciating these risks.

“Those risks can wipe out the entirety of their investment in not months, not weeks, but in a matter of moments.”

Digital currencies like bitcoin are essentially long lines of computer code that may be encrypted and sent or received without involving a financial institution or government agency.

“In many ways, digital currencies operate as ‘online cash,’ only this type of currency is extremely volatile and can disappear the same way your money disappears when you lose your wallet,” said John Morgan, Texas securities commissioner.

Bitcoin has become increasingly popular among tech enthusiasts, libertarians and risk-seeking investors because it allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money across borders without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. Criminals like bitcoin for the same reasons.

The currency attracted media attention and the fascination of millions as an increasing number of large retailers such as Overstock.com began to accept it.

Bitcoin isn’t the only digital currency that’s sprung up.

“The last I checked, which was right at the beginning of this year, there were about 14 digital currencies,” Rotunda said. “There’s more of them in production right now, in development. It’s a real fertile ground.”

Investors must use caution when dealing with digital currencies, securities regulators said.

“Anybody who’s investing in digital currencies is going to be highly dependent upon the securities systems, the infrastructure, the accounting practices, overall business model of whomever they’re entrusting the custody of their investment to,” Rotunda said.

What’s more, a lack of regulation of digital currencies leaves investors exposed, he said.

“Digital currencies in large part allow users to be anonymous,” Rotunda said. “That makes it hard from a regulatory standpoint to regulate those transactions, but it also fosters an environment that caters to money laundering to conceal transactions to all sorts of situations where a promoter could be playing with investors’ money without their own knowledge.”

That includes Ponzi schemes. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.

Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in investments that promoters claim generate high returns with little or no risk.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint last year that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin-denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.

The SEC alleged that from September 2011 to September 2012 Shavers raised more than 700,000 bitcoins worth about $4.5 million based on bitcoin prices then.

“We are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes in which these currencies are used to facilitate fraudulent, or simply fabricated, investments or transactions,” the SEC said in an Investor Alert in July. “These schemes often promise high returns for getting in on the ground floor of a growing Internet phenomenon.”

Rotunda had advice for investors.

“If you’re investing in bitcoins or something tied to bitcoins or other digital currencies, do due diligence on the person promoting the investment,” he said. “Try to look at these things objectively, evaluate their own personal situation. An investment tied to digital currencies may be suitable for someone in their 20s, in their 30s. When you’re talking about a retiree’s nest egg, that may not be something they’d want to subject to this type of a risk.”

Over the weekend, the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 became a criminal investigation as Malaysian officials said they had "conclusive" evidence that the flight had been hijacked. They also said that a final message had been received from the pilot after the plane's signaling apparatus had been disabled, raising suspicion that the flight was intentionally diverted by crew. There have also been numerous reports this morning that plane may have flown as low as 5,000 feet, in order to avoid all radar detection, a maneuver that would require considerable skill from the pilots, while also putting the plane itself in considerable danger, as it is not designed for long travel at that altitude.

In a press conference today, Malaysia Airlines officials say they now believe it was the co-pilot who spoke those final words. The Acting Transport Minister Hussein Hishammuddin added during the conference that Malaysia is requesting renewed assistance from the countries involved in the search, saying:

Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search and rescue operation. This includes two groups: first, countries in the search corridors; and second, countries from which we are seeking assistance and expertise. For countries in the search corridors, we are requesting radar and satellite information, as well as specific assets for the search and rescue operation. We are asking them to share their land, sea and aerial search and rescue action plans with the Rescue Co-ordination Centre here in Malaysia, so that we can co-ordinate the search effort. We have asked for regular updates, including daily reports on both search activities, and details of any information required from Malaysia.

Twenty-six countries are now involved in the search, and Australia has taken the lead in searching the Indian Ocean.

King Digital Entertainment, the Dublin-based maker of “Candy Crush,” said it plans to sell 22.2 million shares priced at between $21 and $24 a share in its initial public offering.

That range values King Digital at up to $7.6 billion — slightly below the $9 billion valuation mobile gaming company Zynga sought when it went public in 2011.

Since announcing its IPO plans last month, King has been unable to shake comparisons to Zynga, which has watched its shares tumble close to 50 percent since going public — leaving its valuation at $4.7 billion.

King’s conservative valuation suggests the company and its bankers are worried about turning the stomachs of already wary investors.

“Candy Crush” was the most downloaded free app on Apple’s iTunes store last year. But Zynga’s “FarmVille” was all the rage at the time of its IPO.

Meanwhile, King said revenues in the fourth quarter dropped to $601.7 million from $621.1 million the previous quarter, which has some watchers worried that the “Candy Crush” fad is already fading.

“Candy Crush” accounted for 78 percent of King’s fourth-quarter revenue.

In Illinois, enrollment in the state’s health insurance exchange has begun to pick up momentum. Nearly 900 people are enrolling for coverage through the exchange on a daily basis, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some 113,733 people throughout the state have enrolled for coverage through the exchange in the first five months of its existence. Similar results are being seen in other states when it comes to enrollment rates in insurance exchanges.

HHS shows that 4.2 million people have enrolled in exchanges throughout the country

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 4.2 million people have enrolled into exchanges nationwide. Currently, the country is on track toward meeting its enrollment goals by the time the open enrollment period for exchanges comes to a close. Illinois officials note that the state is expected to reach its goals before the March 31 deadline, when the state’s exchange is no longer able to accept new enrollees.

March 31 deadline may be the most effective marketing tool for insurance exchanges

Illinois has been making attempts to market the exchange and its services to consumers throughout the state for months now. The best form of marketing for the exchange may actually be coming from the looming March 31 deadline. After the open enrollment period for exchanges ends, consumers will only be able to find coverage through the private market. This also means that they will not be able to take advantage of the services offered by the state’s exchange, including access to federal subsidies that could reduce the cost of health insurance coverage significantly.

The uninsured could face federal penalties if they continue to live without insurance coverage

When the open enrollment period comes to an end, the uninsured are likely to face penalties from the federal government. These penalties are meant to incentivize the acquisition of insurance coverage. The penalties are, however, quite modest and may do little to encourage people to purchase insurance policies from the private market.###1322||A Malaysian police official displays photographs of the two men who boarded the Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight

KUALA LUMPUR: The last words spoken from the cockpit of the Malaysian passenger jet that went missing 10 days ago were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot, the airline's top executive said Monday.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a news briefing.

The last message from the cockpit - "All right, good night" - came around the time that two of the missing plane's crucial signalling systems were switched off.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid have become a primary focus of the investigation into the fate of Flight 370, with one of the key questions being who was controlling the aircraft when the communications systems were disabled.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's seemingly nonchalant final words.

ACARS transmits key information on a plane's condition to the ground.

The plane's transponder - which relays radar information on the plane's location - was switched off just two minutes after the voice message.

Missing plane probe: focus on cockpit crew



KUALA LUMPUR: An investigation into the pilots of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 intensified Monday after officials confirmed that the last words spoken from the cockpit came after a key signalling system was manually disabled.

US intelligence efforts were also focusing on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, according to a senior US lawmaker.

"I think from all the information I've been briefed on from, you know, high levels within homeland security, national counterterrorism centre, intelligence community, that something was going on with the pilot," said Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.

"I think this all leads towards the cockpit, with the pilot himself, and co-pilot," McCaul said on Fox News Sunday.

Malaysia's transport minister confirmed Sunday that an apparently relaxed final voice communication from the cockpit - "All right, good night" - came after the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) had been deliberately shut down.

ACARS transmits to the ground key information on a plane's condition.

It has not been confirmed who gave that final voice message. But the assumption is the person would have known the ACARS system had been disabled.

The plane's transponder - which relays radar information on the plane's location - was switched off 14 minutes after ACARS went down.

Shortly afterwards the plane disappeared from civilian radar, but Malaysia has since confirmed that the air force tracked it for hours on military radar - without taking action.

The plane went missing early in the morning of March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard, spawning a massive international search across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean that has turned up no trace of wreckage.

' Contradictory information'



Two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese, and state media in China attacked Malaysia anew on Monday for its handling of the crisis.

"The contradictory and piecemeal information Malaysia Airlines and its government have provided has made search efforts difficult and the entire incident even more mysterious," the China Daily newspaper wrote in an editorial.

"What else is known that has not been shared with the world?" it asked.



Last contact came after shutdown began

Kuala Lumpur: The person in control of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 issued their last communication to air traffic control after the first set of aircraft communications was disabled, Malaysian authorities have confirmed, adding further weight to suspicion that the plane was hijacked.

The latest revelation suggests that the person who delivered the "All right, good night" message to Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers just before the Boeing-777 disappeared from their radar at 1.22am and diverted from its scheduled flightpath to Beijing was also aware that the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars) had been manually shut down.

Investigations still do not appear to know who was at the helm and what their intentions were when the aircraft disappeared from civilian radar more than a week ago.

Waiting for information

Malaysian investigators are still waiting for some countries to send background checks on passengers who were on a missing Malaysia Airlines’ jetliner as they intensify inquiries into a suspected deliberate diversion of the plane, the country's police chief said on Sunday.

"There are still a few countries yet to respond to our requests," Khalid Abu Bakar told a news conference.

Police are also investigating airport ground staff and have intensified their checks on the two pilots, including examining a flight simulator seized from the captain's home, he said.

Investigators have stepped up their scrutiny of the 239 crew members and passengers of lost Malaysia Airlines’ Flight MH370.



Pakistan is not hiding Missing Malaysian Airlines jet: Official

Islamabad : The Pakistan government has denied media reports that said the missing Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines jetliner, with 239 passengers and crew on board, might be hidden somewhere in Pakistan.

Shujaat Azeem, Special Aviation Assistant to the Pakistan Prime Minister, said the flight disappeared very far off from Pakistan, was never visible on the country’s radars, and hence there was no chance Pakistan was hiding it, The Nation reported.



Pilots' homes searched, flight simulator examined: authorities

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia said Sunday that police had searched the homes of a missing airliner's two pilots and were examining the captain's home flight simulator, but warned against "jumping to conclusions".

"Police searched the home of the pilot on Saturday, 15 March," a statement by the transport ministry said, referring to Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53.

"Officers spoke to family members of the pilot and experts are examining the pilot's flight simulator."

The statement added: "On 15 March, the police also searched the home of the co-pilot."

Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was co-pilot of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, which vanished eight days ago, sparking a massive international search across a huge swathe of Asia.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday the plane appeared to have been deliberately diverted from its flight path after it dropped off radar. He said satellites continued to detect it for hours afterwards, an announcement which raised fears of a hijack or rogue action by pilots or crew.

The revelation has prompted fresh scrutiny of the two pilots.

Zaharie is said to have assembled his own complex flight simulator at home but nothing has emerged to cast suspicion on him.

The government statement said engineers who may have had contact with Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before it took off on March 8 were also part of the probe into the missing jet, but called this "normal procedure" for such an event.

"We appeal to the public not to jump to conclusions regarding the police investigation," it said.

It reiterated that all crew and passengers on board the flight were being investigated for possible leads. Nothing that suggests a motive had yet surfaced, it said.

The plane disappeared from civilian radar less than an hour into its journey from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Najib also said investigators believe that systems relaying MH370's location to air traffic control were manually switched off before the jet veered westward.

An Australian television programme earlier broadcast an interview by a South African woman who alleged that she and a friend were invited into the cockpit of a 2011 flight co-piloted by Fariq, in breach of post-9/11 security rules.

India suspends search for plane, awaits new instructions

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday suspended its search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370 around the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands and in the Bay of Bengal and are awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysia, a defence official said.

"The entire operation is on hold for now. We are awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysia. Nothing came out of the search in designated areas on Saturday," said Colonel Harmit Singh, spokesman for India's army, navy and airforce command in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.



Hunt for MH370 now criminal probe

Sepang, Malaysia: The hunt for flight MH370 took a dramatic new turn on Saturday after the Malaysian Prime Minister said the missing jetliner’s air communications system and transponder had been deliberately switched off by someone on board before the Boeing 777 turned back and flew northwest.

Najib Razak also said that search efforts in the South China Sea had been ended, and that technical experts now believed that the aircraft could have ended up anywhere in one of two zones — one as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and the other crossing the southern Indian Ocean.

That conclusion was based on a final signal from the plane picked up on satellite at 8.11 am on March 8, nearly seven hours after ground control lost contact with the jet, he said.

While Najib said that investigators had not ruled out alternatives to hijacking, his remarks represented official confirmation that the disappearance of the Boeing 777-200 a week earlier had not been an accident.

He noted that one communications system had been disabled as the plane flew over the northeast coast of Malaysia and that a second system, a transponder aboard the aircraft, had stopped broadcasting its location, altitude, speed and other information at 1.21 am while the plane was one-third of the way across the Gulf of Thailand from Malaysia to Vietnam.

Najib’s news conference came a day after American officials told The New York Times that Flight 370 had experienced significant changes in altitude after it lost contact with ground control, and altered its course more than once as if still under the command of a pilot.

Military radar data subsequently showed that the aircraft turned and flew west across northern Malaysia before arcing out over the wide northern end of the Strait of Malacca, headed at cruising altitude for the Indian Ocean.

The Seventh Fleet of the United States Navy said in a statement yesterday that its search for the plane now encompassed the Strait of Malacca and beyond to the Bay of Bengal — an enormous area.

But Najib said that representatives of many more governments across the region had been contacted, since the plane might have been flying for many hours after it left Malaysian airspace. By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.

Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.

Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.

As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.

According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.

Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.

Crew, passengers under scrutiny

Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.

Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.

"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."

Pilot's home searched

Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.

Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.

Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.

Plane 'deliberately' diverted

Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.

As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.

"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.

The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.

Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.

That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off. It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.

Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.

"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.

He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

Two routes

Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.

The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.

The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.

Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.

That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.

The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.

It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.

When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.

In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.

The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.



South China Sea search for jet called off



Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.

"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.

Plane hijacked, official says

A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.

The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.

The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.

He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.

The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.

The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.

The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.

In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."

The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.

"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.

The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.

Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.

The New York Times, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.

The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the Times reported.###1323||Getty

The estimated value of the new Chiquita-Fyffes is some 1.0 billion US dollars.

Shareholders are to get shares in both firms with Fyffes’ holding some 49.3 percent.

Reuters Breakingviews columnist Robert Cole said bananas are a serious subject: “Yes I mean we smile about it, but it’s been a really hot business/political topic for years and years and years. There are small countries in the West Indies and other places, which depend on bananas. So having a global, very powerful company really might not suit some of the competition authorities.”

The new company is expected to process some 180 million boxes of bananas, outstripping all other competitors.

The merger will be subject to review by competition regulators. However, as the fruit firms operate in separate European and North American markets the deal is expected to go through.###1326||Second track worker killed in 12 months

According to the Pentagon, the move was made at "request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments."

No one was hurt "when U.S. forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement, reported by Agence France-Presse.

The ship was boarded by the SEALs just after 0200 GMT Monday "in international waters southeast of Cyprus" following President Barack Obama approval of the operation.

The statement said the ship "is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra."

The Morning Glory, which departed from the eastern Libyan port of Al-Sidra -- controlled by rebels seeking autonomy from the authorities in Tripoli -- is reported to have loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude, according to Agence France-Presse.

The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.

Pyongyang had "cancelled and deleted" the ship's North Korean registry, as it violated its law "on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo."

"Therefore, the ship has nothing to do" with North Korea, which "has no responsibility whatsoever as regards the ship," KCNA said.

UPI/Eric A. Pastor/US Navy | License Photo

With 25 countries now on the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, combing land and sea for any sign of the missing plane, Malaysian officials have started to turn their attention to MH 370's pilots.

A senior Malaysian official said Sunday that one of the plane's pilots -- either Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, or an unknown person -- spoke to traffic control after the plane diverted from its flight path and after its signaling system had been disabled.

"All right, good night," someone reportedly told air traffic control.

“This will tell you something…because this is something not normal that the pilot would do,” Malaysian Air Force Maj. General Affendi Buang said of the mysteriously calm last words.

U.S. intelligence officials have already been looking into the possibility that one or both of the plane's pilots are responsible for its disappearance. Authorities began searching Shah's home on Saturday.

[NY Times, NY Post, CNN]###1346||There's a good chance that Virtu CEO Vincent Viola will be the latest Wall Street CEO to hit billionaire status.

Viola, the founder--and majority shareholder--of New York high-frequency market maker, Virtu, stands to make a fortune as his firm readies to go public on NASDAQ. The Financial Times reported today that the IPO could fetch a valuation of $3 billion and that Viola (who owns more than 65% of the shares) could net a paper fortune worth more than $2 billion. Also cashing in--Silver Lake Partners who put $250 million in the company back in 2011 when Virtu merged with Madison Tyler--a market maker also founded by Viola.

Last September Viola bought the NHL's Florida Panthers in a $240 million deal that according to Forbes "includes the Florida Panthers, the operating agreement with the Broward County-owned BB&T Center, the three-sheet IcePlex in Coral Springs and the rights to develop nine acres surrounding BB&T Center."

Virtu, a high tech, high frequency trader, makes markets in more than 10,000 securities across 210 exchanges. According to the Virtu S1, in 2013 it had revenues of $664.5 million and net income of $182 million. Virtu said it "had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days."

Viola graduated from West Point and served in the Army's 101 Airborne Division before going on to trade at the NYMEX in 1982. He would later become chairman. Viola started market maker Madison Tyler in 2002. He cofounded Virtu in 2008--and merged the firms together in 2011.

We'll be watching Virtu closely as the IPO approaches. It is possible that Viola could net a fortune worth more than $2.25 billion (Virtu and the Panthers)--and given the frothy equity markets, it's a number that could climb much higher once the stock starts trading.

An "import alert" results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices, according to the FDA website.

A spokesman for Sun, India's biggest drugmaker by market value, was not available for comment.

The plant in Karkhadi in Gujarat makes both drug ingredients and formulations, according to Sun's 2013 annual report.###1348||Empty###1349||Deep-sea exploration is dangerous business. Immense pressures of up to 16,000 pounds per square inch can crush even the hardiest subs. The un-manned sub, Nereus, found this out on Saturday as it explored depths as deep as 6 miles.

Seven hours into a nine-hour dive researches lost contact with Nereus. The sub is designed to automatically surface upon losing contact. Crew members aboard the research ship Thomson were unable to retrieve the sub and soon noticed debris from Nereus on the surface.

Researchers now believe the un-manned sub was destroyed during an implosion under massive pressures.

“Extreme exploration of this kind is never without risk, and the unfortunate loss of Nereus only underscores the difficulty of working at such immense depths and pressures,” WHOI Director of Research Larry Madin said in a statement.

The Nereus has been in service since 2008 when it was built by the Deep Submergence Lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The vehicle, valued at $8 million, was designed to dive the deepest parts of the ocean.

It looks like it met its match in the Kermadec Trench northeast of New Zealand.

Despite Nereus’ demise, exploration of the ocean floor will continue. Other un-manned subs have plenty to look through. Space is often called the final frontier, but we have only scratched the surface of the ocean sea floor. Estimates put 90% of the sea floor uncharted.###1350||Developers will now be able to automate workflow processes by running actions directly on the site — as well as sharing actions with more than 31 million other users###1351||The public relations disaster for General Motors seems to be getting worse by the day.

The Times reports:###1352||Social Security is one of the most popular programs the federal government has ever put into place.

In total, about 57 million Americans received retirement, disability, or survivors’ benefits during 2012 at a cost of about $786 billion. Social Security retirement benefits were received by nine of 10 people age 65 or older during 2012 and were a major source of income for more than two-thirds of retirees.

It might not be surprising in light of the financial challenges Americans have faced during the past few years, but the percentage of people claiming Social Security retirement benefits at the earliest possible age increased by more than 2 percentage points between 2007 and 2009. According to one expert, 41 percent of men and 46 percent of women receive the smallest possible retirement benefit available to them because they claimed early at age 62.

While some Americans might have had little choice about when to claim benefits, it’s important for those who do claim these benefits to plan and make informed decisions because Social Security retirement benefits are more complex than many understand.

Is it worth the effort?

Some Americans are skeptical about whether Social Security benefits will be available when they reach retirement age. Social Security’s reserves, which were built up over three decades when the system took in more revenue than it paid out, are expected to be depleted sometime in the early 2030s. Once reserves run out, the tax revenue that funds Social Security will cover only three-fourths of scheduled benefits.

There are a variety of options that might help keep Social Security viable, including revising benefit formulas, raising taxes, raising the cap on taxable income, increasing retirement age, or some combination of all of these. Regardless of the challenge and the expense, the vast majority of Americans want to see the program continue, according to a 2013 study by the Pew Research Center. In fact, 90 percent of Americans want spending on Social Security to remain as it is or increase.\

Americans’ reasons for wanting to preserve Social Security often are personal. However, AARP recently argued there are economic reasons for keeping the program in place, as well. A study released by the AARP Public Policy Institute suggested Social Security payments during 2012 supported about 9.2 million jobs; $1.4 trillion in economic output (goods and services); $774 billion in value added (gross domestic product); $370 billion in salaries, wages and other compensation; and $222 billion in tax revenues for local, state, and federal governments.

The study also pointed out a significant portion of these benefits might be offset if the Social Security program was modified. In that circumstance, payroll taxes that are currently withheld from workers’ paychecks would drop and the take-home pay of many Americans would increase. It is uncertain whether the money would be spent or saved.

Social Security planning

Whether you believe Social Security retirement benefits could or should be modified, it’s important to understand the options available to you, as well as the role benefits may play in your overall retirement plan. In some cases, particularly when it comes to spousal benefits, maximizing social security income can be quite complex. Here are some basic questions you might need to answer before you make any decisions:

• At what age can you receive full Social Security retirement benefits? (Hint: If you were born after 1943, it’s not age 65.)

• How much will your potential retirement income change if you choose to receive benefits early or late? (If you had maximum taxable earnings and live to age 85, the difference between early and full benefits received over a lifetime is tens of thousands of dollars. The difference between early and late benefits is more than $150,000.)

• Can your spouse, who doesn’t work outside the home, receive Social Security benefits while you’re alive?

• If you and your spouse both work, when should you apply to receive the highest benefits possible?

• How will earnings from work during retirement affect my benefits? (Hint: It depends on the age at which you take benefits.)

Recent studies have found few people understand the dollar value of the decisions they make about Social Security benefits. Social Security planning ensures you understand the amount of income Social Security may provide in various circumstances and develop strategies that can help maximize the benefits you receive.

For couples, making the most of spousal retirement benefits generally requires decisions about when to collect Social Security benefits be coordinated and considered within the context of other retirement income sources.

Financial planning a process

The pursuit of financial security is an ongoing activity. If your goal is to maximize retirement income, then Social Security planning should be a component of your retirement strategy and overall financial plan. Of course, like any other plan, it may need to be modified as your personal circumstances change or as government regulations are altered.

STV

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned there is a "distinct possibility" the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move outside of Scotland if voters back independence.

MPs were also told the rest of the UK was likely to end up bailing out Scotland in the event of a crisis if there was a currency union even if there were explicit guarantees written into an agreement ruling out such an event.

European laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit Scotland, the Treasury select committee heard.

Asked if RBS would have to move to the remaining UK if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: "It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it.

"It depends on their arrangements as well, if they were to adjust more into Scotland the minor management of the institution."

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: "Distinct possibility is a central bank phrase with a sort of layer of lawyer on top."

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls and the Liberal Democrats' Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander have also rejected a monetary alliance.

First Minister Alex Salmond's Scottish Government wants to create a "sterlingzone" with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Mr Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to the eurozone.

He told MPs on Tuesday that the Bank of England did not have to be the lender of last resort to Scottish banks if there was no formal currency union and would be "very conscious of the exposure to the public balance sheet".

Mark Carney: Said in January currency union would mean less sovereignty

Mr Carney said there would be "advantages" to an independent Scotland if it became part of a EU banking union but it would not have a common deposit guarantee scheme and lender of last resort negotiations would have to be made.

"Does it make it more viable?" he added. "It's a mechanism, there's a wide range of factors which would determine viability and viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant. You can't be half viable in a currency union.

"You need all the components. It would advance it but the other components would need to be put in place so you have to look at the package."

Mr Carney suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis.

He told MPs: "There's famously a no-bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but when push came to shove with risks in the periphery that was not fully credible because the spillover effects of not bailing out, or not assisting in some sort of arrangement, were judged, in the teeth of a global crisis, to be too great to risk and so there were extraordinary efforts made, and appropriate efforts, made by European officials to avoid that.

"The issue for the rest of the UK would be would it be credible, I'm not predicting this but one has to plan for contingencies, would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?

"If it is not credible then the structure of the currency union obviously is less than perfect but it is also taking on a contingent liability or responsibility to the rest of the UK balance sheet.

"So, these are all issues that have to be thought through in advance."

RBS: Claim it could have to leave independent Scotland.

Pressed on whether he was going "a long way down the road of saying" that experience showed any system of rules would be vulnerable to the risk of bailouts, he replied: "My view is that the eurozone needs to build that form of fiscal federalism to be viable."

Mr Carney dismissed claims that he thought a currency union was a bad idea for the UK and something he did not support.

He said: "I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments.

"At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate."

When it was suggested that he had created a "less than optimistic picture", he told MPs his intention was to draw attention to the underlying economic issues.

A Better Together spokesman said: "This is an important contribution from the Bank of England governor. What people in Scotland need is clarity from Alex Salmond about his Plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we have to sign up to the euro, as Mark Carney said, or would we set up an unproven separate currency?

"No doubt Alex Salmond's response will the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - Mark Carney is wrong and only the First Minister is right. It simply isn't credible."

Stewart Hosie, SNP Treasury spokesman and a Treasury committee member, said: "I am pleased that the governor took this opportunity to confirm the Bank of England's neutrality on the issue of Scottish independence, and that his Edinburgh speech was a technical assessment of currency unions, not a judgment on independence.

Stewart Hosie: Says statement contradicts No campaign assertion

"Mark Carney was clear that the issue he wanted to get across was the nature of the stability arrangements which are required for the formation of a successful currency union. I am pleased that the Scottish Government's Fiscal Commission Working Group have described in detail a blueprint for such a successful currency union.

"He made the point - in terms of stability arrangements - that what would matter is the aggregate position of the economy and of public spending. That is extremely helpful given Scotland's fiscal position has been stronger on average than the UK's for over three decades.

"I was also pleased that Dr Carney confirmed that judgments on stability arrangements would be based on aggregate numbers such as debt and deficit. This completely contradicts the No campaign assertion that a 'foreign country would be running Scotland's economy'."

Liberal Democrat treasury select committee member John Thurso said: "When a sensible person says sensible things, SNP ministers would be wise to listen. What we heard today was a reasoned, technical and sobering analysis from Mark Carney on the many questions around the SNP's plans for currency, EU entry and our financial services.

"Being in Europe and in Britain is good for Scotland's jobs and growth. We benefit from a single UK-wide market and a single currency which is backed up by a lender of last resort in the Bank of England. Our membership of the EU gives us access to billions of pounds worth of trade. What the SNP are proposing is to leave these key economic and currency unions and seek to renegotiate their way back in, on inevitably poorer terms to Scotland.

"The only way to guarantee these positive unions is to vote to stay in the UK family of nations. But I doubt the SNP's devil may care attitude towards these sensible questions, from people such as Mark Carney, will please even the most ardent of independence supporters."###1364||Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England since July 2013, is seeking to defend the integrity of an institution that, according to Bloomberg News, has become embroiled in a currency-manipulation scandal.

Mark Carney will reportedly face tough testimony, along with Markets Director Paul Fisher, who will appear before Parliament’s cross-party Treasury Committee in London to answer questions on the foreign-exchange inquiry and the central bank’s governance.

A Labour Party member of the Treasury Committee, Pat McFadden, reported that according to Bloomberg News, the Bank of England can’t be its own “judge and jury” and Carney must bring in “someone truly independent to oversee this process.”

He also stated that “The committee is very concerned,” and that “We hope he understands what’s at stake in terms of reputation.” CBC News reported that last week the Bank of England announced the suspension of an unnamed official.

MOST POPULAR ARTICLES sponsored by BCG ATTORNEY SEARCH Read More###1365||Wall Street’s natural mode of dialogue is the relentless, swaggering attack. But even by these standards, the 15-month campaign by the private equity legend Bill Ackman to prove to the markets that Herbalife (the maker of diet shakes and nutritional supplements) is operating a massive pyramid scheme has had the beguiling, manic quality of personal obsession. On Monday, the New York Times published a front-page story accusing Ackman of using his political connections among Democrats and civil rights groups to goad the anti-Herbalife cause onto the political agenda; most seriously, the Times suggested that Ackman knew beforehand when legislators would release market-moving public letters urging regulators to scrutinize the nutrition company. It was the kind of exposé that can destroy even famous men.

As a public-relations counteroffensive, Ackman held a conference call yesterday — not exactly to defend himself (not his style), but to press his case against Herbalife. Ackman is one of the great Wall Street talkers: colloquial and lucid where the norm is sclerotic with jargon; delighted by the details; just supercilious enough. His topic yesterday was Herbalife’s marketing practices in China, and Ackman explained how the company’s sales representatives made nearly all their money not from selling product but from recruiting lower-level sellers. The presentation featured screen-grabs of internal Herbalife financial spreadsheets and many sketches of Herbalife’s marketing structure — each a pyramid — given out by the company’s own Chinese representatives at recruiting seminars. There was a joy to Ackman’s presentation. You could be forgiven for forgetting that this man’s reputation was in rapid and very public collapse, and that his campaign of more than a year to bring down Herbalife had barely budged the company’s stock at all. (One writer called Ackman’s attack on the company “hilariously inept.”) And yet Ackman’s zeal has not been diminished. To bring down Herbalife — a company whose profile was probably smaller than his own — would be, Ackman told a reporter this summer, “the greatest accomplishment of my life.” This afternoon, Herbalife officials confirmed that the FTC had opened a formal investigation into its trading practices, and trading on the stock was halted. This made Ackman’s campaign look, perhaps, a little less futile. But it also elevated the question of what, exactly, is at stake for Ackman in the crusade — of why he went to such extremes to bring down Herbalife at all.

The Times investigation suggested a familiar kind of scandal, in service of this zeal, in which a connected businessman uses his relationship to politics to try to make himself an enormous amount of money. The twist here is — because Ackman believed Herbalife had targeted poor and minority communities in its membership schemes, and because his ties are to Democrats — it was civil rights groups and progressive pols and operatives who did the alleged dirty work. The Times describes a strange political diorama: Ackman prodded Minyon Moore, a Hillary Clinton confidante, who explained the perfidies of Herbalife to a black church group in Los Angeles; Latino community groups with little previous interest in corporate governance flew to Washington, D.C. to stage anti-Herbalife demonstrations to persuade lawmakers to act against the company; letters of complaint were sent to attorneys general under the name of individuals who seemed to know nothing about them; Congresswoman Linda Sanchez and Senator Edward Markey, both staunch progressives, sent letters to regulatory agencies calling for investigations of the company — and, the Times implied, Ackman knew these letters were coming beforehand, which gave him the chance to game the market. (On his conference call, Ackman denied that he had any foreknowledge of the Markey letter and suggested the rest of his lobbying activities were legal and normal.) Ackman’s campaign, the former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt told the Times, looks like “an effort to move the price rather than spread the truth.”

Ackman is the kind of Establishment figure who, when he appears on Charlie Rose, Charlie introduces him by saying, “glad to have you back at this table,” and who, when he is profiled by Vanity Fair, has his eyes described as “cerulean” (which I think means “blue”). Ackman has sat on the board of dean’s advisors at the Harvard Business School. His wife is on the board of Human Rights Watch. He is a major Democratic party contributor. Bloomberg News, in 2010, credited him with steering more than $200 million in Wall Street philanthropy to support Cory Booker’s redevelopment of Newark. We’ve come to expect Wall Street provocateurs to speak in rough outer-borough dialect (think of the brutality done to vowels in Carl Icahn’s Far Rockaway mouth), but Ackman is pure elite: son of a New York real estate tycoon, Chappaqua, prep school, Harvard, Jack Donaghy-level swept gray hair. And yet he has built his career on especially blunt and adversarial charges that American executives and boards were operating businesses in ways that ranged from incompetence to fraud: That JC Penney had been “chronically mismanaged,” that Burger King had been “mismanaged for a long time,” that Herbalife was engaged in illegal and systemic fraud. He is the point, in other words, where the Wall Street Establishment and its pirates become one and the same.

You can sense, here and there, a kind of status anxiety in Ackman — a fear that the piracy will continue to taint him. Short-selling is “still not particularly well accepted as an American way of investing,” Ackman lamented to Reuters TV a year ago. And yet this seems to misunderstand what the Establishment now is, and how it works. The stories we tell about finance are still stories of insiders and outsiders, Davids and Goliaths, in which shrewd hedge funds and private equity mavens and short-selling quants are pitched against the back-slapping fogeys of mainstream corporations and (in some cases) the banks. Our sympathies are intuitively with the contrarians against the conventional wisdom, with the provincial kids against the Ivy Leaguers and with the progressives against the conservatives. But a complicated inversion has taken place in American life over the past two decades, in academia and business and now politics, in which the bold outsiders with an idea are the ones who win seats on corporate boards, invitations to Davos, political influence — the contrarians are the establishment. There is quite literally no club that would not have Bill Ackman as a member.

And yet what Ackman seems to be after is greater validation than that. There has been an unexpectedly fervent, ideological strain that has run through Ackman’s Herbalife campaign —the insistence that he is not just out to make money for himself and his investors, but that he is defending something, a principle. “I believe [Herbalife] is harming millions of low-income people over the world,” Ackman told the conference call yesterday, when asked about how long he intended to pursue his campaign against Herbalife. “As a philanthropic matter I will pursue this to the end of the earth.”

A “philanthropic matter” — that’s a strange way for Ackman to talk about even part of the motivation for a trade in which his fund has taken a $1 billion stake. And yet it is the same tone Ackman has struck throughout the episode, so frequently that it seems likely to betray something. Perhaps part of the reason for the curious intensity of his campaign against Herbalife is that it means something more to Ackman than simply more money and prominence, that it represents the chance to prove that the pirate Establishment, as chaotic as it is, can be a force for something greater than efficiency — that it can be what the old Establishment aspired to be, a force for social good.###1366||Empty###1367||Empty###1368||Empty###1369||A roundup of trading on major world markets:

The Longmont-based earth-imagery company deployed its FirstLook service on Sunday, directing two of its five satellites to snap photos of the area in the Gulf of Thailand, where investigators suspected the plane may have crashed, and then activated its crowdsourcing platform, Tomnod, on Monday afternoon.

Flight MH370, with 239 people on board, lost communication while on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The missing plane continued to perplex investigators from around the globe three days later.

“If there is something to see on the surface (of the water), we will see it. But the question is if we are looking in the right area,” said Luke Barrington, DigitalGlobe’s senior manager of geospatial big data.

As each new theory led to a new dead end, the company recalibrated its action plan based on the Malaysian government’s new area of focus, north and east of oil slicks reported soon after the plane went missing.

DigitalGlobe activates FirstLook — used by emergency-response agencies in natural disasters, manmade crises and human interest scenarios — about twice a week, while Tomnod is used more selectively and for different reasons, Barrington said.

“We try to use the crowd wisely and not tire them out,” he said. “The story here is much more about the search than it is about the response. This whole feeling of not knowing, the lack of information or ability to do anything, we have seen time and again, is why people want to get involved.”

Within the first hour Monday afternoon, the Tomnod map had 60,000 page views with more than a thousand tags. Ten minutes later, that was up to nearly 2,000.

Barrington said that the crowd actually directed the company on this particular crisis, asking for them to deploy Tomnod.

“The people who come to Tomnod are very motivated to solve problems,” Barrington said. “I would say we will have up to 10,000 contributors on this one.”

DigitalGlobe is not the only earth-imagery company capable of delivering high-resolution images, but is arguably the U.S. industry leader.

“There are an awful lot of assets up in orbit,” said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at The Teal Group. “There’s dozens of earth observation satellites and all of them are very, very capable. If they are taking images, then there’s no lack of imagery. And if you haven’t been able to spot something by now, then I don’t know. It has been three days.”

A Pentagon official quoted by ABC news said that the warship USS Kidd is moving to the Indian Ocean, following an “indication” that the MH370 flight could have crashed on Saturday in the area.

The vessel would take more than 24 hours to arrive at the spot, according the same source.

Earlier in the day, a search by two Vietnamese aircraft responding to information provided by a Chinese satellite failed to locate objects suspected of being wreckage from missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370.

Aircraft repeatedly circled the area over the South China Sea but were unable to detect any objects, according to a Reuters journalist who flew aboard a Antonov 26 cargo plane for three hours as part of the search.

Vietnamese and Malaysian planes were scanning waters where a Chinese government agency website said a satellite had photographed three “suspicious floating objects” on Sunday.

The location was close to where the plane lost contact with air traffic control.

The search for the missing jetliner expanded on Wednesday to cover a swathe of Southeast Asia, from the South China Sea to India’s territorial waters, with authorities no closer to explaining what happened to the plane with 239 people on board.

During a new press conference on Thursday, the Malaysian transport minister denied all the latest reports on the missing plane’s possible location, including the Chinese satellite photos. The minister said they had been “released by accident”. He also denied a Wall Street Journal report that the aircraft could have flown for several hours after disappearing from radars on Saturday.

The official assured reporters that “Malaysia has nothing to hide” and the search efforts will continue to be focused on the South China Sea.###1378||Empty###1379||The virtual currency known as Bitcoin is likely here to stay. Not in its current form, not after its many problems were cast in stark relief by the collapse of Mt. Gox, formerly the world’s largest bitcoin bank. It famously lost all $500 million-plus worth of the Bitcoins its clients had on deposit when hackers attacked its website. The spectacular blowout at the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox on Feb. 28, the site had been plagued for months by abrupt shutdowns and other technical woes, was preceded weeks earlier by the arrest of BitInstant founder Charles Shrem, whose Bitcoin bank is accused of facilitating drug transactions on Silk Road, a notorious and now-defunct Internet black market for illicit drug sales.

Virtual currency is here to stay, says David Olive, whether it exists as a Bitcoin or in some other form. ( MINDY SCHAUER, / MCT )

And the demise of Mt. Gox has been followed by a robbery, by hackers, of an estimated $600,000 (U.S.) worth of Bitcoins from the Alberta Bitcoin bank Flexcoin. It also came to light this week that Autumn Radtke, 28-year-old CEO of Singapore-based Bitcoin exchange First Meta, had died of “unnatural” causes on the day Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy. Bitcoin, which holds the promise of becoming the world’s first global currency, is for now easily mocked. It is just four years old. It is almost wholly unregulated. It is backed neither by central banks nor national treasuries. And there is no Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. or its equivalent elsewhere to make good on, for instance, the half-billion-dollars worth of Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox. By April of last year, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions had reached 70,000, remarkable for a currency that debuted in 2009. But the estimated total value of Bitcoin transactions was a mere $2 billion — not even a rounding error in a global economy of $72 trillion. The value of Bitcoins has been hugely volatile, even by the standards of the most volatile commodities. In the first four months of last year, the value of a Bitcoin gyrated wildly, from $13 to $266, before suddenly plunging more than 60 per cent. Yet by November of last year, the Bitcoin’s value had recovered to set a record high of more than $1,200, before stumbling to its current value of $525 or so in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox debacle. Rank speculation is behind that volatility, giving the not-ready-for-prime-time currency a reputation in “proper” circles of “Trading tulips in real time,” the comparison with 18th-century Tulipmania to the Bitcoin phenomenon used by Art Cashin, a veteran broker at the giant Swiss-based traditional bank UBS AG.

And yet, and yet. Few merchants price their goods in Bitcoins — how could they, given their volatility? — but a surprisingly large number of online merchants now accept Bitcoins as payment. Such merchants are protected by firms like Utah’s BitPay, which collects the Bitcoins owed to its 4,500 merchants and other clients, and forwards to them conventional cash, taking on itself the risk of Bitcoin value volatility. To be sure, the Bitcoin exists in the same cultish ethos as gold, whose most zealous adulators believe today’s “fiat” money, as they deride the stuff printed and backed by governments, could become worthless by government whim. Mind you, it’s the same rapture felt by the early evangelists of the PC and later the Internet, who turned out to be so close to the mark in their forecasts that this new century is defined as the Information Age.

Bitcoins have so far existed at the margins of mainstream economics. And so it hasn’t been readily apparent, as perhaps it should be, that some form of global economic currency is the inevitable next step in a globally interconnected financial system in which millions of transactions and trillions of dollars each day have long taken place in pixels, not cash. Electronic banking as a Main Street reality made its advent about a decade ago and e-commerce has followed, adopted by an increasing number of vendors as varied as florists, apparel merchants and car dealerships. Why not an electronic currency, recognized worldwide, to fill out what’s already an overwhelmingly electronic financial world? The early champions of Bitcoin are a diverse group. They include the major institutional investor Fortress Investment Group, which manages $62 billion in conventional investments; venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a heavy investor in Bitcoin-related startups who is still best-known for having helped pioneer Netscape, the first reliable Internet browser; and the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, Bitcoin venture investors last seen being outfoxed by Mark Zuckerberg in the Facebook docudrama The Social Network. A motley crew, possibly. But also arguing in Bitcoin’s defence is Robert Shiller. The Yale economist was among the few to predict the dot-com collapse in the late 1990s, and among the fewer still to warn of the unprecedented U.S. housing collapse that triggered the Great Recession. “Something good can arise from [Bitcoin’s] innovations — even if the results are very different from its current form,” Shiller wrote in a New York Times essay on the heels of the Mt. Gox implosion, when there were obvious doubts about the nascent currency’s future. “Electronic forms of money could give us better pricing, contracting and risk management.” To this point, the Bitcoin has had a Wild West feel to it. But regulators in Europe, Japan and the U.S. are moving quickly in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox collapse to rein in Bitcoin trading, requiring Bitcoin banks and trading houses to make detailed records of trades and report high-value transactions just as conventional financial institutions are required to do. The improvements in financial-transaction activity that Bitcoin has identified are undeniably attractive. You can access your Bitcoin account with your 12-character password using your smartphone or other computing device from anywhere on the planet at any time of day. And there are no transaction costs. Commercial banks make most of their profits from transaction fees — you’ve likely noticed it can cost you $21.50 to withdraw $20 from an ATM. It’s estimated that payments and other banking transactions will generate $1.1 trillion a year in a decade’s time, about double the current amount. That’s a lot of honey to attract techies who can design a new payments system that strips out the speculators and standardizes payments across today’s multitude of national currencies. Indeed, the durability of peer-to-peer Internet sharing of music and movies is a comparison often made to the inevitability of electronic currency that removes the middleman and his cut. Cameron Winklevoss claims that “To shut down Bitcoin, you’d have to shut down the Internet.” Well, no. But if a means can be perfected of curbing the proliferation of banking fees, one would have some difficulty silencing the clamour for that kind of progress.

WASHINGTON — In Maine, the insurer that has enrolled the most Affordable Care Act customers isn’t the state’s well-established Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, owned by WellPoint Inc. It’s WellPoint’s only rival: Maine Community Health Options, a startup that didn’t exist three years ago.

The newcomer, funded primarily by taxpayer money lent under the U.S. health care law, has won about 80 percent of the market so far in Maine’s new insurance exchange, exceeding its own expectations, said Kevin Lewis, the chief executive officer.

Health law opponents predicted early on that insurance co-ops created by the law would fail, and that much of the $2.1 billion they were loaned to get started would be lost. Instead, the 23 co-ops that now exist nationally have enrolled about 300,000 people in health plans by combining low premiums with a certain homespun appeal, according to company executives.

“We’re doing really well,” Lewis said in a telephone interview. Taxpayers face “no risk whatsoever” that Maine Community will go under, he said. “A lot of those early, dire concerns just need to be re-examined.”

Kristin Binns, a spokeswoman for Indianapolis, Ind.-based WellPoint, declined to comment on her company’s co-op competition.

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act refers to these new companies as “Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans,” or co-ops. To be sure, not all of the new companies have thrived. Some, such as Maryland’s, have struggled to sign people up because of problems with their state’s exchange while others, including Michigan, have set their premiums too high.

The successful co-ops “emerged as price leaders,” responsible for more than a third of the lowest-premium plans offered on U.S. exchanges, according to an October report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co.

Executives from these nonprofit groups in part credit innovative benefit designs for their success, including features that offer free doctors’ visits and generic drugs, and even $100 gift cards for people who get an annual physical. In Wisconsin, many customers of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative appreciate the company’s nonprofit, member-governed business model, CEO Bob DeVita said.

“There’s a long-standing upper Midwest tradition with co- ops,” DeVita said in a telephone interview. “I think there was a lot of pent-up demand for that.”

In Windsor Heights, Iowa, 35-year-old Geoffrey Wood, the chief operating officer of Startup Genome, said he signed on for the state’s co-op, CoOportunity Health, because he had grown tired of dealing with his previous insurer, Aetna Inc.’s subsidiary Coventry Health Care Inc.

“Given the choice between them, as the incumbent company, and an innovative company trying to do something different, I didn’t feel like I had much choice,” Wood said in a telephone interview. “I decided to give the new guy a shot.”

Cynthia Michener, an spokeswoman for Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna, said Coventry’s advantages for enrollees include experience with the Iowa health-care system and stability. She declined to discuss Wood’s case without authorization from him.

“Coventry Health Care has served Iowans for more than two decades, and knows the community and its health-care needs well,” Michener said in an email. “We have long-standing experience of providing health insurance and benefits and helping members access care, and a track record of financial stability to pay claims.”

About 4 million Americans have signed up for private health plans using new marketplaces created by the law, the U.S. government says. The Congressional Budget Office projects 6 million will enroll this year, a reduction of 1 million from estimates before the troubled introduction of the law began in October.

It hasn’t been a smooth road for some of the co-ops. The computer bugs and errors that prevented many Americans from signing up for coverage in October and November took a toll and, in some states, the startups continue to struggle.

Co-ops in Maryland, Oregon and Massachusetts, for instance, haven’t hit their target enrollments because their state-run exchanges still aren’t functioning well. And Vermont’s co-op dissolved in September, returning its federal solvency loans, after state regulators denied it an insurance license, saying the company’s enrollment expectations were unrealistic and its proposed rates weren’t competitive.

“They’re finding their way to us off the exchange, fortunately,” Dawn Bonder, CEO of Oregon’s Health Republic Insurance, one of two co-ops in the state, said in a phone interview. She estimated the company signed up about 4 percent to 5 percent of customers using Oregon’s exchange, which had enrolled about 33,800 people by February, according to the U.S. government.

“We’re looking at 2015 as an opportunity to just do what we hoped to do in 2014 — but with a lot of experience under our belt,” she said.

At the same time, co-ops in Michigan and Tennessee haven’t grown at the rate of peers because they initially over-priced their plans relative to competitors, spokesmen for the companies said.

“2014 is preparation, really, for ’15,” said David Eich, a spokesman for Consumers Mutual, the Michigan co-op, in a telephone interview. “We’re going to be really engaged back on the individual market.” He said the company isn’t in danger of going out of business.

About 16 percent of the loans are for the co-ops’ start-up expenses, such as leasing office space and hiring staff, and must be repaid in five years. The rest is to be saved to meet state regulatory requirements for insurers’ financial reserves, and is due in 15 years.

Some Republicans, meanwhile, still contend taxpayers remain at risk of losing much of the money loaned to the companies. At a Feb. 5 hearing on the co-ops, Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma called the program “an investment disaster,” and said there remains “the possibility that American taxpayers will be left on the hook.”

Along with Maine, co-ops have attained large market share in New York, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Kentucky, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Utah, Montana, Nevada and New Mexico, said John Morrison, a board member and founding president of the co-op trade group, and other executives.

New York’s co-op, Republic Insurance of New York, which was founded by the same organization, Freelancers Union, that started Bonder’s company in Oregon, is probably the largest in the country, with more than 50,000 members. It was second in market share to WellPoint’s Empire brand on the state’s exchange as of the end of December, according to data from the exchange, New York State of Health.

Federal authorities have approved plans by the co-ops in Montana, Massachusetts and Kentucky to expand into neighboring states next year — Idaho, New Hampshire and West Virginia, respectively. The companies have received a total of $113 million for their expansion plans, according to a government budget document published March 4.

For a handful of co-ops, success has raised a new concern. If they enroll many more customers than they expected, they could run afoul of state regulators who require companies to maintain cash reserves sufficient to cover medical claims in the event they go out of business. All the co-ops received multimillion dollar loans from the government to fund solvency reserves, and the size of each loan was based on projected enrollment.

The Iowa co-op, CoOportunity, which also serves Nebraska, has signed up about 54,000 members, after projecting it would enroll just 11,800 by the end of March, said Cliff Gold, the chief operations officer.

“We do have concerns about the solvency loans if we continue to grow at this rate,” Gold said. The co-op was signing up as many as 1,000 people a week in February, he said.

The co-ops have lobbied the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which controls the loans, to make more money available for reserves. Congress capped spending on the co-ops as part of a budget deal in January 2013, leaving $253 million in a “contingency fund for oversight and assistance” to the firms, according to another budget document published March 4.

“While it’s still early, we are encouraged by what we have seen so far, and we will continue to work closely with these co- ops to monitor their progress and assess their performance,” a spokesman for the agency, Aaron Albright, said in an e-mail.

If the co-ops continue to grow, Obama administration officials have promised to support them, Morrison said. Morrison and co-op executives met with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other top administration health officials at the White House on Feb. 6 to brief them on their progress.

The officials told the companies that “if co-ops continue to perform well in the years ahead, the administration will look to expand the availability of co-ops into the remaining states that don’t currently have them,” Morrison said.###1381||Empty###1382||Hedge fund activist Bill Ackman fired off his latest salvo against Herbalife Tuesday, saying the company breaks Chinese pyramid-scheme law by disguising forbidden multilevel recruitment rewards as “consultation” fees.

The 2 ¹/₂ hour presentation came a day after a scathing front-page article in The New York Times attacked Ackman’s efforts in lobbying for an investigation of Herbalife by regulators. He spent about 10 minutes at the start of the conference call/webcast rebutting it.

The article, he said, “is not my favorite,” but in his characteristic positive spin, added “No regulator in the world is not aware of the issues around Herbalife” as a result.

China is Herbalife’s fastest growing market and became controversial earlier this year when Chinese news reports of pyramid activity at other multilevel marketing companies caused Herbalife’s shares to plummet. They fell 1.16 percent after Ackman’s findings were revealed Tuesday, to close at $65.39.

Ackman’s China presentation showed Herbalife’s compensation plan in China mirrors that of the US, but consulting fees are used to get around its more stringent pyramid laws prohibiting payment for recruitment.

Chinese distributors told Ackman’s investigators that while Herbalife calls the compensation an hourly consulting fee, the amount isn’t determined by hours worked.

“Hourly consulting pay is spot on in violation of the law because it’s keyed to the number of people and sales of people below you,” said Ackman. Herbalife is in violation of both civil and criminal laws in China, his attorney David Klafter alleged.

Thirteen-hundred people dialed into the webcast/call.

Ackman also showed internal Herbalife documents he has received from one of several company employees who’ve gained whistleblower status and are cooperating with US regulators. They reveal that Herbalife uses the same type of recruiting awards in China as in the US — with an additional China bonus. US financial statements call them “sales employee expenses” for China.

“They’re trying to hide the fact that the China royalty expenses move in lock step with the rest of the world,” Ackman said.

The Los Angeles-based company said it follows local laws in China.

Ackman fielded almost 100 questions during the presentation and promised more evidence: a documentary on victims, another webcast on nutrition clubs and one on Herbalife’s Venezuela operations.###1383||New York: US stocks slipped on Monday as weak economic data from China and Japan raised questions about the growth outlook in Asia.

Sens. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a joint press release that they would release legislative text in upcoming days that would closely mirror an existing bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators on the committee, led by Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Bob Corker, R-Tenn.

Both bills would wind down and eliminate the mortgage behemoths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were taken into federal conservatorship after failing in 2008 and have remained in the government's control since. In recent months, the two companies have returned to profitability, so far yielding the government more in dividends than the $187.5 billion it cost to bail them out.

Both senate measures would also institute a Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, modeled on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that provides depositors' insurance for banks. The FMIC would provide insurance on approved mortgage-backed securities that would only kick in once the private owners of those securities had suffered some losses. The FMIC would be intended to ensure a liquid market for mortgage securities while also avoiding taxpayer losses on guaranteed loans.

Investing.com - Gold prices rallied to the highest level since September on Wednesday, as demand for safe haven assets was supported by lingering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,363.20 a troy ounce, the most since September 20.

Gold last traded at $1,358.20 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.85%, or $11.10. Gold picked up 0.39%, or $5.20 an ounce, on Tuesday to settle at $1,346.70.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,366.50, the high from September 20.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery rallied 1.2%, or $0.25 cents, to trade at $21.06 a troy ounce. Silver ended Tuesday's session down 0.45%, or $0.09 cents, to settle at $20.81 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was to travel to the U.S. to meet President Barack Obama on Wednesday, as diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continued.

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the week for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release closely-watched data on retail sales for February on Thursday and a report on consumer sentiment on Friday.

Data released last week showed that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.

The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures extended losses from the previous session to hit a daily low of $2.918 a pound, the weakest since July 2010.

What? You were expecting a pun?

"Marijuana raised $3.5 million in taxes and fees for Colorado in the first month of legal sales. That's in a report just released by the State Department of Revenue." (Via KUSA)

The total sales for recreational pot hit $14 million. Of that, the state collected $2 million. The other $1.5 million in taxes came from medical marijuana sales. (Via CBS)

According to the Los Angeles Times, the revenue came from three taxes: a 10 percent retail sales tax, a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent state sales tax.

As good as the numbers sound, a writer for The Atlantic isn't impressed, saying: "Governor John Hickenlooper's 2014-2015 budget predicted about $98 million in sales taxes, with $40 million set aside for school construction. At the current rate Colorado won't even reach that level."

An executive director of the Department of Revenue told Bloomberg something different, though, saying: "The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations. We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts."

Either way, the numbers were enough to convince Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom of California that there are benefits to legalizing marijuana. He told KCBS:

"Somehow we can demonstrate some real conviction on this. Because I know a lot of Republicans up in Sacramento agree on this. We don't need to go to the voters, we can legislate this."

For Colorado though, it seems like everyone wants a piece of the sales.

While $40 million is already committed to schools, Al Jazeera reports state police chiefs are asking for more money. A member of the Joint Budget Committee said, "The whole world wants to belly up to this trough."

The proportion of urbanites who hold household registration will increase to about 45 percent at the end of 2020, up from 35.7 percent of 2013, which means around 100 million migrant people will settle down with equal access to public services in cities.

This week, the company confirmed that the price of a Prime subscription will rise by $20 to $99, starting next week for new sign-ups and next month for renewals.

Amazon shareholders seemed to like the move, sending Amazon stock up on a down day for the market. However, while the Prime price increase should improve Amazon's earnings somewhat, that won't necessarily lead to good results for shareholders. Any decrease in Amazon's revenue growth from people who drop Prime could cause severe multiple contraction, more than offsetting earnings growth.

The case for a price increase

When Szkutak announced the potential price increase in late January, he stated that Prime usage and shipping costs have been rising for years. However, in the program's nine-year history, Amazon had never raised the price. A price increase would offset Amazon's rising Prime-related expenses.

Many analysts -- including The Motley Fool's own David Hanson -- think virtually all current Prime members will accept the price increase. Bullish analysts argue that Prime customers get a lot of value out of the service.

Furthermore, $99 is a very reasonable price considering all of the features that come with a Prime membership, including free two-day shipping on most items, free access to books in the Kindle Lending Library, and more than 40,000 streaming movies and TV episodes through Prime Instant Video.

If everybody is willing to pay an extra $20, then there is no downside to raising prices. In fact, by demonstrating its long-term pricing power, Amazon would give investors greater certainty about its ability to deliver huge profits in the decades ahead.

The flip side

However, what if some current Prime members aren't willing to pay an extra $20 a year? Many Amazon Prime members have stated that they won't renew if the price increases.

It's true that people often don't follow up on their stated intentions from a survey. However, these surveys have found that about half of all Prime members would not renew at a higher price.

If just 10% of Amazon's Prime membership base decides to drop the service rather than pay more, this would have a noticeable impact on revenue growth. The law of large numbers is already starting to cut into Amazon's growth rate. Any loss of Prime subscribers would aggravate this trend.

To be clear, the risk isn't that Amazon's revenue suddenly stops growing. However, analysts are currently expecting the company to post revenue growth of approximately 20% for the next two years. If Amazon's revenue growth instead drops to 15% by next year, the stock would probably warrant a lower earnings multiple.

A Prime price increase might bring in an extra $300 million to $400 million of "free" revenue next year, according to analyst Mark Mahaney. After tax, that would add around $0.40-$0.50 to Amazon's earnings -- not very much at all compared with Amazon's roughly $370 stock price. The downside risk from multiple contraction is a lot greater than the upside from profit growth.

A familiar sight

The gushing about Amazon's price increase from bullish analysts reminds me of the 2011 Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) price increase. By now, many people may have forgotten that Netflix stock peaked at more than $300 the day after Netflix announced its price increase. At the time, analysts were bullish on the potential for higher prices to boost Netflix's profit margins.

Netflix stock eventually made it back to $300 (and beyond), but only after investors got a huge scare -- and many probably dumped their Netflix stock when it was well below its July 2011 high. Analysts simply underestimated how many customers would drop Netflix over a $6-a-month (or 60%) price increase.

Of course, Amazon is not raising the Prime price by 60%. While its 25% price increase is risky, a 50% increase to $119 would have been far more likely to chase away subscribers. Still, the "Netflix 2011" scenario may repeat itself in miniature with Amazon over the next year or two. A slowdown in revenue growth below 20% could make a lot of investors more wary of Amazon's sky-high valuation.

Foolish conclusion

Amazon's decision to raise the Prime membership price should boost the company's profitability, but not in a "game-changing" way. On the other hand, if enough people drop Prime that Amazon's revenue growth slows, Amazon stock could take a big hit, as its valuation is driven by investors' expectations for rapid revenue growth.

Thus, while there is potential upside for Amazon investors if revenue growth continues without a blip, the potential downside is a lot more significant. Amazon's decision to raise the Prime price is the riskiest move it has made in many years.###1396||You are the owner of this article.###1397||Two of the world’s oldest fruit suppliers are joining forces via a $1.1bn (£660m) all-share merger to create the biggest banana business on the planet.

North Carolina-based Chiquita Brands and Dublin-headquartered Fyffes said they were creating a fresh produce company employing 32,000 people in more than 70 countries, with $4.6bn of annual sales.

The enlarged group, 50.7pc-owned by Chiquita shareholders and 49.3pc by Fyffes, will sell more than 160m boxes of bananas a year as well as having significant clout in the world of melons, pineapples and packaged salads.

The new group aims, it said, to capitalise on “the growing fresh food business and health and wellness trends by more effectively utilising its geographical footprint and expanded distribution channels”.

“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes,” said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita’s chief executive, who will chair the new ChiquitaFyffes business. It will be listed on the New York stock exchange and domiciled in Ireland.

News of the deal sent shares in Fyffes rocketing 40 cents to €1.29 in Dublin, its highest level since 2000, with the transaction valuing the company at €1.22 a share, a 38pc premium to Friday’s closing price.

Shares in Chiquita also jumped, rising more than 12pc to $12.15, as the market warmed to a mooted $40m of annual synergies by the end of 2016, not from job cuts but savings on shipping, packaging and procurement.

The merger combines two groups steeped in history. Fyffes dates back to the 1880s when EW Fyffe Son & Co took its first delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands.

Its more recent history has seen the involvement of three generations of the family of executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the combined group.

His grandfather, Charles McCann, started a green grocer’s shop in Dundalk in the early 1900s, becoming the first agent for Fyffes bananas in Ireland. His son, Neil McCann, subsequently built the fruit import business that acquired Fyffes in 1986.

Hailing the deal as “transformative”, David McCann said the “larger, more diverse business” offered more “opportunities for growth”. Balkan Investment Company, the vehicle for the McCann family’s 12.5pc stake, has given irrevocable undertakings to vote for the deal.

Another Fyffes investor, the Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust with 13.1pc of the shares, is also expected to back the merger.

Chiquita started importing fruit more than 140 years ago, when Captain Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica, sailed to Jersey City in 11 days and sold them for a profit.

One potential banana skin remains in the shape of the competition authorities as only four companies – Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Fresh Del Monte Produce – control more than 80pc of the global banana trade.###1398||Sponsored

Ackman reportedly launched an investigation to the Cayman Islands-based company's operations in China and his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management LP, tapped OTG Research for the probe, Bloomberg said.

According to the results of the probe, Herbalife's unit in China had been paying people illegally based on the number of recruits that they get. Moreover, Herbalife's hourly consulting pay was allegedly the key that would show the nutrition company violated direct-selling laws in China.

"They defraud millions of people. Their portrayal of their China business in their SEC filings is materially false and misleading," Ackman said during the presentation.

In a response to Ackman's latest claims against the company, Herbalife issued a statement, which read, "Herbalife remains confident in its business in China, which is built on customers enjoying and benefiting from our nutrition products each and every day. We will continue to invest in this important market and collaborate with the Chinese government to deliver high-quality nutrition to the Chinese consumer through lawful direct selling practices. The presentation reflects Mr. Ackman's continued failure to fundamentally understand Herbalife's business model."

Bloomberg said the probe by Ackman's Pershing is the latest condemnation of Herbalife by Ackman. Herbalife is known as a vitamins, skin creams and meal-replacement shakes maker, of which Ackman claimed that its operations is one big pyramid scheme. Herbalife has since denied Ackman's claims.

In December 2012, Ackman revealed that his firm had short-sold over 20 million of Herbalife's shares in the company. The news agency said this means that should Herbalife decline, Pershing stands to gain. Ackman said in the presentation that investors of Pershing could gain $2 billion should the nutrition company fold up today. Bloomberg said two-thirds of Ackman's firm's investment in Herbalife is in options.###1400||Ukraine is a complicated question worldwide. It is a relatively large Eastern European economy – certainly the biggest, after Russia, among the former Soviet Republics. It is also a major natural gas conduit for sales of Russian natural gas from Russia to the European Union.

As such, it’s important to Russia, not just as a transit point for natural gas to its biggest customers in Europe, but also as a large economy that exports a lot of its agricultural products, its workers and its steel to Russia. Having an economy such as this in the Russian-led customs union would lend legitimacy to an organization the Russians have been trying to transform into a European Union-type economic alliance.

In this post I’m going to attempt to lay out some issues, as well as some possible outcomes and solutions.

First, let’s get something straight. There have been rumblings that the U.S. government has somehow been funding the protesters in Ukraine, hoping to topple the corrupt, pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. This is a silly idea. Why would the United States work to create a power vacuum? Why would the United States want to facilitate the rise to power of Julia Timoshenko, who by many accounts is just as corrupt as Yanukovych AND has ties to organized crime? It doesn’t make sense.

The protests were peaceful until the Ukrainian parliament (the Rada) passed a law criminalizing protests and demonstrations, ostensibly because Yanukovych saw how unpopular his decision to turn away from an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) was, and decided that it would be wise to shut the demonstrators up. Why would the U.S. want to complicate the situation by funding violence? The only nation with anything to gain from the violence would be Russia, because the violence would give Russians an excuse to intervene under the guise of protecting the large number of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine.

But let’s not speculate about who funded the violence. The only reason I mention this is because I’ve been reading Internet sites (run by people commonly described as “conspiritards”) who are spreading rumors about U.S. involvement in the protests – a party line commonly advanced by Russia itself, whose leadership don’t want to draw attention to their own behavior that led to the protests in the first place.

When Russia began putting massive economic pressure on Ukraine and promising loans and lower natural gas prices to the cash strapped country, while implementing trade barriers and pressuring Ukraine to pay its debts immediately to the Russian company Gazprom, this had to have been a major reason for Yanukovych’s sudden turn to Russia and rejection of the West – even though at least half the country wanted closer ties to the West – or at least a national referendum, rather than a unilateral decision forced by Russian pressure.

Now, the Russians have entered the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea – an autonomous republic in Ukraine under the pretext of protecting their military assets (the Russian Black Sea fleet is based there) and protecting the ethnic Russians in the area. The government of Crimea, which has already voted to secede, has also set a mid-March date for a popular referendum on separating from Ukraine and joining Russia. At the same time, the Crimean constitution defers to the Ukrainian constitution on matters that affect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and the Crimean parliament has no right of legislative initiative.

So what does this all mean?

From what I see here, this is a Ukrainian national issue. This is an issue between Russia and Ukraine. This is an issue in which the United States has no right to directly interfere.

We have no right to involve ourselves in Ukraine’s constitutional matters. We should not interfere in any negotiations between Russia and Ukraine (although the Russians refuse to negotiate with the new interim government of Ukraine, claiming they are extreme right nationalists). And to those legislators in Congress demanding sanctions, I have to ask – against whom?

Last week’s Executive Order blocking property of persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine names no one, and “technically,” even though pro-Russian troops have entered Crimea, Russia can claim “pro-Russian” doesn’t mean “officially” Russian. All this at a time when the nation is war-weary, is cutting defense spending and has no appetite for another military action – especially one that does not involve it directly.

Military action is not and should not be an option right now. Economic and energy chess, however, is another story. Russia has threatened to cut off supplies of natural gas to Europe. Oil and natural gas exports comprise nearly 60 percent of Russia’s total export market.

Can the U.S. export enough natural gas to Europe to make Russia’s natural gas threat irrelevant there?

Probably not, because we don’t have the infrastructure quite yet.

We do, however, have a large petroleum strategic reserve, which we can open to sales on the global market, which would hit Russia where it hurts most. Granted, this doesn’t help the EU’s natural gas problem, but the economic pressure on Russia may force Putin to reconsider the natural gas threat.

It’s a thought. I’m not saying it’s the solution, but it’s certainly a more viable one than the impotent Congressional screeches for sanctions or the neocon demands for military mobilization.

Ultimately, though, we need to allow the people of Ukraine to solve their own issues, observe the trends closely and act accordingly, if needed.###1401||Bouygues increases its offer for SFR

By Mary Lennighan, Total Telecom

Thursday 13 March 14

French telco's new bid adds €1 billion to its valuation of SFR, showing how much it needs to win Vivendi over.

Bouygues on Thursday demonstrated just how desperate it is to acquire SFR when it announced that it had upped the cash element of its bid by €800 million. The French conglomerate is now offering Vivendi €11.3 billion in cash to take control of its SFR unit, which it hopes to merge with Bouygues Telecom to create a stronger competitor in the mobile market. However, it has reduced the stake in the combined entity that it is prepared to cede to Vivendi to 43% from 46%…

The Alibaba IPO is expected to be one of the largest of all time. It could raise more than the $16 billion Facebook scooped up in its 2012 IPO — and if it doesn’t it’s bound to come close. Analysts believe the company could reach a valuation north of $130 billion.

The e-commerce giant had been rumored to be pushing for an IPO in New York, as opposed to Hong Kong.

Alibaba is often compared to Amazon, but with so many working parts, it also resembles sections of PayPal and Google. The huge portion of its revenue comes from product purchases; the company generated a massive $2.8 billion in net income through September, according to quarterly filings by Yahoo, with revenue in that period amounting to $6.7 billion. Total gross merchandise traded on Alibaba last year was around $240 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal — more than double Amazon’s roughly $100 billion.

Those numbers have all of Wall Street salivating. All the major banks are reportedly jockeying for a leading role in the IPO. At least five — Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley — are expected to work with Alibaba on the IPO.

In choosing New York, Alibaba has snubbed its hometown market, but the company’s statement referenced the possibility of a dual listing at some future date. (We’ve included the full statement below.)

Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States. This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals. Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China. We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group. We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.

In the press conference this morning presided over by Li during the on-going annual conference of the National People's Congress, one third of the media's questions were about the economy and financial sector and reform.

A Reuters reporter asked what were the biggest challenges to realize the 7.7 percent economic growth last year and what are the pressing issues for Li to solve now?

"The downward pressure for Chinese economic growth is the largest challenge last year," Li said.

The central government's revenue even registered a negative growth. There are money shortages in the financial sector, and the interbank lending rate exceeded 13 percent. There is also a slump in electricity consumption and cargo transportation volume.

There are views saying the Chinese economy will suffer a hard-landing and the slide may be 3 to 4 percent.

"We have very limited space to carry out fiscal and monetary policies. The macro-control confronts multiple difficulties," Li noted.

"It takes wisdom to solve difficulties. We keep old, effective ways and innovate new solutions and thoughts. We make it clear what is the reasonable range for economic operation."

He pointed out that growth and employment should not dip below the lower limit. Inflation should not exceed the upper limit.

"We should try to deepen reform, adjust the structure and play up the market's role. We shoulder the pressure and realized the main targets of economic growth," he said.

"We should first grind the ax before cutting firewood. We squarely face the difficulties and challenges, draw on advantages and avoid disadvantages. This is how we overcome difficulties," Li added.

"The Chinese economy has huge potential and flexibility. We have the ability and conditions to keep this year's economic operation within the reasonable range."###1406||Why did this happen?

Threadneedle Street embarked on the unprecedented policy of quantitative easing — buying up government debt with electronically created money — in the depths of the recession five years ago as the Monetary Policy Committee slashed interest rates to an all-time low of 0.5%.

Questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee over reversing the policy, Carney said the eventual sale of its gilt stocks would have an “impact” on debt markets but added: “We’re not going to sell £375 billion of gilts. That’s a hypothetical question, purely hypothetical.”

The Canadian added that the “world has changed” and that the size of the Bank’s balance sheet — swollen by the gilt purchases — would be “materially” larger going forward.

Carney added that he did not expect the process of unwinding QE to begin until there had been “several adjustments” in interest rates — suggesting it could take years.

He wants to have the flexibility to cut interest rates again should the recovery hit a sudden hurdle. It would be “more difficult” to adjust QE, but “interest rates are something we could move quickly”.

Carney said his personal view was that there was more slack in the labour market than the 1%-1.5% central view of the MPC. Rate-setter Martin Weale meanwhile said the rapid slide in unemployment towards the Bank’s current 7% threshold for forward guidance had “reinforced” his doubts over the policy.###1409||The promise of quality, affordable health care is quickly becoming reality for more and more Americans.

"Money from Comcast’s political action committee has flowed to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee," including its antitrust subcommittee leaders, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).

"The cable giant has donated in some way to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is planning a hearing of its own. And Comcast has canvassed the two congressional panels that chiefly regulate cable, broadband and other telecom issues, donating to practically every lawmaker there — including Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.)."

A Comcast spokeswoman told Politico that many of these reps represent districts where Comcast provides cable, Internet and phone service, and "it is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process...

"The company spent more than $3.5 million during 2011 and 2012 on a slew of Democratic and Republican candidates, and it has shelled out just under $2 million already in the 2014 cycle, according to federal records. That’s in addition to millions of dollars of lobbying — and big donations to charitable causes and groups — that Comcast has committed to Washington annually.

"The company similarly donated to lawmakers and lobbied aggressively on Capitol Hill before winning the government’s permission in 2011 to buy NBCUniversal. A stable of congressional allies at the time wrote letters and publicly defended the NBC acquisition...

"Fifteen of the 18 lawmakers who sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold its hearing on March 26, have taken home some form of a Comcast check. Sens. Durbin (D-Ill.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) all are running for reelection this year — and each has Comcast cash to show for it.

"So do [Sens. Ted] Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), as well as the leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust panel, Klobuchar and Lee. Each of those members received Comcast donations this election cycle to their leadership PACs...

"Schumer... secured a commitment from Comcast on the very day of its merger announcement that it would not kill Time Warner Cable jobs in New York. After it was later revealed Schumer’s brother helped orchestrate the deal, the senator pledged he’d recuse himself from the matter...

"The House Judiciary Committee is readying another hearing on Comcast — and many of its members also are familiar with the company’s financial support. Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), for example, has received $15,000 this cycle from Comcast, some for his leadership PAC and the rest for his personal campaign.

"The House Energy and Commerce Committee and its Senate counterpart so far haven’t scheduled their own reviews of the new Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal. But both panels do regulate Comcast by way of their broad jurisdiction over Internet, cable and telephone issues... The company has given to 50 of 54 of the House committee’s Democrats and Republicans, donating either to their reelection campaigns or their leadership PACs, according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance data from Jan. 1, 2013 to Jan. 31, 2014. And Comcast has donated in some way to 20 of 24 lawmakers on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee."###1411||Walking along the same lines, the US based mortgage lender, Capital One Financial Corp (NYSE: COF) has not made any changes to its benchmark 30 year fixed mortgage interest rates on March 12, 2014. The bank did not disappoint the potential customers by publishing its ideal fixed and flexible home loan deals against the same lending rates today.

This Wednesday, in the standard, long term home loan section, the 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loans are now listed against a lending charge of 4.375% and an annual percentage yield of 4.378%. However, the short term, 15 year counterpart of the 30 fixed rate mortgage plans are also being traded at the same interest rate of 3.375% and an annual percentage yield of 3.381% today.

The mortgage shoppers, who are looking forward to make an expensive home purchase and are seeking financial assistance from the mortgage lender, can opt for the jumbo versions of the 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loan options, which are now advertised at an interest price of 4.500% and are backed by an annual return rate of 4.501% today. On the other hand, the borrowers interested in taking the short cut can go for the ideal 15 year jumbo fixed rate mortgage packages, which can be grabbed at an interest rate of 3.875% and an APR yield of 3.877% this Wednesday.

As far as the flexible home loan deals are concerned, the bank is currently offering its best 5 year adjustable rate mortgage home loan plans at a lending rate of 3.000% to begin with and an annual percentage return equivalent to 2.839% during the starting years of the home loan tenure. However, the more flexible, 7 year adjustable rate mortgage home loan schemes are up for grabs at an interest cost of 3.250% and an APR yield of 3.041% on the primary amount of home loan sanctioned by the bank.

Mortgage rates published by the banks normally fluctuate depending upon the mortgage backed financial bonds and securities, which are traded in the financial market and are known to follow the stock market movements closely. Towards the end of the trading day, as the stock market lost its ground and left the DJIA index at 15337.70 after a fall of -113.35, Capital One Financial chose to move along the same line for quoting its interest rates. Irrespective of the interest rates, the stock prices COF shares performed somewhat better and increased to a new price point of 67.60 after a hike of +0.59.

Rate/APR terms offered by advertisers may differ from those listed above based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and other differences between an individual loan and the loan criteria used for the quotes.###1412||US Navy SEALs take control of oil tanker hijacked in Libya: Pentagon

Gox that was released on the Internet last week by the hackers who compromised the blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles also contains bitcoin-stealing malware for Windows and Mac.

Security researchers from antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab analyzed the 620MB file called MtGox2014Leak.zip and concluded that in addition to various Mt. Gox-related documents and data, it contains malicious binary files.

[ Learn how to secure your systems with the Web Browser Deep Dive PDF special report and Security Central newsletter, both from InfoWorld. ]

The files masquerade as Windows and Mac versions of a custom, back-office application for accessing the transaction database of Mt. Gox, a large bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Japan in late February after claiming it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins to cyber thieves.

However, they are actually malware programs designed to search and steal Bitcoin wallet files from computers, Kaspersky security researcher Sergey Lozhkin said Friday in a blog post.

Both the Windows and Mac binaries are written in LiveCode, a programming language for developing cross-platform applications.

When executed, they display a graphical interface for what appears to be a Mt. Gox database access tool. However, in the background they launch a process -- TibanneSocket.exe on Windows -- that searches for bitcoin.conf and wallet.dat files on the user's computer, according to Lozhkin. "The latter is a critical data file for a Bitcoin crypto-currency user: if it is kept unencrypted and is stolen, cyber criminals will gain access to all bitcoins the user has in his possession for that specific account."

The malware, which Kaspersky has named Trojan.Win32.CoinStealer.i (the Windows version) and Trojan.OSX.Coinstealer.a (the Mac version), uploads the stolen Bitcoin wallet files to a remote server that used to be located in Bulgaria, but is now offline.

"It seems that the whole leak was invented to infect computers with Bitcoin-stealer malware that takes advantage of people's keen interest in the Mt. Gox topic," Lozhkin said.

"Malware creators often using social engineering tricks and hot discussion topics to spread malware, and this is great example of an attack on a focused target audience," he said.

Users who downloaded the archive and executed any of the binary files inside should probably scan their computers with an anti-malware program and should take immediate steps to secure their bitcoins. According to a scan report Monday on the VirusTotal service, 27 of 47 anti-virus engine detect the Windows binary file as malicious or suspicious.###1417||By Jethro Mullen, CNN

Malaysian officials on Thursday denied a newspaper report that suggested the missing Malaysia Airlines plane may have kept flying for four hours after its last reported contact.

The officials acknowledged the search for the jetliner, which disappeared early Saturday, is becoming harder and harder.

The report from The Wall Street Journal said U.S. aviation investigators and national security officials were basing their belief that the missing plane kept flying on data automatically transmitted to the ground from the passenger jet’s engines.

But Malaysia’s acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the report, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, was “inaccurate.”

Malaysian officials said they had consulted with the makers of the plane and its engines, who told them that no transmissions of any kind were received from the plane after air traffic controllers lost contact with it.

The report threatened to open the door to a fresh round of theories about what has become of the plane, which vanished while flying over Southeast Asia on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Four more hours in the air could have put the plane many hundreds of miles beyond the area currently being searched.

But one aviation industry observer expressed skepticism about the report even before the denials by officials.

“I find this very, very difficult to believe,” Tom Ballantyne, chief correspondent for the magazine Orient Aviation, told CNN. “That this aircraft could have flown on for four hours after it disappeared and not have been picked up by someone’s radar and not have been seen by anyone, it’s almost unbelievable.”

Search getting harder

The mystery over the fate of the passenger jet, a Boeing 777-200, and the 239 people it was carrying has so far left government officials and aviation experts flummoxed.

“With every passing day the task becomes more difficult,” Hishammuddin said Thursday.

Searchers have already been combing a vast area of sea and land for traces of the plane. But so far, with the search well into its sixth day, their efforts have been fruitless.

The Wall Street Journal report said the plane’s engines have an onboard monitoring system supplied by their manufacturer, Rolls-Royce PLC. The system “periodically sends bursts of data about engine health, operations and aircraft movements to facilities on the ground,” the newspaper said.

Malaysia Airlines sends its engine data live to Rolls-Royce for analysis, the report said, and that data is now being analyzed to figure out the flight path of the missing plane after contact was lost with its transponder, a radio transmitter in the cockpit that communicates with ground radar.

But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Thursday that Rolls-Royce and Boeing have reported that they didn’t receive transmissions of any kind after 1:07 a.m. Saturday. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane shortly afterward, around 1:30 a.m.

Erin Atan, a spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce in Asia, declined to comment on the matter, telling CNN it was “an official air accident investigation.”

Still no trace

As word of the report spread, searchers appeared to draw another blank in the so-far frustrating endeavors to find traces of the plane.

Vietnamese and Malaysian planes spotted no sign of debris when they flew over an area of sea that Chinese authorities had flagged as the location of possible remnants of the missing plane, officials said.

China’s State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense had said satellite images showed “three suspected floating objects” that it described as “a suspected crash site.”

But Chinese authorities later said that the release of the satellite images was a mistake and that they didn’t show any debris relating to the plane, Hishammuddin said.

Malaysian officials say they are still trying to determine if a radar blip detected heading west soon after the plane lost contact was in fact the missing jet.

If it was, the plane would have been hundreds of miles off its original flight path and headed in the wrong direction. Malaysian officials say they have asked U.S. experts to help them analyze the radar data.

Meanwhile, India is joining the multinational search, dispatching two of its naval ships off the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands, a military spokesman told CNN on Thursday.

Navy and coast guard aircraft are also expected to be sent toward the Strait of Malacca once “exact coordinates” are received for the search area, Andaman and Nicobar’s joint naval command spokesman Harmeet Singh said.

Last known words

Also on Thursday, a Malaysian aviation official told CNN that the last known words from the flight crew of the missing plane were “All right, good night.”

Malaysian civil aviation officer Zulazri Mohd Ahnuar said he couldn’t confirm which member of the flight crew sent the message, which was transmitted from the plane back to Malaysian flight controllers as the aircraft transferred into Vietnamese airspace early Saturday.

For the families of those on board the missing plane, the wait for news is tortuous.

Danica Weeks is trying to keep it together for her two young sons, though the possibility of life without husband Paul, who was on the plane, is sometimes overwhelming. She’s clinging to hope even though, as Weeks told CNN’s Piers Morgan, it’s “not looking good.”

“Every day, it just seems like it’s an eternity, it’s an absolute eternity,” Weeks said from Australia. “We can only go minute by minute … and hope something comes soon.”

WARSAW, March 10 (Reuters) - Poland's prime minister said on Monday he would ask Chancellor Angela Merkel to work to reduce German and European dependence on Russian gas to avert "potential aggressive steps by Russia in the future".

Merkel will visit Poland on Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia has effectively taken control of the southern Crimean peninsula. Events there have highlighted European reliance on Russian oil and gas.

Ukraine is a major gas transit nation for supplies from Russia to the European Union(EU), which relies on Russia for over a quarter of its gas.

"Germany's dependence on Russian gas may effectively decrease Europe's sovereignty. I have no doubts about that," Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference.

"Increasingly more expensive energy in Europe due to exorbitant climate and environmental ambitions may also mean greater dependence in Russian energy sources...Hence, I will talk (to Merkel) primarily about how Germany is able to correct some economic actions so that dependence on Russian gas doesn't paralyse Europewhen it needs...a decisive stance."

Germany has been one of the strongest proponents of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in Europe. Poland gets nearly all its energy from domestically produced coal and has opposed these efforts in the past.

"The question of Ukraine is a question of EU's future, EU's safety, and a correction of EU's energy policy," Tusk said.

Malaysia’s police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the flight simulator showed its data log had been cleared on Feb. 3. “The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,” he told the news conference. U.S. government sources said intelligence agencies had extensively analysed people on the flight but came up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives.

An unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way for the 12th day involving 26 nations in two vast search “corridors”: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia’s Sumatra island to west of Australia.

Investigators have also discounted reports the plane may have been sighted over the Maldives. Several residents of Kudahuvadhoo, one of the more remote atolls in the Indian Ocean island chain nation, had reported seeing a low-flying aircraft on the morning of March 8, when Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Malaysia’s Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a daily news conference on Wednesday that the reports had been investigated by police in the Maldives and were determined to be untrue.

No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.###1421||An anonymous billionaire in Silicon Valley recently purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy worth $201million.

SINGAPORE: Gold extended gains to a third session on Thursday, scaling fresh six-month highs as investors sought to hedge their bets against geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and economic slowdown fears in China.

Markets are eyeing more data from China due on Thursday to determine the state of the economy, after a recent bond default and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower.

Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14% so far this year on the global uncertainties.

Spot gold rose 0.4% to US$1,371.80 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after jumping 1.3% on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit US$1,374.45, its highest since Sept 19.

Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near US$1,355 an ounce.

"Given bullion's technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions," HSBC analysts said in a note.

"Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold."

US gold futures also rose on Thursday, hitting the highest mark since Sept 10.

Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at US$1,375-US$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards US$1,433.31, the Aug 28 high.

The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year.

However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday – the first decline since Feb 19.

Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China – the biggest bullion consumer – trading at a discount to spot prices. – Reuters

As of 12:45 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 32 points, or 0.2%, after repeatedly rising and falling in early trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was down 0.27% and the Nasdaq down 0.16% after following similar trajectories to the blue-chip index.

Within the Dow shares of McDonald's are up 3.3% to lead all winners higher, even after the release of a weak monthly sales figure yesterday. Click here to read my colleague Dan Caplinger's take on the fast-food juggernaut's stock movement today. As for the Dow losers, the telecom stocks are leading the index lower today. Shares of AT&T (NYSE:T) are down 1%, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has lost 1.3% of its value. Over the weekend AT&T announced it was reducing the price for its Mobile Share Value plan from $80 to $65 per month, with stipulations. The move is an attempt to combat the price cuts T-Mobile has been making to attract more customers to its network. Along with T-Mobile's aggressive pricing moves, AT&T and Verizon also must worry about a possible Sprint-T-Mobile merger. Masayoshi Son, chairman of Sprint parent company SoftBank, is making the rounds today to drum up support for the deal in Washington. Son has argued that the U.S. telecom industry needs change, and that the combined company would help boost America's mobile investments, speeds, and innovation. One problem with Son's argument is the U.S. mobile network is rather top-notch when compared to other nations.

Nonetheless, AT&T and Verizon shareholders should pay close attention to the potential Spring-T-Mobile merger, which would likely create an even more serious competitor to the lead telecoms.

Outside the Dow, shares of two retailers are heading in opposite directions. J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) was up more than 8% after the stock was upgraded from neutral to buy by Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen, who also boosted the price target to $11. Chen said believes investors' concerns about the company's credit problems are overblown, and if J.C. Penney's can hit its first-quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance, investors' fears will dissipate, giving way for the stock to move higher.

Shares of Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) were down 4.4% after the company reported quarterly earnings after the closing bell yesterday. The company posted revenue of $905.9 million and earnings per share of $0.59. Wall Street had expected revenue to hit $927.86 million and earnings per share of $0.55. Furthermore, management stated it remains very cautious about the current quarterly performance due to continued challenges.

Both J.C. Penney and Urban Outfitters certainly have their work cut out for them, and neither appears to be a sure investment win today.

An extended geographic presence, a wider product portfolio and a broader supply base are among the benefits from the merger of Chiquita Brands International and Fyffes, the produce giants said today (10 March).

The two companies this morning set out a deal to create ChiquitaFyffes, a business that will become the largest supplier of bananas worldwide.

Speaking to analysts on a conference call after the proposed merger was announced, Ed Lonergan, the Chiquita CEO set to be the chairman of the combined company, said the three factors were "critically important" to the new group.

"We don't tend to operate on top of one another with our brands. There's a de minimis overlap of the Fyffes brand and the Chiquita brand. The combination of Fyffes' geographies and Chiquita's geographies was truly compelling," Lonergan said.

Chiquita and Fyffes are, with Dole Food Co. and Fresh Del Monte Produce, four suppliers that account for 80% of the banana market. However, Lonergan said Chiquita and Fyffes did not expect to encounter concerns from market regulators, particularly in parts of Europe where both companies have notable positions.

"We don't think there are any issues we can't address in the regulatory process," Lonergan said.

The Chiquita boss, meanwhile, said the combined business, which would have annual sales of around US$4.6bn, would benefit from an expanded product range. "The opportunity to have brands, organic, Fairtrade, private label all from one company is quite compelling for our customer base," he said. The companies insisted they would keep both of their namesake brands.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who is set to be the new CEO of ChiquitaFyffes, told analysts the larger business would be better able to counter volatility in the banana market caused by external factors.

"Tog, our supply operations will benefit from the broadest geographical diversity in the industry, enabling the company to better meet customer and consumer needs for variety and better insulate the company from weather and other disruptions in any given area," he said.

The companies also see financial benefits from the transaction, including cost savings. They have set a target of "annualised pre-tax cost synergies" of US$40m by the end of 2016.

"We are very confident in the $40m of synergies we've identified, primarily in operations - growing, procuring and shipping our product. There are simple choices around the number of vessels we can run, comb the streams of product flow we have acr the oceans," Lonergan said. "We are also quite confident that as we continue to work together over the course of the coming years we'll find ways to operate more efficiently as we proceed."

The stock-for-stock transaction will see investors in US-based Chiquita own around 50.7% of what will be called ChiquitaFyffes. Shareholders in Ireland's Fyffes will own the other 49.3%.

Under the terms of the deal, Fyffes shareholders will receive 0.1567 ChiquitaFyffes shares for each share they hold in the Ireland-based firm. Chiquita investors will receive one ChiquitaFyffes share for each share they own in the US group.

The transaction values Fyffes at approximately US$526m and each Fyffes share at EUR1.22, which represents a premium of approximately 36% compared to the company's volume-weighted average trading price for the 30 trading days up until 7 March and a 38% premium to the Fyffes closing share price that day.

On that basis, the transaction will result in a combined equity value of approximately $1.07bn.###1430||Warning - there was an unexpected script error.

China’s environmental problems such as pollution and water scarcity are expected to intensify as rapid migration pushes urban infrastructures to the limit. Almost all Chinese cities monitored for pollution last year failed to meet the standards.

The environment has emerged as a key priority amid growing public disquiet about smog, dwindling and polluted water supplies and the contamination of farmland. Poor air quality is estimated to end hundreds of thousands of lives prematurely each year and has led to a series of riots and public protests.

The pledge to clean up the nation’s major metropolitan centres was made in a State Council plan for how to deal with China’s rapid urbanisation drive.

“We will improve and promote green, sustainable and low carbon development in the urbanisation process, enforcing the strictest measures on ecological and environmental systems,” the plan said.

According to the State Council, 60 percent of the cities will meet national air quality standards in 2020, which it said was up from 40 percent in 2012.

However, at China’s annual parliamentary session earlier this month, officials said only three of 74 major cities met the pollution standards in 2013.

The State Council plan outlined a lengthy list of policies it will implement to meet the target, including boosting renewable energy use, curbing emission-intensive industries and taking the most-polluting vehicles off the roads.

China will also set up a tiered pricing system for electricity, natural gas and water, to control rapid growth in consumption of scarce natural resources.

The government plans to roll out trading systems for carbon and air pollutant emissions, energy-saving certificates and water to provide economic incentives to reduce waste.

China has already picked seven key regions to launch pilot carbon trading schemes with the intention of setting up a national market to cut emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.

Guangdong province has already launched an emissions trading scheme, along with the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin.

FOOD SECURITY

China is also seeking to ensure it has enough labour in its vast farming sector to guarantee food security, with rural worker shortages one of the country’s biggest challenges.

The State Council plan restated China’s commitment to protect agricultural land from further urban and industrial encroachment, a policy known as its “red line.” It promised more state investment in major food-producing regions, improved insurance coverage in rural areas and reforms to the pricing systems of major agricultural commodities.

It also promised to raise farming mechanisation rates to around 70 percent from current levels of 60 percent.###1433||You are using an older browser version.

Importantly, this upward movement in transportation stocks is very positive for equity prices in general since a key element of Dow Theory suggests that transportation stocks usually lead the industrials to higher levels as economic activity improves.

Although overbought conditions are clearly present on all three indices at the moment, near-term corrections are always possible on each. Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.

That represents a potential 24% advance above current levels. It does not mean, however, that a move up to the 9,500 area is likely to emerge anytime soon, but it does represent an underlying optimism in equities that persists.

At this point in time, geopolitical and weather related issues continue to cloud future expectations for growth. That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.

Still, another facet of Dow Theory suggests that rising equity prices are usually accompanied by rising trading volumes which act as a confirmation to the prevailing bullish trend.

As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.###1436||You are using an older browser version.

Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.



Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.



A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox's request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.



The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets.



Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.



Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.



The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.



Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.





In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie. Copyright: Thomson Reuters 2014###1438||NEW YORK: King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game "Candy Crush Saga", expects to be worth up to US$7.6 billion when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online."Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf."I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate."I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida."The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.ANOTHER ZYNGA?"Candy Crush" launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.But most of that growth was fueled by "Candy Crush" rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of "Farmville" waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of "Angry Birds".Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in "Candy Crush" gross bookings.However, bookings rose for its other games such as "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga". About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ( http://r.reuters.com/bar57v )."The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."NYSE DEBUTKing's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.- Reuters###1439||Empty###1440||Empty###1441||Empty###1442||Oh no!

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MONTAGNE: An American company long synonymous with bananas is merging with an Irish rival to create the world's biggest banana company. The new company will be called ChiquitaFyffes, and it's expected to have annual sales of $4.6 billion.

A Chiquita executive tell The Wall Street Journal that ChiquitaFyffes will be able to offer customers, quote, "a more diverse product mix and choice."

Shoppers are pictured outside a Urban Outfitters store in Pasadena, California August 19, 2013. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni

Shares of the company, known for its Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters brands, fell 3 percent in extended trading.

The company’s overall same-store sales, which include online sales, rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter ended January 31.

However, comparable sales in the Urban Outfitters chain fell 9 percent as its merchandise failed to impress shoppers and severe winter weather dented traffic to its stores.

The brand contributed 43 percent to the company’s total sales in the quarter.

Urban Outfitters’ total sales rose 6 percent to $906 million, but came below the average analyst estimate of $925.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

“I believe that current quarter sales at the Urban (Outfitters) brand will remain well below those achieved in the first quarter last year and margins will likely be under considerable pressure,” Chief Executive Richard Hayne said on a conference call with analysts.

The company’s net income rose 7.4 percent to $88.7 million, or 59 cents per share, from $82.5 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected 54 cents per share.

Urban Outfitters’ shares were down at $36.75 in trading after the bell. The stock closed at $37.51 on the Nasdaq on Monday.###1446||The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into whether an ignition defect linked to 13 fatalities was ignored by General Motors for over a decade before it launched a massive recall last month.

On Tuesday, a congressional panel launched its own investigation. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D) of West Virginia has asked for a Senate investigation, as well.

The probe follows a North American recall of GM vehicles with faulty ignition switches including the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5, and Pontiac Pursuit in model years 2005-07 (sold only in Canada); the 2003-07 Saturn Ion; the 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice; and the 2007 Saturn Sky.

GM says the ignition defect could cause the engine and electrical systems of an affected vehicle to be switched off while the vehicle is in operation. A faulty ignition switch might be knocked out of the “run” position if the vehicle goes off-road or is jarred in some way, said GM, and could mean airbags won’t deploy in a crash.

GM has linked the defect to 31 accidents and 13 fatalities. The company also told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it investigated reports of problems with the ignition switches over the past 10 years but never fixed or replace the parts. It didn't launch the recall of the 1.6 million affected vehicles until last month, and it's that inaction that has sparked the investigations.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating GM’s handling of consumer complaints related to the ignition problems, as well as the response of the National Transportation Safety Administration, according to a statement released by the panel’s chairman, Rep. Fred Upton (R) of Michigan.

On Monday, GM released a timeline of what had happened.

“The chronology shows that the process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been,” said Alan Batey, GM’s North America president, in a statement. “Today’s GM is committed to doing business differently and better.

GM stock dropped by 5.15 percent Tuesday, closing at 35.18 per share. GM sales rose by 4 percent in 2013, when it sold more than 9.7 million vehicles worldwide and revenue increased by 2 percent to $155.4 billion, but the company’s 2013 profits of $3.8 billion fell short of the $4.9 billion profit GM reported in the previous year.

GM’s North America recall follows a separate recall launched by the company in China during December, which affected about 1.46 million vehicles built by a partnership of GM and Shanghai General Motors. In that recall, problems involved the vehicles’ fuel oil pump, according to the BBC.###1447||Empty###1448||×

Enlarge this image toggle caption Luis M. Alvarez/AP Luis M. Alvarez/AP

Ever since Republicans began using the words "repeal and replace" back in 2010 to describe their intentions for the Affordable Care Act, they've faced a question: What, exactly, would they replace it with?

While there's currently no clear Republican alternative for the health care law, President Obama's signature domestic achievement, the House Republican leadership is signaling there will be one this year.

The signal came in the form of an interview The Washington Post's Robert Costa had with House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-highest-ranking official in the House GOP's leadership.

The goal: give voters a clear way to distinguish the Republican and Democratic approaches as part of the GOP plan to bludgeon Democrats with the controversial health care law at every opportunity this midterm election year.

While there apparently isn't yet a detailed alternative to analyze, the concepts being considered as part of the proposed replacement are far from new. Indeed, they've been part of Republican alternatives from conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.

The final GOP package could include old standbys like health savings accounts, expanding state-run high-risk pools for the hardest-to-insure individuals, and the sale of insurance across state lines.

One immediate problem for Republicans is that these ideas don't exactly have buy-in from the insurance industry like, say, the individual mandate did, and without its backing, they would be hard to pull off.

Indeed, the insurance industry might be expected to fiercely lobby with its ample war chest against some, if not all, the GOP proposals.

"Every insurance industry executive I talk to thinks those proposals are silly," said Robert Laszewski, a health care industry expert, in an interview with It's All Politics. In a blog post, Laszewski explains industry officials' objections to GOP proposals, such as selling insurance across state lines.

Another problem for the Republican proposals is that they could undermine two of the health care law's most popular features — the ban against insurance companies declining to insure people with pre-existing conditions (or charging prohibitive amounts to do so) and the ability of parents to keep their children, up to age 26, on their insurance plans.

"Bingo," said Laszewski, when I raised this problem with him. When the ACA banned pre-existing conditions as a reason for not insuring someone, it obviated the need for the state-run high-risk pools, which is where people with pre-existing conditions formerly would turn.

A return to such high-risk pools would by definition mean revisiting a time when insurance companies used pre-existing conditions to exclude certain people.

"I can't imagine a Republican candidate wanting to go into a November election suggesting we go back on pre-existing conditions," Laszewski said.

Laszewski, no fan of how the Affordable Care Act was fashioned, is also skeptical of the Republican approach from what he's seen so far.

"I've been critical of the Obama people because they built Obamacare and they never really consulted people in the industry when they did it. That's one of the big reasons they got the mess that they do," Laszewski said. "And so here go the Republicans. Instead of doing something out of a left-wing think tank, the Republicans are doing it out of a right-wing think tank."###1450||Empty###1451||"For the associates who use the program day-in and day-out, or even week-in and week-out, they love it," said Jim Turner, a Humana spokesperson.

The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.

"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.

Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.

Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.

Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.

"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.

Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.

"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.

It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.

Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.

If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.



For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.

Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.

Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.

Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

AP

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.

Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.

Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.

"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.

Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.

"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.

"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.###1455||Empty###1456||Empty###1457||Empty###1458||The Bank of England will overhaul the way it works with banks and financial markets as it faces criticism of its response to signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



BoE Governor Mark Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.



"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told legislators.



A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up which will be spelled out in detail on March 18, he said.



"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.



The BoE said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor in July, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.



The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE's oversight of commercial banks.



The case for change at the Bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchanges rates.



Carney told the lawmakers that the BoE's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.



The BoE last week suspended an official amid an internal review into whether Bank staff failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark exchange rates, dating as far back as 2006.



Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the BoE first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the Bank's governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.



"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.



Carney said the BoE would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture at the Bank. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution," he said.



Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.



In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank officials and market players to discuss market issues.



It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

(Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd on Wednesday said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company's share price down by more than 15 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife's distribution model, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife, which has denied operating such a scheme, said it "will cooperate fully with the FTC."

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Herbalife's shared dropped 15 percent but recovered to be down 8.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday.

The commission declined comment on the probe.

Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

News of the FTC investigation followed one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Last week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", co-authored by three economists from the Bank's Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.

To get a sense of how radical the Bank's new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don't suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.

The central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.

It's this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say "there's just not enough money" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending "crowding out" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" … "In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money 'multiplied up' into more loans and deposits."

In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

What this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there's no question of public spending "crowding out" private investment. It's exactly the opposite.

Why did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it's obviously true. The Bank's job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It's possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.

But politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.

Historically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that's what's happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.###1467||UK supermarkets fall

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.

European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4 percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.

The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.

Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games

Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.



Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.

Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.

"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."

Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

But he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that "everybody is equal before the law".

"We will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials," Mr Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp legislature.

"China is a country that is under the rule of law," he continued.

"No matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law."

Reporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.

Neither Mr Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Mr Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.

If the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China's elite.

PSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.

News outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Mr Zhou at the press conference or "they would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

In his remarks on corruption, Mr Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.

"In the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people's cheese will be moved, so to speak," Mr Li said.

"For example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure."

Mr Li also addressed China's environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would "declare war" on pollution.

"To declare a war against smog doesn't mean that we are going to declare a war against nature," Mr Li said.

"Rather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life."

He added that "those overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable".

As China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours - particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's "unshakeable will" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another," he said.

"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises."###1469||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year—even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

April gold was last up $1.80 at $1,340.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $0.50 at $1,340.50. May Comex silver last traded down $0.107 at $20.79 an ounce.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.

WBAL's Steve Fermier talked with Andria Cheng of Marketwatch.com about the sale of Jos. A. Bank. Download This File

Looks like the corporate tug of war between Jos. A. Bank and Men's Wearhouse is over.

The rival company based out of state has apparently been successful in its attempt to acquire the Hampstead clothing company known for its 2 for 1 offers.

The price is reported to be $1.8 billion in cash.

The latest tender offer from Men's Wearhouse was approved unanimously by both boards.

Doug Ewert, President and Chief Executive Officer of Men's Wearhouse, will lead the combined company.

The deal will create the fourth largest men's clothing retailer in the country.

Men's Wearhouse fashions typically appeals to younger buyers while Jos. A. Bank is favored by older, more conservative and often more affluent customers.

And it's yet to be seen how the combined company will approach merchandizing, according to clothing retail analyst Andria Cheng with Marketwatch.com.

The Bank name will survive the merger, but, it's not clear how many stores will be closed in the process, Cheng said.

As for the Bank headquarters in Hampstead, Maryland, no clear decision on that is yet evident.

The combination will have 23,000 employees with 1,700 stores nationwide.

It's expected the Eddie Bauer purchase by Bank will likely be broken off.

One lawmaker who represents Carroll County in Annapolis calls news of the takeover a "sad occasion."

Republican State Senator Joe Getty told WBAL News that he is "worried that in a competitive industry, the company might close the (Jos. A. Bank) headquarters."

Getty says he has heard from some worried workers at the Hampstead facility, which employs 780 people. It is one of Carroll County's largest employers.

Republican Delegate Justin ready told WBAL News that, "from the corporate perspective it looks like a pretty good deal. They (Jos. A. Bank) got the asking price they wanted for their company."

Ready says he is concerned about the future of the Carroll County headquarters.

Neither Getty nor Ready say they have received any briefing from the company on the deal.###1475||(Reverts to author’s correct spelling of Hishammuddin)

By Stuart Grudgings

KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Reuters) - One of the world’s most perplexing aviation mysteries is casting a harsh spotlight on Malaysia’s government, as a leadership unused to heavy scrutiny comes under intense international criticism for a litany of confusing messages and a perceived lack of transparency.

Five days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared from civilian radar screens, a huge international search operation has failed to turn up a trace of the Boeing jetliner that was carrying 239 passengers and crew.

Frustration over the fruitless search has increasingly been directed at Malaysian officials after a series of fumbling news conferences, incorrect details given by the national airline, and a long delay in divulging details of the military’s tracking of what could have been the plane hundreds of miles off course.

The missteps have ranged from conflicting information about the last time of contact with the jet to the sharing of photos of two passengers in which they had the same pair of legs.

“The Malaysians deserve to be criticized - their handling of this has been atrocious,” said Ernest Bower, a Southeast Asia specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Government officials say they are coping as best they can with an exceptional, highly complex crisis.

Confusion, false leads, and misinformation are common in the initial hours of air disasters in any country.

But China, whose citizens made up around two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight, has barely hidden its impatience with Malaysia, urging it several times to step up the search and investigation efforts.

The head of the Civil Aviation Authority of China, Li Jiaxiang, told reporters on Thursday that the message had been repeated to Malaysia’s special envoy in the Chinese capital.

“Yesterday Malaysia’s special envoy arrived in Beijing, and the CAAC asked of him that Malaysia step up search efforts and increase their scope, and that we hope that Malaysia’s information release and communication can be smoother,” he said.

FAMILIES ANGRY

Some families of the up to 154 missing Chinese have voiced fury at what they said was the slow release of information. Verbal abuse and water bottles were hurled at representatives of the government-owned airline in Beijing.

“The core of Malaysia’s information hasn’t been consistent from start to finish,” said China’s widely read and influential Global Times tabloid, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily.

“It certainly hits at the confidence that the rest of the world has in Malaysia’s ability to be the nucleus of the rescue mission,” the paper added.

Other governments have praised the Malaysian effort, but some officials have complained of a lack of communication and information sharing that has slowed initial fact-finding.

U.S. officials said Malaysia’s failure to disclose the military’s radar tracking data until days after the plane’s disappearance meant important evidence may have disappeared.

“The lack of communication about what is going on is catastrophic,” said one Western regulatory source, asking not to be identified. “We are in the fourth dimension here.”

COMMUNICATION DEFICIT

Malaysia’s government, one of the longest-serving in the democratic world with the same coalition in power for the 57 years since independence, has struggled to cope with the harsh glare of international scrutiny.

The ruling United Malays National Organisation has long been criticised, including by some of its own members, for cronyism, an authoritarian streak and breeding a political culture in which loyalty is prized over talent.

Majority ethnic Malays have benefited from a system of economic and social privileges that has steadily alienated ethnic Chinese and Indians, who make up large minorities in the nation of 29 million people.

Just a day before the plane vanished, a court convicted opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim of sodomy and sentenced him to five years in prison, overturning his acquittal two years ago in a ruling that supporters and international human rights groups say was politically influenced.

Ministries often meet requests for information or interviews with silence.

“There was a lot of confusion on the first and second days of this incident,” a senior Malaysian defence official with knowledge of the operations told Reuters.

“A lot of permissioning, especially when you start sharing information with other ministries in government. I admit there is a lot of bureaucracy and we were slow.”

Malaysia’s response has been overseen personally by Prime Minister Najib Razak, who put his cousin - the defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein - in charge of day-to-day operations and interaction with the media.

“This is unique what we are going through,” Hishammuddin told reporters at a Wednesday news conference, batting away their complaints over a lack of transparency. “Coordinating with so many countries is not easy.”

The frequency of news conferences given to hundreds of reporters now massed at a hotel next to the international airport has dwindled sharply since the first day. The delayed briefing on Wednesday evening was the first to give details on the search operation in two days.

CONFUSION FROM START

The confusion began hours after the flight vanished from air traffic control radar early on Saturday morning. Malaysian Airlines initially said the plane lost contact at 2:40 a.m., two hours after its departure. Hours later, it corrected the time to 1:30 a.m.

As details emerged that some passengers had boarded the flight using stolen passports, Malaysia’s home minister was quoted by state news agency Bernama as saying that two men travelling on Italian and Austrian documents had “Asian faces”.

That was denied by Hishammuddin, and the muddle deepened when Malaysia’s aviation chief attempted a confusing analogy with the black Italian footballer Mario Balotelli.

The men turned out to be Iranians who were not suspected of being connected with the disappearance of the plane.

On Tuesday, police displayed pictures of the two in which their legs appeared exactly the same, sparking speculation of a cover-up. Police later said this was a photocopying error, according to local media.

National police chief Khalid Abu Bakar flatly denied a statement by the aviation chief that there were five passengers who checked-in for the flight and did not board. Malaysia Airlines later clarified there had been four passengers who did not show up at the airport for the flight.

Perhaps the greatest confusion was generated by the Malaysian military’s revelation on Sunday that the plane may have turned back from its scheduled path off Malaysia’s east coast before disappearing.

Officials did not give more details on the suspected “turnback” until Wednesday, leaving a gap that was filled by speculation the government was hiding something and doubts over whether the search was being conducted in the right place.

On Wednesday, officials confirmed they tracked an unidentified aircraft into the Malacca Strait, hundreds of miles and off the opposite coast from where the jet went missing.

Bowers, the Southeast Asia specialist, said Malaysia’s apparent mishandling of the situation could have long-term strategic consequences in a region where China’s economic and military might is growing rapidly.

“They have no maritime domain awareness and it doesn’t look like they have a strong command and control structure and they’re not well coordinated with friends. Sadly, that’s what the MH370 situation demonstrates,” he said of Malaysia.

“It’s not good and it fits in with the narrative I believe is forming in Beijing that China should and needs to take control.” (Additional reporting by Niluksi Koswanage, Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah and Yantoultra Ngui in Kuala Lumpur, Ben Blanchard in Beijing,; Tim Hepher in Paris,; Andrea Shalal-Esa and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Editing by Alex Richardson and Nick Macfie)###1476||Men’s Wearhouse turns tables and buys Jos.

March 11 (Reuters) - One of the top executives of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has raised questions about Comcast’s potential dominance of the U.S. broadband Internet market if regulators allow its $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable to be completed.

Speaking at an investor conference on Tuesday, Chase Carey, Fox president and chief operating officer, said the “broadband issue” will be front and center when U.S. regulators review the tie-up that merges the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators.

Asked about concerns over the merger, Carey said, “Probably the issue that will come out of it, and that will ultimately get focused on, is really the broadband issue. Is there choice in broadband? Are you really headed toward every home having simply one broadband provider, and what are the implications of that?”

If its bid for Time Warner Cable is approved, Comcast would be the Internet provider to about 40 percent of U.S. households paying for high-speed Internet access, analysts estimate.

As TV service becomes more personalized with new navigation tools and targeted advertising, broadband infrastructure, and who controls that service, will become even more critical, Carey said. There has not been any pushback so far from companies against the deal, he added.

“We haven’t seen any filings yet and how does that get addressed? I assume there will be aspects of that that are addressed,” he said.

“Potentially, you may have for most of the country, simply one wired broadband pipe and again that’s the piece that will get, at the end of the day, most focused on,” he said.

Comcast did not respond to a request for comment.

Also at the same conference, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes predicted a government role in bolstering post-merger competition.

“In the longer run there are some questions on competition that any deal like this will look at, the government will look at and make sure the appropriate conditions are in place to optimize competition,” Bewkes said.

DirecTV’s CEO Mike White, who was already called for regulatory scrutiny of the deal, said on Tuesday, that the government will likely focus on “all the aspects of Internet, from net neutrality to you name it.”

He also said the government should consider whether Comcast is a national business instead of a local one which “requires the government to take a different perspective.”

Once Comcast files its merger documents with regulators, the Justice Department and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission will both take months to review the merger’s impact on competition, focusing on antitrust and public interest concerns respectively.###1487||Stations near me All Stations###1488||In March, the Obama administration reported on Obamacare’s enrollment numbers. Fewer people have signed up than the administration had hoped, especially among the young and healthy. For many people, even the previously uninsured, the choices in the Obamacare market are simply not what they’re looking for in a health insurance plan.

It’s easy to understand why.

Obamacare replaces a wide variety of market-determined plans with a limited number of plans containing narrow networks of doctors and hospitals and a required set of items covered. No more cheap catastrophic care plan for the young man in his first job. Families and businesses can’t choose an insurance plan that meets their circumstances and needs. Now the government sets the plans and the networks.

The result is that cancer patients are losing access to the doctors and hospitals they rely on. Parents are losing their trusted pediatricians. And families may not have access to the hospital nearest to their homes.

Consider this: In Georgia, one of the five insurers offering plans on the Obamacare exchanges has just one hospital in the entire state in its network. In California and New York, major plans exclude the world-class Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and New York City’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering.

For those with serious and chronic illnesses, there is more terrible news. Many people are finding that their expensive, life-saving medications are not covered under their new Obamacare plans.

These narrow plans with narrow networks mean fewer choices, higher costs, and difficult decisions for millions of Americans.

Some families do pay less for their monthly premiums for Obamacare-subsidized plans. Many more working families, who earn too much to qualify for subsidized plans, are paying considerably more each month for their health insurance. But the monthly premium is not the only cost in a health insurance plan.

Families are finding that their insurance won’t begin paying for care until they’ve spent $5,000, $10,000, or more of their own money toward the deductible first. And once the deductible is met, the co-insurance (the amount the plan pays) may be as low as 60 percent, leaving individuals to pay the rest of the bill for their care by themselves.

Most plans in the previous insurance market had an “out-of-pocket” cap to prevent people from losing everything in the event of a serious health problem. But in the Obamacare exchanges, some plans are offered with out-of-pocket protection only for care provided in-network. If you go to a doctor or hospital outside of your network, your insurance plan may pay nothing.

People who rely on an expensive medication—for multiple sclerosis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, or HIV for example—are seeing their medication costs skyrocket. If the medication is covered by their insurance plan, they may still have to pay 40 percent of the cost, or thousands of dollars a year, up to the out-of-pocket limit. If the medication is not covered, they must pay the full price and the cost does not count toward the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Their expenses then are literally limitless.

One of the most serious problems with Obamacare is that it mistakes health insurance for health care. Obamacare supporters pretend that if every person has a health insurance plan, then they are getting the health care they need. That is simply not true. As we have seen, a plan that doesn’t include your doctor or your medication doesn’t provide the care you need. But there is another serious problem quickly coming into view.

For decades, poor people in this country have been eligible for Medicaid. The amount the government pays doctors to see Medicaid patients, however, is very low. At some point, when a doctor is not getting paid enough to cover the basic expenses of providing care, he or she will stop accepting Medicaid patients, or get out of medicine altogether. That is why today Medicaid patients can wait months for care, if they can find a doctor who will see them at all.

Obamacare specifically expands Medicaid to a wider segment of the population. Young adults with low incomes and the children of low-income families may have Medicaid as their only choice in the Obamacare exchanges, based on family income. So far, enrollment in Medicaid has been more than half of the signups made under the new Obamacare rules. Who will provide care to those people? How long will they have to wait to see a doctor?

In 2008, about 15 percent of Americans were uninsured. The Congressional Budget office projects that under Obamacare, in the years 2013-2023, the percentage of uninsured will never fall below 11 percent of the population. That’s not much of a change in health insurance rates, at the expense of more expensive, less accessible health care for millions more Americans.

The leaders of the Senate Banking Committee have reached a bipartisan agreement on how to overhaul the housing finance market — now they face the challenge of building a broad base of support to establish their legislation as the leading proposal for getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

What to do with the two mortgage finance giants has bedeviled policymakers since the government took over the companies in September 2008 as the housing market cratered and the financial crisis neared its zenith.

Story Continued Below

The plan announced on Tuesday by Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and the panel’s top Republican, Mike Crapo of Idaho, represents a centrist approach in which the government will still play a role in supporting the mortgage market but less of one than it does today.

( Also on POLITICO: Fannie, Freddie to repay taxpayers)

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long term, and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy,” Johnson said in a joint statement with Crapo. “This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs.”

The bill is unlikely to receive a floor vote this year. But if the Banking Committee approves a plan, it could set the stage in the next Congress for the first serious negotiations since taxpayers rescued Fannie and Freddie.

The White House has hitched itself to the committee’s plan with administration officials working with Johnson and Crapo throughout their negotiations.

“While maintaining their principles, both sides made difficult concessions in order to move this debate forward,” White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne said in a statement. “We support this effort and believe it is a workable bipartisan approach to complete the biggest remaining piece of post-recession financial reform.”

The Johnson-Crapo proposal expands on a plan introduced last year by Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) that would wind down Fannie and Freddie and replace them with a new agency, known as the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corp., that is modeled after the the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Like the Corker-Warner plan, the new agency would guarantee certain mortgages after the first 10 percent of losses on new loans are covered by private capital, according to an outline of the bill.

( Also on POLITICO: Donovan upbeat on housing reform)

Johnson and Crapo plan to introduce legislative text in the coming days and have the committee vote on the proposal in a few weeks.

The immediate challenge facing the two senators is to build support beyond the 10 committee members who endorsed the Corker-Warner bill — five Democrats and five Republicans. To attract liberal Democrats, the affordable housing aspects of the proposal have to be robust, while many Republicans are wary of keeping a large role for the government in the housing market.

On Tuesday, several panel members said they wanted to review specifics of the proposal before giving it a thumbs up or thumbs down.

“I don’t have a reaction yet,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said in an interview. “I will always have concerns about affordable housing.”

Corker commended Johnson and Crapo for putting together a plan but held back on endorsing their proposal.

Some committee members were enthusiastic.

“Amen, brother,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said in an interview. “Let’s get it done — have a markup and kick it out of committee before Easter.”

Johnson will retire at the end of this Congress, making the level of support he and Crapo can build this year all the more important to their proposal’s eventual success. Brown’s support is likely key because he could be the committee’s next chairman.

House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has introduced a competing approach that would greatly reduce the government’s support of the mortgage market, essentially leaving only a scaled-down Federal Housing Administration as a backstop for home loans.###1492||By Agencies

An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth $201 million.



The man who cobbled the deal together said Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.



"No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a "well-known billionaire”.



The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday.



Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.



"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.



Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.



Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.



Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.



"He wants his next of kin to keep working hard," Frances said.



Frances said that the annual premium is in "the low, single digits of millions of dollars."



He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.



Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age.



Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder. Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other startups, declined to discuss with the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.

Do you remember where you were on March 6, 2009?

It was five years ago today that the S&P 500 (SPX) recorded its intraday bottom for the financial crisis of just under 667. It was the lowest point for U.S. stocks in over a decade.

Fast forward to today and the benchmark is notching a fresh record nominal high of 1,882, nearly tripling from the 2009 low.

The current bull market is sixth on the all-time list in terms of duration, according to Bespoke Investment Group. When looking at total percentage gains, this bull ranks fourth.

Of course, the big question for investors is what's next after such a big rally. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher made headlines this week when he warned the Fed should make sure “the ghost of 'irrational exuberance' does not haunt us again.”

Some are worried that valuations are stretched and that central-bank stimulus has fueled a bubble. Then again, investors have been hearing those concerns for years, and yet the market continues to grind higher.

Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, notes that since the end of World War II, there have been 11 bull markets. Fewer than 30% of these bull markets have celebrated a sixth birthday. However, bull markets that have survived a sixth year have averaged gains of 26% that year, according to Stovall.

"As always, use history as a guide, not gospel, especially since there has been a limited number of sixth-year bulls," he adds.

The petrol car that has a V8 engine is priced at ₹1.36 crore (ex-showroom, Mumbai) against ₹1.57 crore for the completely built unit (CBU) version.

The package includes a 21-module, multi-lingual chauffeur training programme for the drivers.

The car has a three-month waiting period and bookings will now open for June 14 delivery, the company said.

“We have seen unprecedented demand for it, and the initial allocation of 125 units was sold out in 16 days,” said Eberhard Kern, MD and CEO, adding this was the reason why the local assembly has started nearly two months earlier than the initial plan.

The locally built S-500 is a five-seater, while the CBU one launched in early January was a four-seater. It has 35-40 per cent local content, including the body work, engines, axles and transmission, and this, in addition to the reduced duty announced by the Government, accounts for the lower price tag.

Pointing out that the new S-Class has several sophisticated technological features and innovations, Kern said drivers needed to be trained on aspects like driving at night or in heavy rain, on braking, and utilisation of safety equipment.

At the Chakan plant, Mercedes Benz currently builds the E, C, S, ML and GL series of cars.###1502||The first Federal Open Market Committee meeting to be presided by new Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen will focus on how to reword its present low rate promise with enough gravitas so as not to upset financial markets in the process.

It is expected that the Fed will come up with a decision next week whether to remove its existing benchmark of a 6.5 percent U.S. jobless rate as the threshold upon which it should raise interest rates, and change the wording of its promise that does not rely on statistics as a guide for when the ultra-easy money policy may be shifted. This threshold has been a hallmark feature of the Fed’s forward guidance since the end of calendar 2012, when the pledge was made in order to highlight the importance of its economic stimulus initiative.

However, the U.S. unemployment rate has been teetering ever so close to the 6.5 percent threshold as of late, and even as it increased to 6.7 percent last month, jobless statistics have been trending downwards since the start of stimulus. Be that as it may, Fed policymakers are being monitored closely, as they prepare for a shift in guidance that may hint at higher rates going forward.

“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6.5 percent threshold because it’s not really providing any great value,” said New York Federal Reserve President William C. Dudley in an interview last week. “I’d rather do it before we reach the threshold rather than after.” Despite the eagerness of Dudley and other high-ranking central bank officials, experts believe that it would behoove Yellen to change the promise’s wording in such a way that it does not change local and international market expectations, as these markets are not expecting a rise in interest rates until the middle part of calendar 2015.

For its part, the Fed had previously asserted that it will not consider increasing interest rates even if the unemployment rate falls below the threshold, contingent on inflation remaining at healthy levels.

Given the softness of recent economic statistics, most Fed officials have pinned the blame on extraordinarily poor weather conditions in the winter months, and are henceforth planning to continue tapering stimulus by another $10 billion per month, reducing the central bank’s bond purchases to $55 billion per month. This would leave the rewording of the low rate promise and a possible change in forward guidance as the main talking points of the next FOMC meeting, which takes place on March 18 and 19. The Fed will issue a policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT on the 19th, and Yellen will hold her first press conference as U.S. central bank Chairwoman 30 minutes thereafter.

Aside from Yellen’s news conference and the Fed’s official statement, the central bank will also update its forecasts for economic growth, and other key financial statistics such as unemployment and inflation. In the light of that, the Fed will also be adjusting its forecasts for when it would raise interest rates from their near-zero level.###1503||Empty###1504||Drawing on the experience of previous government health programs, the administration and many outside experts had long predicted a rush to sign up for coverage during the final few weeks.

The Labor Department said that the U.S. economy added 175,000 new jobs last month. That surprised economists, who had expected just 149,000 new jobs in February. An improving U.S. job market makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will slow the tapering of its monthly stimulus.

Last week, I wrote about some of the ways Obamacare impacts small businesses, specifically five requirements Obamacare places on small businesses and five opportunities Obamacare affords small businesses. As discussed, while small businesses (i.e. companies with fewer than 50 employees) are exempt from many of the most rigorous requirements of the Affordable Care Act -- most notably, the Employer Mandate -- there are still some requirements and even some opportunities that small business owners should be aware of regarding Obamacare.

As an Obamacare attorney, I have observed that the factors a small business has to consider with respect to the Affordable Care Act can change quite dramatically if its workforce grows beyond 50 full-time employees. This can occur over time as a result of the natural growth of the business but can also happen rapidly and unexpectedly as a result of a business transaction.

Here are three tips that any small business owner considering a business transaction should keep in mind to ensure that there are no unexpected Obamacare surprises as a result of the transaction:

1. Count Hours, Not Just Employees

To determine how many full-time employees a business has for purposes of the Affordable Care Act, a business has to count not only its actual full-time employees (those work more than 30 hours per week) but also the number of hours worked by its part-time employees. The number of hours worked by part-time employees is aggregated to calculate a company's full-time equivalents. Therefore, as part of the due diligence process, the acquiring company should focus not only on the target company's full-time employees but also its full-time equivalents. If the target company's and acquiring company's full-time employees and full-time equivalents combine to total more than 50 employees, the new combined company will be subject to the Employer Mandate and other requirements of Obamacare.

2. Remember Controlled Groups

While the process above might seem obvious in the context of two related businesses that combine (i.e. a gardening business buys its competitor down the street to form a larger gardening business), it is less intuitive but still applicable in the context of unrelated businesses under common ownership.

The Affordable Care Act assesses liability with respect to the Employer Mandate on what the Tax Code calls a "controlled group" basis. Essentially, what this this means is that companies that are otherwise totally separate businesses are treated as one company for certain purposes if they are owned by the same or similar people (or corporations).

Therefore, when purchasing a business in an M&A transaction, the acquirer needs to consider the workforce not only of the business it is acquiring but also of other seemingly unrelated businesses it may own.

3. Beware of Successor Liability

Until now, we have been thinking about acquisitions of small businesses that prior to acquisition were exempt from the Employer Mandate. But what if the target business had more than 50 employees and was therefore subject to all of Obamacare?

While there is still some ambiguity that is awaiting further guidance from the IRS, the possibility of successor liability is important to keep in mind. This would mean that the purchaser could be on the hook for any liabilities of the previous owners if they failed to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, it is important to ask about and seek evidence of the company's compliance with the applicable provisions of Obamacare or the new owner could be left holding the bag for the previous owner's actions. Additionally, a purchaser should consider the possibility of post-closing liability in any transaction, and ensure that the transaction document contains the appropriate representations and allocates responsibility for any Affordable Care Act penalties accordingly.###1508||Empty###1509||Empty###1510||LOS ANGELES (AP) � Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time since the suburbs began booming.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise � the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released today by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored after economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."

Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained 9 million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for 1 in 3 trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."###1511||Last week, supportive factors for gold came into prominence. Yet, it failed to find upward traction. This should worry those bullish on the yellow metal.

Even the heady combination of geopolitical development in the form of Russia-Ukraine conflict and a substantially weaker dollar could not boost gold prices. On Friday, the London PM Fix was at $1,335 an ounce, down 0.7 per cent from the previous day’s $1,345/oz.

Investor interest played a supportive role, though. Tactical investors have increased their exposure in Comex gold with net fund length hitting a new high, the highest since April 2013. Speculative positioning has risen with short-covering and establishment of fresh longs. But investor interest flows from concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict; and therefore risks being less-committed or temporary.

Movements in physically-backed gold ETP holdings are seen as stabilising. As of Friday last, total holdings were an estimated 1,860 tonnes, down 18 tonnes since the beginning of the year. Prices will find support on the downside if hefty outflows do not materialise.

However, the forex market prospect is seen as bearish for gold. Friday’s US labour market report was more optimistic for those bullish on the greenback . Currency experts expect the dollar to rule firm, going forward which in turn can put pressure on gold. Additionally, global equities have performed well despite the ongoing geopolitical situation involving Russia.

From a fundamental perspective, Indian demand has been lacklustre with import controls continuing. Local prices have stayed around ₹30,000 for 10 grams. There is considerable pressure on the Finance Ministry to ease the import regulations and cut the customs duty (10 per cent), exacerbated by reports of smuggling. On the other hand, demand in China is stable to strong, going by steady volumes traded on Shanghai Gold Exchange.

The February US employment report released on Friday suggests a return to modest jobs growth. This by itself has eroded the safe-haven premium that gold enjoyed for a few days last week. It is widely believed that the Fed will stay on its taper path. Fed meeting slated for later this month is keenly awaited; but consensus suggests there could be a further $10 billion reduction in its asset purchase programme.

With the macro environment and fundamentals looking neutral and forex market looking bearish for gold, the metal looks vulnerable to correction in the coming days, triggered by anticipated easing of geopolitical tensions.

Gold’s recent rally looks petering out, with investor fatigue set to return. The normalisation of the US monetary policy poses a big risk to gold prices as liquidity will shrink and an important driver — excess liquidity — will be available no more. So, Q2 — April-June — may see a much weaker gold price testing $1,200/oz.

Whether the benefit of fall in gold’s dollar rates will available to Indian consumers will depend on the value of rupee vis-à-vis the dollar.###1512||Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has hinted that RBS would be forced to move its headquarters across the border if Scotland votes for independence this September.

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie pressed Mr Carney for a more specific answer, calling his response "a central bank phrase with a sort of layer of lawyer on top." However the Governor declined to add anything.###1513||Copyright 2018 Zacks Investment Research

Nasa is looking at how it can contribute to the search by making use of its valuable space assets to search images of Earth from space.

"Activities under way include mining data archives of satellite data acquired earlier and using space-based assets, such as the Earth-Observing-1(EO-1) satellite and the ISERV camera on the International Space Station, to acquire new images of possible crash sites," NASA spokesman Allard Beutel told Space.com.

"The resolution of images from these instruments could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 metres) or larger."

Nasa is also going to send any data it finds that could be relevant to the missing airplane over to the US Geological Survey's Earth Resources Observations and Science Hazard Data Distribution System. The agencies collate and share information whenever the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters is activated.

The charter was activated on Tuesday following a request by China's Meteorological Administration.

"Both naval vessels and aircraft from at least ten different countries are participating in the search. Satellite imagery is now being employed to search for any evidence of the plane, both before and after it disappeared," says the official charter activation notice.

"No distress signals have been received from the plane and it remains unknown what happened. It has been noted by investigators that it is very unusual for an airliner to simply disappear in such a manner."

According to the latest reports, the engine data sent out from Flight MH370 via the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) before it disappeared reveals that the jet might have continued to fly for an additional five hours after it lost contact with air traffic controllers.

If it had flown for that long, it would likely have travelled over 2,000 nautical miles and deviated from its scheduled flight path.

Relatives of the passengers and crew onboard the ill-fated plane have fuelled speculation by reporting that mobile phones belonging to passengers continued to ring long after the plane was declared missing last Saturday.

However, the phone industry says that the "Phantom Phone" theory was nonsense and that the phone operator generates a ringing sound so that callers don't give up on making a call when they hear no ring tone.###1516||(CNN) – U.S. Navy SEALs have taken control of a commercial tanker that had been seized by three armed Libyans earlier this month.

No one was hurt in the Sunday night operation, the Pentagon said.

The tanker, Morning Glory, is carrying oil owned by Libya’s National Oil Company.

It sailed last week from the rebel-held port of As-Sidra in the nation’s east. Libyan forces fired on the vessel but were called off by the U.S. Navy, fearing an environmental disaster.

The situation remains unsettled in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

In this case, the issue centers around the oil-rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular, Ibrahim Jadran. The militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports. But last July, Jadran and his men seized them, blocking oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region.

He said he acted because the government is corrupt.

The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please.

Currently, very few pure electric cars are available in the market and the Tesla Model S is the only competitor in the luxury sedan segment.

According Dr. Uwe Ernstberger, the chief of Mercedes' large car division, the all-electric S-Class isn’t currently highest priority, but they will get to it over time. Speaking to TopGear magazine at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, Dr Uwe said, "We have to work on the capacities of the batteries to get a better package in the car, because you do not want to lose all the comfort features of an S-Class for transporting a battery only. First of all we'll have the plug-in hybrid, where you can drive between 25km to 30km on electric power. We want to use a battery to support electric driving in a closed city like London, and we use the combustion engine for driving outside the city."

Mercedes-Benz has a stake in the American electric car maker, Tesla Motors, and plans to collaborate with it to develop the technology. The German manufacturer has been involved with electric cars with the Smart brand, the practical B-Class Electric Drive as well as the brilliant 740bhp SLS AMG Electric Drive. The problems with pure electric cars are their driving range and battery packs. With their products, Mercedes-Benz has shown that they can make sensible as well as outrageously fast electric cars, but the company probably wants to wait for technology to mature before trying it on their flagship sedan.###1520||WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission will investigate the controversial vitamin company Herbalife, the company disclosed Wednesday, an action that Senator Edward J. Markey had urged in a letter to the FTC in January.

Markey was the only member of the Senate who said yes to entreaties by hedge fund executive William A. Ackman to seek an investigation of the company, which were relayed to the senator through his staff.

Ackman, who has a $1 billion bet against Herbalife and lobbied Markey and other members of Congress to take action against the company, has said most lawmakers rebuffed him because they knew he would reap a windfall if the company’s stock declined significantly.

Markey told the Globe this week that he had no idea Ackman and his hedge fund company could reap a sizeable profit from his actions. Markey’s office said he sought the probe of Herbalife because his own staff’s research had made him concerned with Herbalife’s business practices. He agreed with the hedge fund manager’s complaints that Herbalife may have victimized its sales force.

The New York Times has reported on Ackman’s effort to push federal regulators and lawmakers to take action against Herbalife.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Markey’s fellow Massachusetts Democrat, was among those who refrained from seeking an investigation of the supplement marketing company. Warren, a newcomer to Congress, seemed to have taken a more cautious approach than Markey, whose House tenure began in 1976.

“What mattered to me is that I hadn’t yet seen all the details, and the facts are moving quickly,” Warren, who is known for her consumer activism in the financial world, said Wednesday.

Ackman has what is known as a “short” position in Herbalife’s stock, meaning his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, will profit handsomely if the stock plummets. For more than a year, Ackman has been in a high-stakes battle with Herbalife, trying to persuade the public and key decision-makers that the company is a pyramid scheme that preys on its sales force. Herbalife, which sells nutritional supplements, has employed its own team of lobbyists. It denies the charges.

In a statement, the company said it welcomes the FTC inquiry, “given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully.”

In late January, Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, requesting an investigation of Herbalife, which caused the stock to drop 14 percent. Wednesday, Herbalife stock dropped more than 7 percent after the company disclosed that it was the subject of a civil investigation from the FTC.

In three detailed letters to the FTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Herbalife, Markey conveyed the stories of two unnamed Massachusetts residents, including a family in Norton who reported losing $130,000 and their entire 401(k) after investing in the company. Markey’s office would not provide the names of the people in the letters, saying they requested confidentiality.

He also asked numerous questions related to allegations that the company is a pyramid scheme.

“I take no position on the merits of these allegations,” he wrote to the FTC. “However, out of concern that Herbalife’s business practices may be having a negative impact on my constituents in Massachusetts, I request that you investigate the company’s business practices yourself to confirm that the company is acting in accordance with the consumer protection laws.”

Another New England senator, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday that he had also been contacted by Ackman. But Blumenthal, the state’s former attorney general, stopped short of seeking an inquiry. Spokesman Josh Zembik said Blumenthal spoke with FTC chair Edith Ramirez in December and discussed Herbalife’s business practices.

‘The letters I sent . . . are consistent with my approach to my oversight responsibilities.’ Sen. Edward Markey

“But he did not advocate or ask for an investigation,” Zembik said, adding that Blumenthal was satisfied that Ramirez already understood the facts and possible merits of the allegations against the company.

Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said he did not believe his office had been contacted, but sounded surprised that any lawmaker would have been asked to get involved.

“Somebody shorting a company? No.” Corker said Wednesday. “It’s not an issue of Senate concern, is it?”

Ackman contributed $32,400 to the general campaign fund of Senate Democrats but not directly to Markey. Ackman also retained Rasky Baerlein, a Boston-based communications and lobbying firm with close ties to Markey, to work with community groups and elected officials at the state and local level in Massachusetts. Both Markey and Larry Rasky, a former Markey staff member, said Rasky and his firm did not discuss the issue with Markey.

Markey’s staff was aware that a probe of Herbalife would have potential financial benefits to Ackman, but that information was not relayed to Markey, the senator said.

Markey’s spokeswoman, Giselle Barry, said Markey’s staff conducted its own research into the merits of the claims against Herbalife’s business practices, and the impact on consumers, and that Markey’s decision to send the letters would not have changed, even if he had known Ackman stood to make a profit.

She said Markey would not investigate why his staff failed to fully inform him of Ackman’s motives, nor would anyone in his office face discipline. She would not say exactly what Markey was told, which staff members provided the information, or whether Markey did any research on his own before signing the letters.

In a statement to the Globe, Markey emphasized his decades-long commitment to consumer issues, including fights over toxic chemicals in baby bottles and the safety of General Motors vehicles that were the recent subject of recalls.

“The letters I sent earlier this year are consistent with my approach to my oversight responsibilities,” he said. “Safeguarding people in Massachusetts and on Main streets across our country has always been my focus.”

Why Markey would not have been informed of such a crucial element of Ackman’s request — his profit motive — has not been explained. What is clear is that Markey’s letter to the FTC had a big effect.

“The Markey letters had more of an impact on the Herbalife stock price probably than anything in the last year,” said Scott Van Winkle, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity who follows Herbalife.

Ackman’s financial interest in driving down Herbalife stock had been the subject of attention in the financial media for more than a year, often characterized as a battle of egos between Ackman and Carl Icahn, the billionaire who became the company’s largest investor. (Ackman said he will donate any profits he makes personally, though he acknowledges his firm would benefit.)

“My God, I’m surprised it hasn’t been on ‘Saturday Night Live,’ it’s been out there so much,” said Gabriel E. Gomez, the former private equity manager who lost last year’s special election to Markey. “You can’t just go out there and talk speculatively about a public company unless you’ve done your homework.”

In the days before Markey’s letters to regulators targeting the company became public, there was a spike in purchases of so-called “put” options of Herbalife stock. Those options, which were the subject of a New York Times report in January, are essentially bets against the company’s stock.

Though Ackman acknowledged his lobbyists were working with Markey before the January letters to regulators went out, he said on Monday he did not get early notice that Markey was sending letters out to regulators. But the New York Times has previously reported that copies of Markey’s letters to regulators were posted on the website of Ackman’s company, Pershing, originally dated January 22, while Markey’s office sent out copies with a January 23 date. Ackman said on a conference call Tuesday that his company obtained his copies of the letters on Markey’s website, which at one point posted earlier versions of the letters.

Though several investors in Herbalife said privately this week that they are furious at Markey, they have declined to speak publicly, for fear of antagonizing him. It could become a political liability, though Markey, who is up for reelection this year, has not drawn significant opposition.

“Senator Ed Markey’s back-room deal-making to benefit his friends is what is wrong with Washington, D.C.,” the state GOP said in a statement. “After 35 years in Washington putting politics over people, Markey appears more concerned with lining the pockets of his donors than serving the people he works for.”

Markey has maintained that he wrote the letters as a consumer advocate. And many consumer advocates in Massachusetts, though unfamiliar with the specifics of the Herbalife imbroglio, back him up.

“Ed Markey has been a consumer advocate for the last 40 years, since he’s been in Congress, and that he has sound footing in,” said Deirdre Cummings, director of the consumer program for MassPIRG, a state group active on a number of consumer fronts. “Out of the handful of people in Congress that you can count on, people who represent the consumer side, it would be Ed Markey.”

The move by the Federal Trade Commission, a government agency, follows relentless attacks by Bill Ackman, the head of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, against the company.

Mr Ackman has claimed Herbalife makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers. The company has, however, denied this and the implication it is operating as a “pyramid scheme”.

Shortly after Mr Ackman, who holds a $1bn short position in Herbalife, made the accusation in 2012, hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb called his rival’s claims “preposterous” and took an 8.6pc stake in the company. Mr Loeb’s purchase, coupled with a similar move by activist investor Carl Icahn, sent the shares higher, hitting the finances of Mr Ackman.###1522||Racked is no longer publishing.

The Internet is abuzz with the news today that that Amazon will increase its annual fee for Amazon Prime by 25%, from $79 to $99. Starting April 17, customers will have to decide how much they're willing to pay for the unlimited two-day delivery service. Many are moaning about the price hike—and startup delivery services are jumping at this window of opportunity to grab disgruntled Amazon subscribers.

The folks at SF-based ShopRunner, for example, are offering free two-day deliveries for a year (it's typically $79 annually) to Amazon Prime members who haven't renewed their subscription. Shoprunner has set up a dedicated page on its site detailing the offer. And we're guessing same-day delivery services like Google Shopping Express, Walmart, and Six Doors are scheming their own ways to lure customers from their biggest competitor. Will you renew your Amazon Prime at the new price, or will you be shopping around come next month?

Investors latched on to Yahoo on Monday in anticipation of a huge windfall from Alibaba's initial public offering of stock later this year. Yahoo's stock gained $US1.51, or four per cent, to close at $US39.11.

Alibaba ignited the excitement about its forthcoming IPO by announcing plans to list its stock on a US exchange.

Yahoo Inc is expected to sell about half its 24 per cent stake in Alibaba as part of an IPO that analysts believe could raise $US15 billion ($A16.78 billion). That means Yahoo is likely to collect several billion dollars from AIibaba's IPO. That money could then be used to pay a special dividend to shareholders or buy back more of its stock.###1525||###1526||Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its U.S. joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.###1527||Empty###1528||Empty###1529||Of course some rules and regulations are necessary in a free market economy. Fraud is illegal. Pollutants are regulated. The question is how more rules and regulations imposed by the government improve the efficiency and effectiveness of industry and lower costs for consumers. The 2007 housing market collapse and recession were seeded by government intervention in the mortgage industry. The Community Reinvestment Act �encouraged� banks to make risky loans while assuring the backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They then lowered interest rates amping up the market. Yes Wall Street took advantage of the situation but they did not cause it. Corporations make good business decisions by leaving off-shore profits, off-shore. The U.S corporate tax is 35%, the highest in the industrialized world. If repatriated, stockholders effectively pay these taxes. They are again taxed if distributed as dividends. Businesses also make good decisions by seeking low cost sites. It benefits the consumer and let�s manufacturers compete in the global market. These are prudent business decisions not a lack of integrity. Finally, it�s understood that premiums are mostly determined by claims experience. However, mandatory coverages dictated by government do impact costs. Costs will also increase, directly and indirectly, due to more than 20 new and increased taxes imbedded in Obamacare.

Joe Weisenthal and Matthew Bosler at Business insider have been pushing the debate forward, see here and here, for example. This is an important concern for monetary policy as the general consensus on the Fed is sufficient slack will continue to justify an extended period of low interest rates. Hence, rate hikes can be delayed until mid- to late-2015, or even 2016 as suggested by Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans. There exists, however, considerable uncertainty about the amount of slack in labor markets. My feeling is that path of rates currently expected by policymakers assumes a great deal of slack. As a consequence, indications that slack is less than expected will tend to move forward the timing of the first rate hike and, perhaps the pace of subsequent tightening. Wage pressures are likely to be an early indicator that slack is diminishing.

I see two flavors of uncertainty regarding the amount of excessive slack. First is the question about the value of the unemployment rate as a signal of tightness. The decline in the labor force participation rate has clearly placed additional downward pressure on the unemployment, leading to speculation that the unemployment rate is signaling a tighter labor market than exists in reality. Under this scenario, an improving economy will trigger a flood of entrants into the labor force to provide additional slack. Thus, the unemployment rate is underestimating the degree of slack.

This argument, however, is becoming less persuasive by the day. Evidence seems to be mounting (seehere and here) that retirement and illness/disability are a dominant reason for labor force exits since the recession began. Consequently, the decline in the labor force participation will be a persistent phenomenon. The Fed, I think, has largely moved in this direction.

The next issue is the degree of underemployment with the labor market. The dovish view is that the underemployed and long-term unemployed represent considerable slack:

The hawkish view is that this is not a cyclical problem but a structural one. The long-term unemployed, by this theory, simply lack the currently needed skills. This is countered by indications of discrimination against the long-term unemployed. Such discrimination effectively means that you need to have a job to get a job. The ability of firms to engage in such discrimination could be viewed as a cyclical problem. Firms could not be so choosy in a stronger labor market.

Regarding underemployment, I see evidence of the structural explanation in a comparison in the reasons for part time employment:



Those employed part time for clearly cyclical reasons are falling. Those employed part time because they could not find full time work is holding steady. It may be that the skill set of those workers is not consistent with the current types of full time jobs.

Doves will point to the lackluster data of the Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) report to support the claim of weak labor markets with plenty of slack. The numbers are certainly not impressive:

That said, the counterpoint is the number of unemployed to job openings:

My view is that wage growth will ultimately settle the debate. Wage acceleration tends to occur as unemployment approaches 6%. If that wage acceleration does not occur, then the degree of labor market slack remains is high. The much longer and established data on hourly wages for production and nonsupervisory workers, however, appears to indicate some bubbling wage pressures:



My belief is that if this is happening for lower paid workers, it is only a matter of time before it happens for higher paid workers as well. That said, I am open to the possibility that the limited improvement we are seeing may not persist. It is, however, an issue that I think is of critical importance.

How will – versus how should – indications of tighter labor markets influence Fed policy? As I have said in the past, the Fed typically tightens policy ahead of inflationary pressures. In practice, that has meant hiking rates around the time wage growth bottoms out:

Is this time any different? Well, let’s replace “tightens” policy above with “reduces accommodation” since the Fed would not claim that a 25bp increase in rates from 1% was tightening. They would describe it reducing the amount of financial accommodation to make policy less expansionary. This, arguably, describes what happened when the Fed began the tapering discussion. Inflation expectations fell:



And real interest rates rose:

Higher real interest rates and lower inflation expectations looks like a less accommodative/expansionary policy. The Fed began make policy less accommodative in the context of below target inflation and above target unemployment, but unemployment had fallen far enough that they felt it necessary to alter the level of accommodation to prevent incipient inflation pressures. And soon after it became evident that wage growth had bottomed. Coincidence? Probably not. In other words, so far the Federal Reserve is behaving just as they would in any other tightening cycle, with the only difference being that the first step is ending asset purchases rather than raising interest rates.

Moreover, it seems to be clear that the Evans rule was a diversionary tactic. The Fed never foresaw an instance where they would raise rates above as long as unemployment was above 6.5%. Moreover, as is clear from the tapering process, the inflation forecasts, and the interest rate forecast, there was never an intention to target inflation greater than 2.5%. The extra 0.5% was only an allowance for forecast error under the assumption that expected inflation would remain at 2%. They always expected inflation would hit its target from below, and never intended to risk overshooting on inflation.

Simply put, the Fed began unwinding policy pretty much exactly where you would expect given the behavior of unemployment and wage growth. So it is reasonable to believe that if they continue unwinding policy in a historically consistent manner, then there will not be a substantial pause between the end of asset purchases and the beginning of rate hikes. The date of the first rate hike will need to be moved forward by this theory.

They are more likely to move that date forward if they see less slack in labor markets than they currently believe. Furthermore, accelerating wage growth is likely to be the first conclusive evidence of that outcome. Hence my focus on wage growth. I suspect they will argue that if they don’t move forward the date, they will be at risk of having to do more later.

Is the Fed pursuing the right policy? Should they allow wage to rise further before reducing financial accommodation? Well, I would say it is already too late for that. But could they delay rate hikes? I would like to see them do so because absent running the labor market at a red hot pace, I don’t see obvious way to shift the balance of power to labor and reverse this trend:

That said, I would also add that the last two cycles leave me wary about the potential financial stability issues from such a policy. In the absence of a greater fiscal roll, however, we are left with leaning on monetary policy and risking the financial fallout.

Bottom Line: The Federal Reserve’s policy path is dependent on a particular view of a labor market suffering from excessive slack that will continue to be a problem long into the future. It is reasonable to expect that evidence that slack is dissapating more quickly than expected will trigger a fresh assessment among policy makers regarding the appropriate policy path. Next week is probably too soon; later meetings are more likely. Given that wages already appear to be on the rise – a key sign of tightening labor markets – that change could happen quickly. This is not a call for higher rates; it is a warning that higher rates might be coming. This is especially the case if the Fed wants to avoid overshooting. I would argue that their actions to date – the signaling of a shift in policy when still missing on both parts of the dual mandate – suggest an intention to avoid overshooting similar to that of previous cycles.

“Voters are not happy with Obamacare, but they also believe the current system needs to be improved. So it’s important to have a plan rather than just allow the Democrats to complain that the Republicans are the ‘party of no,’” Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster and cofounder of Public Opinion Strategies, tells TIME. “However, this issue will be three parts about Obamacare and one part about the Republican alternative in this election.”

“The core message is running against Obamacare. That is the most effective message,” says Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster and president of North Star Opinion Research. “It becomes even more effective when we can answer the question: What’s your alternative?”

House Speaker John Boehner and his allies will try to answer that question this year, reports The Washington Post, presenting a set of “principles” to mark the party’s official position on health care reform. Among the alternative policies under consideration include the creation of high-risk insurance pools, medical malpractice reform, and allowing people to buy health care insurance across state lines. The key, says Ayres, is “allowing people to buy the coverage they want and can afford, rather than being forced to buy expensive comprehensive policies.”

While various conservative bills have been presented over the years, only recently have Republicans focused its main energy from “repeal” to “repeal and replace.” A month ago the Senate put forth “the most comprehensive and most serious alternative” to the Affordable Care Act since it was introduced, according to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which the House will look to for guidance.

Republicans would have to win elections before seeing their ideas turn into fruition, as the Democrat-controlled Senate and President Obama have guarded the Affordable Care Act from GOP attempts to repeal, defund or fundamentally reform the law. And with 5 million now enrolled in its health care exchanges, the law will be near impossible to replace completely. Even so, Boehner figures positioning the GOP as a “party of alternatives” will convince voters it’s serious about governing.

But it’ll be tempting for Republican candidates in 2014 to focus on blanket opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Nearly 54 percent of the public opposes the Affordable Care Act, according to an aggregation of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics. Its popularity hasn’t risen much since 2010, when Boehner, then House Minority Leader, held a rousing “Hell, No!” call-and-response with his conference against the bill. As Boehner and his lieutenants move toward a potential replacement four years later, Bolger expects that the country will remain intent on the existing legislation.

“Voters are focused on Obamacare so much—it is the law, and has been debated for five years,” he says. “The GOP alternative won’t get anywhere near the attention levels.”

So despite the new calls for change, don’t be surprised to hear the echoes of Hell No.###1541||###1542||DUBLIN — Yes, they have more bananas.

Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world”s biggest banana supplier.

The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.

The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world”s No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.

Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday”s deal valued Fyffes shares at $1.66.

Fyffes rose 46 percent to $1.80 on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.

Fyffes, pronounced “Fifes,” is Europe”s biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company”s presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.

David McCann, Fyffes” chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.

Lonergan said their “natural strategic partnership” would “provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.”

However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren”t expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.###1543||Empty###1544||###1545||The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has expanded to cover an impossibly vast swath of Asia extending from Kazakhstan to Australia, with Malaysia appealing for as many airplanes and ships as the world can provide.

The countries where the Boeing 777 and the 239 people aboard could have gone, based on a signal picked up by a satellite, stretch north and west from the plane’s last known location and include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. Another arc stretches south and west between Indonesia and Australia and well into the Indian Ocean.

“We are looking at large tracts of land … as well as deep and remote oceans,” Malaysia’s acting transportation minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said Sunday at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, the capital.

In February, the automaker recalled more than 1.5 million vehicles for a faulty ignition switch linked to 13 deaths.

Vehicles on the GM recall list include 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006 and 2007 Chevy HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky, 2005-2007 Chevy Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5S.

The company first learned of the problem a decade earlier.

When CBS News aired its first investigative report into the problem, Vicki Harrington said she was scared. Two teenage girls were killed when a Chevrolet Cobalt went off the road in 2006. For Harrington, a mother from West Des Moines, the similarities between the crash and her daughter’s vehicle were startling.

“It was a 2005 Cobalt that they were driving, and hers is a 2006,” she said.

Her daughter, Katie, has been driving a Chevy Cobalt for about six years. A few weeks ago she attempted to get its ignition fixed at an authorized GM dealership. However, the dealership told her its hands were tied and offered no solutions.

GM is offering free loaner vehicles while it waits for parts to arrive for repairs or $500 toward the purchase of a new car.

GM dealerships across the metro would not respond to requests for comment on how many drivers the recall affected.

“Sometimes they don’t think it’s significant enough or it’s not enough vehicles having the problem,” said local mechanic John Merriam.

A faulty ignition switch can cause the engine to shut down and disable airbags.

GM indicated Wednesday that it knows of 31 crashes and 13 deaths that resulted from recalled vehicles, leaving Harrington looking elsewhere for her daughter’s next car.

“The way they’ve handled this whole situation has just been completely unacceptable,” Harrington said.

We are disappointed the City has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit. It will now be resolved through the legal process.”

PREVIOUS, 11:26 AM: Time Warner Cable is about to learn what happens when City Hall takes you on. L.A. City Attorney Mike Feuer said today that he’s going after the cable giant in a nearly $10 million lawsuit (read it here) alleging that TWC has refused to pay fees owed the city since 2011 while at the same time raking in billions in revenue. “Time Warner pocketed the money from its subscribers and didn’t turn it over to the City of LA,” Feuer said during a press conference this morning downtown. “That money would have funded 100 police officers and miles of sidewalk repair,” he said. The city is demanding Time Warner Cable pay up on $9,697,896 owed – $2,512,490 in 2008 and 2009 franchise and Public, Educational, Government use (PEG) fees, plus $7,185,406 in 2010 and 2011 franchise and PEG fees. Feuer added that the suit, filed this morning in federal court, has nothing to do with flailing carriage negotiations for TWC’s newly launched Dodgers cable network and how millions in LA will not be able to watch the team unless they are TWC subscribers.

The news comes as TWC navigates the regulatory waters associated with its proposed mega-merger with Comcast, which is acquiring it for $42.5 billion. That deal was announced last month. Feuer said he couldn’t speak to how the suit would effect the proposed merger or if the cable giant would play hardball in reaction to the city’s legal action. “How Time Warner responds to this lawsuit is their business,” he said.

Evidence indicating that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that went missing 10 days ago was sabotaged or hijacked was mounting after it emerged that the last message from the cockpit was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

The last words -- "All right, good night" -- were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a media briefing.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid are under scanner of the probe into the disappearance of the plane.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's final words.

The officials are also looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian - had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.

Malaysia's defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, "I can confirm that search and rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun.

Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations." A detailed map of the northern and southern corridors where the search operations were on was released today.

Malaysia got in touch with countries along the northern and southern corridors about the flight.

These countries include: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and France.

Australian was leading the search of the remote southern Indian Ocean for the missing plane.

Kazakhstan joined the search today in the farthest northwest section of the search area, taking the total number of countries involved in the operation to 26.

During the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of China.

Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search operation, Hishammuddin said.

PTI###1552||Delta flight from Orlando to Atlanta loses wing panel

The flight left at 5:30 p.m. from Orlando International Airport, but McDuff did not know when the panel popped off the right wing. The flight landed about 7: 30 p.m. at Hartsdale-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

None of the 179 passengers and six crew members suffered injury, according to Delta spokeswoman Lindsay McDuff.

An investigation is underway to determine why a wing panel fell off a Boeing 757 passenger jet Sunday on an afternoon Delta Air Lines flight from Orlando to Atlanta.

"It looks like the entire panel came off," according to Associate Professor Chuck Horning, chairman of the Department of Aviation Maintenance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach. "One of the first things they will probably do is look at the maintenance logs to see when it was last removed."

Having looked at a photograph taken by a passenger on the flight, Horning said the sizable panel came from the forward edge of the right wing close to the fuselage. Made of plastic composite material with a honeycomb core, the light-weight panel provides access to the right landing gear assembly and is attached to the wing structure with screws.

Besides routine maintenance, passenger jets commonly undergo complete overhauls about every 10 years.

"It does happen that panels do come off an airplane but it's not an everyday occurrence," Horning said.

A check of the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System maintained by NASA did not show any panels lost in flight in recent years. Much more common were incidents of flight crew fatigue, equipment failures and navigational errors.

The Boeing 757 first went into service in the 1980's but there was no information on when that particular aircraft was built. More than 1,000 of the twin-engine jets were built before the model went out of production in 2005.###1553||PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds had all the markings of being a success.

$11 million+ in revenue. In just three days. That’s more than 360,000 copies sold at $30/each. It’s actually more when you factor in Steam’s cut (30% is the number floating around). Everyone’s favorite source of Steam stats, Steamspy, shows around 235,000 copies (plus/minus 13,800). These Steamspy numbers aren’t set in stone for any game. Think of them as ballpark figures instead. Plus, Battlegrounds was sold via their own website during the closed beta period.

According to the data, the number of PUBG Steam owners sits at more than 36,604,134. The data leak was fixed on July 1, so that number is higher by now. Arstechnica dumped the total player count data for more than 13,000 games into a CSV file. Check it out and see where your favorite games stack up.

PUBG has pushed past 50 million units worldwide according to the developer. That’s combined sales between Xbox One and PC. Toss in PUBG Mobile, and there are over 400 million registered PUBG players worldwide. 87+ million log in and play every day across all platforms.

The devs are celebrating the huge milestones with a PUBG sale. Starting later today through July 5th, you can pick up PUBG for $19.99 ($10 off its usual price).

Bluehole also took a portion of the announcement to say “there’s still so much we can do to make PUBG a better game for our players.” Yep, there are parts of the game that are still frustrating (loot density, performance issues), but damn I love it. Barely a day goes by where I don’t fire PUBG up for at least a match or two.

It’s been a while since the last update. 20 million sales came and went. 8 months after release and PUBG is still showing little signs of slowing up. Sales are now past 24 million. 30 million total copies shouldn’t be too far away with the Xbox One version coming next week.

Just saw that PUBG is up to 24 million units sold. In 8 months. Insane. New map reveal coming tomorrow night @thegameawards with some more news too 🙂 — Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) December 6, 2017

10/11/17 UPDATE

PUBG did it. 2 million concurrent players. 2,016,498 to be precise according to Steam’s own player count tracking. SteamSpy gives us a look at how the audience breaks down across the world. The US saw a dip recently as the holiday rush of games begins (Destiny 2?). But that dip didn’t even register thanks to the massive surge in popularity in China.

For example, yes, PUBG did decline a bit in the US lately but it was offset by skyrocketing player base in China and Korea pic.twitter.com/7iIUk5WxBs — Steam Spy (@Steam_Spy) October 11, 2017

We don’t often see hard numbers like this for the Chinese audience, but it shows just how big games can be over there.

Sales are also up to at least 15.5 million according to SteamSpy.

10/09/17 UPDATE

PUBG continues its meteoric rise as SteamSpy puts its sales at over 14 million. We haven’t received an official sales update in a little while, but the upward trajectory matches the growth in concurrent player numbers. The 2 million milestone will fall any day now. SteamCharts has the peak player count at 1,984,278. That’s more than the peak player numbers for Dota 2, CS:GO, Team Fortress 2, ARK, Rocket League and Warframe combined.

9/26/2017 UPDATE

PUBG success just doesn’t stop. SteamSpy has the total number of owners at 12.2 million, give or take 100,000.

Bluehole’s Battle Royale game already crushed the record for concurrent players, but they still have their work cut out for them to become the most owned game on Steam (that isn’t free to play). The top spot belongs to CS:GO with nearly 34 million owners.

Another crazy stat courtesy of SteamSpy is 76%. That’s the number of total PUBG owners that have played the game in the last two weeks. That’s crazy retention for a game out six months already. Newer games often see retention rates like this, but they tend to fall quickly. Take Divinity: Original Sin 2. 82% of its owners have played in the past two weeks. But that number won’t stay like that for long.

Players are not only jumping on the PUBG bandwagon. They’re staying on it.

9/14/2017 UPDATE

11 million+ now. That’s according to SteamSpy, which has been underestimating the official numbers by about a million. Either SteamSpy is getting better at tracking sales or PUBG’s incredible growth is only accelerating. I’m guessing a mix of both. Peak player counts this morning rose over 1.13 million. The once insurmountable DOTA 2 record of 1.29 concurrent players looks likely to fall soon.

9/05/2017 UPDATE

10 million and counting. That’s the latest sales numbers from PlayerUnknown himself.

10 MILLION SOLD! Never did I think we would reach such a number! Thank you all for your continuing support of the @PUBATTLEGROUNDS team <3 — PLAYERUNKNOWN (@PLAYERUNKNOWN) September 5, 2017

A quick look at SteamSpy shows the website lagging about one million behind. Peak player numbers continue to grow with 962,950 playing this morning. It’ll be interesting what kind of impact Destiny 2’s launch will have on peak numbers tomorrow and the rest of the week.

8/30/2017 UPDATE

Everyday brings another new peak player count for PUBG. Today, it hit 887,895. SteamSpy puts sales at around 8.5 million copies right now. This number is lagging as it struggles to keep up with the accelerated growth PUBG has seen in the past month. It wouldn’t surprise me if the real number is at 9 million or past it already.

8/22/2017 UPDATE

SteamSpy can’t keep up with PUBG’s blistering sales rate. Bluehole announced at Gamescom their hit game has already eclipsed 8 million sales. And that’s not even the craziest number. PUBG hit a new peak player record today with 718,978 players. That’s within 70,000 players of DOTA 2.

I wasn’t sure if PUBG could ever get close to CSGO’s record peak player of 850,000, but it’s showing no signs of slowing down. It’s looking more like a matter of if than when. A stunning success that has to be exceeding even Bluehole’s wildest dreams.

8/16/2017 UPDATE

Well that was fast. SteamSpy puts sales of PUBG at 7 million+. Peak player counts are surging right alongside with a new high of 614,000+. It’s inching ever closer to CS:GO’s 850,000+ high.

8/11/2017 UPDATE

Let’s check in on PUBG. The hottest game out there continues to sell at a blistering rate. SteamSpy pegs the current sales number at around 6.5 million copies. And it’s an engaged audience. Peak player counts are closing in on 580,000. CS:GO has a comfortable hold on the #2 spot for all-time peak players at 850,000. PUBG has its work cut out to dethrone the 1-2 punch of DOTA 2 and CS:GO. At least, for the all-time peak number. PUBG is already starting to eclipse CS:GO in daily peak players. PUBG had 559,613 players earlier today. CS:GO? 520,209 players.

7/28/2017 UPDATE

Folks just can’t seem to get enough of PUBG. Another week, another milestone. 6 million copies have been sold according to developer Bluehole. On top of that, a new concurrent peak is being hit right now with 429,723 people vying for a serving of chicken dinner. I knew Battlegrounds would be popular, but I don’t think anyone thought it would put up these kind of numbers. And Bluehole still hasn’t tapped into the console market yet.

Today’s new concurrent peak puts PUBG within about 40,000 of passing Fallout 4 for the #3 spot on Steam’s all-time top 10.

And that $11 million in revenue over its first three days is now around $180 million four months later.

7/17/2017 UPDATE

The big news today centers around player count. PUBG has passed one of the juggernauts of gaming and now sits with the fourth highest peak player count on Steam. Ever. With 382,561 peak players, PUBG passes GTA V. Only Fallout 4, CSGO and Dota 2 have higher peak player counts.

Again, your support of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS astounds me! We just surpassed GTAV & achieved the 4th highest peak player count on @steam_games <3 pic.twitter.com/UGtSJX3GYR — PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) July 16, 2017

Fallout 4 is within reach, but it’s hard to imagine any game challenging CSGO at 850,000+ or Dota 2 at 1.29 million+.

As for sales numbers? We haven’t heard any recent official numbers, but SteamSpy shows the game closing in on 5 million sales. I knew Battle Royale was popular and loved it on H1Z1, but PUBG’s success is insane. And well deserved. I can’t stop playing it.

Bluehole pushed a more polished Battle Royale experience at just the right time, and backed it up with tremendous support. With continuous updates and new maps on the way, PUBG should only continue to grow.

6/22/2017 UPDATE

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds just passed 4 million copies. In three months. Fantastic sales for a fantastic game. Congrats to ‘PlayerUnknown’ and the Bluehole team for delivering a great game and keeping it up with plenty of updates and fixes.

3 months… 4 million copies of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS sold… Thank you all again for your continuing support <3 — PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) June 22, 2017

6/5/2017 UPDATE

The playerbase for PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds continues to surge higher. SteamSpy estimates almost 3 million owners for the game. And those buying can’t stop playing Peak concurrent players peaked at 209,081 players over the weekend. That’s just shy of breaking into the top 5 for most peak players ever. No Man’s Sky sits at the fifth spot with 212,321.

Developer Bluehole continues to keep fans of the game updated on a day-to-day basis. Updates to fix bugs come every week and monthly updates bring new content and features. Look for another (unannounced) weapon this month. Plus, the team is busy working on two new maps and game modes.

Developer support plus a more polished Battle Royale experience than anything on the market right now propelled Battlegrounds near the top of Steam’s charts.

5/20/17 UPDATE

SteamSpy is now showing 2 million owners. We haven’t received an official number since the beginning of the month, but Battlegrounds’ popularity is only growing. Peak player counts are now hitting north of 170,000. Today, 173,386 players were trying to grab chicken dinner at one point. The all-time peak sits at 174,287 players.

Despite the surge in players on Battlegrounds, H1Z1: King of the Kill is proving resilient. It hit just over 124,000 peak players earlier today.

It’s been crazy watching the growth of the Battle Royale genre over the past year. Last May, H1Z1 was only averaging 8,000 players at any one point. Over the past 30 days, it’s nearly 70,000. For Battlegrounds, it’s just over 96,000.

5/2/17 UPDATE

2 million sales. I can’t imagine how PlayerUnknown and the folks at Bluehole feel passing another milestone. SteamSpy data is lagging a bit as it shows 1,766,374 (plus/minus 36,753). Peak player count is regularly hitting 120,000+. I’ve seen it as high as 140,000 over the past week. A huge success for a great game.

4/27/17 UPDATE

Battlegrounds continues to build on its launch success. According to SteamSpy, the number of owners now sits at 1,578,332 (plus/minus 36,564). Remember, use these figures as ballpark estimates. Not hard numbers.

The player rising is rising right alongside the number of owners. We have a Battle Royale near the top of Steam’s top games chart with Battlegrounds and H1Z1 fighting for the 3rd and 4th spot. Right now, 103,254 people are on Battlegrounds. 103,055 are fighting on H1Z1: King of the Kill.

Man, whoever gets their game on console first is going to see a ton more sales. Hell, I would double dip on Xbox One.

4/10/17 UPDATE

We wouldn’t have reached this amazing milestone without the tremendous support shown by our players and content creators. Thank you all <3 https://t.co/siRiG4CNh0 — PLAY BATTLEGROUNDS (@PUBATTLEGROUNDS) April 10, 2017

Battlegrounds is showing no signs of slowing down as it breaks 1 million+ copies sold. Huge congrats to the Bluehole team for creating an absolutely awesome experience. SteamSpy puts the owners at 916,186 (plus/minus 27,819). Peak concurrent players is pushing 90,000 daily.

4/4/17 UPDATE

Battlegrounds continues its impressive launch. According to SteamSpy, the number of owners now sits at 679,209 (plus/minus 23,031). Peak daily players are up 74,000.

Original story continues below.

150,000 Twitch viewers at times. King of the Kill was already a popular game among many of the top streamers. A lot of them moved over to Battlegrounds at launch. More than 3,600 Twitch streams have entertained countless viewers. A look at it right now shows nearly 100,000 viewers in the early afternoon. Only League of Legends has more viewers.

You can see King of the Kill slipped out of the top 10 on Twitch right now.

67,000+ concurrent players. That’s enough to get PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds into the top 10 on Steam’s most played games. Up there with the likes of Dota 2, CSGO, King of the Kill, GTA and Rocket League.

While the game’s launch has been incredibly impressive, H1Z1 is still hitting higher concurrent players. Today, King of the Kill hit nearly 110,000 players at one point. We’ll see how the tug of war between the Battle Royale giants shake out over the coming weeks and months.

Don’t expect H1Z1 to go down quietly. Yes, the game is stale for some – but evidently not for many. It weathered the launch of Battlegrounds better than I thought it would. Still, Daybreak Games has to be feeling pressure from Bluehole. Battlegrounds strengths are King of the Kill’s biggest weaknesses. Weapon variety, the map and gunplay are all better on Battlegrounds.

That’s not to say Battlegrounds doesn’t have its share of issues. The biggest one right now is the servers. It doesn’t happen all the time, but rubberbanding is an issue. And there are performance issues on certain areas of the map.

Bluehole is addressing these performance issues and plans to release patches to fix them. Here’s what the dev had to say in a recent blog post.

One important thing to note. Client optimization takes time, and will not be solved in one single patch. We will be working hard over the next 6 months to ensure all players enjoy smooth gameplay with no lag or FPS drops.

We’ll see how they do. For me, Battlegrounds is running fantastic. Outside of the server issues I mentioned above, I haven’t run into any problems. I know that might not be the case for everyone, but the devs seem committed to getting the game running great across a variety of PC and settings.

Did you pick up PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds? What do you think so far?###1554||###1555||Large Cap Actiev Stocks: Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HTZ), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)

Industrial production in the first two months of the year grew 8.6 per cent year on year, the slowest rate since the global financial crisis, after rising 9.7 per cent in December, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed yesterday.

Fixed asset investment rose 17.9 per cent in January and February, the least since 2002 and compared with full-year growth of 19.6 per cent last year.

Retail sales growth cooled to 11.8 per cent in the two months from 13.6 per cent in December.

Power production, an indicator of industrial demand, grew a weak 5.5 per cent.

We achieved the growth target last year … why can’t we make it again this year?

PREMIER LI KEQIANG

Following earlier data that showed an 18.1 per cent slump in exports last month, the latest figures add to the challenges faced by Beijing in stabilising jobs and launching economic and social reforms.

"January-February data suggests that manufacturing activities will have to accelerate [this month] to help the economy deliver 7.5 per cent growth in [the first quarter]," ANZ Bank economists led by Liu Ligang said in a research note. "We believe that a policy easing could be under way."

Watch: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says debt defaults 'hardly avoidable'

Liu said Beijing might increase fiscal spending and cut banks' reserve ratio requirements to sustain growth.

But Julian Evans-Pritchard, an Asia economist at London-based Capital Economics, said a policy shift was unlikely.

"Despite this broad evidence of a slowdown, we don't think policymakers will necessarily step in to support growth," Evans-Pritchard said.

Li also played down the prospect of immediate intervention to stem a further slowdown.

The "biggest challenge" the central government faced last year was growing downside risks in the economy, including a fall in fiscal revenue, a sudden tightening of liquidity in the interbank system, and a slump in power usage, he said at a press conference yesterday following the end of the annual session of the National People's Congress.

"We managed to achieve the economic growth target last year without resorting to short-term stimulus policy," he said. "Why can't we make it again this year?"

Li said challenges might be more complex this year as Beijing needed to combat not only a slowdown, but also problems including pollution and financial risks arising from the shadow banking system and accumulation of local government debt.

The government aimed to keep economic growth in "a proper range" to ensure enough jobs were created, he said, adding that this year's growth target of "about 7.5 per cent" was flexible.

The mainland's gross domestic product grew 7.7 per cent last year, continuing an easing trend following 2007's peak of 14.2 per cent, on the back of weaker domestic and external demand.###1558||Studying the long-term effects of the Affordable Care Act, the Congressional Budget Office recently projected a drop in hours worked equivalent to having 2 million fewer full-time workers in the workplace in 2017. Several factors play into this forecast, but one major driver is the flexibility offered by available affordable health insurance. So how will the new law affect your ability to retire early?

You may be eligible for deeply discounted health insurance

Insurance premiums for older men and women are expected to drop by 19% and 32%, respectively, under the Affordable Care Act, according to a recent study. This will decrease the amount of out-of-pocket premium dollars this population will need to spend on health insurance, meaning they will need less money to cover health expenditures.

Furthermore, health insurance companies are no longer allowed to refuse coverage or increase premiums based on pre-existing conditions or the age of the enrollee. Before the ACA, many Americans needed the insurance benefits offered through their work -- and therefore stuck with a full-time job. But if health insurance is available at a lower cost, older Americans could choose to retire and purchase coverage through the exchanges.

Premium costs are expected to drop thanks to tax credits -- essentially discounts on monthly premiums. Enrollees can qualify for tax credits based on their family size and income, and this may allow them to work less or not at all. The ability to purchase affordable health insurance is not the only reason people may consider working less: Premium costs decrease as income decreases, so there is an incentive to work less and therefore to earn less. The regulations for the 48 contiguous states are:

$11,490 to $45,960 for individuals

$15,510 to $62,040 for a family of 2

$19,530 to $78,120 for a family of 3

$23,550 to $94,200 for a family of 4

$27,570 to $110,280 for a family of 5

$31,590 to $126,360 for a family of 6

$35,610 to $142,440 for a family of 7

$39,630 to $158,520 for a family of 8

Community rating restrictions require health insurance providers to offer policies to their costliest beneficiaries at no more than three times what they charge to their least-costly ones -- regardless of health status. As a result, older Americans will, on average, see a 13% drop in their premiums -- as opposed to a 75% spike in costs for the youngest group of insured Americans.

This drop in cost for older Americans may mean less of a need for employer-based insurance, less money needed in their 401(k) accounts, and, therefore, less time spent in the workforce.

For example, using the Covered California shop-and-compare tool, a couple in San Francisco, both age 55 and with a household income of $60,000, could find bronze coverage for $2 per month after premium tax credits. While not all prices are so low, this exemplifies just how affordable some plans can be.

Medicaid expansion may be your ticket

Medicaid is expanding in some states, and this expansion will cover a group of newly eligible individuals: people between 19 and 65 who have an income below 138% of the federal poverty level ($15,856 this year for a single person), meet citizenship requirements, are not incarcerated, and do not qualify for Medicare.

The expansion of Medicaid benefits is made possible through federal funding mandated by the ACA, and will result in a having higher number of Americans qualify for additional health-care benefits -- making early retirement possible for some. Beware, though, that Medicaid expansion has not been approved in all states. You can find information about your state here.

Some important care is now free

Marketplace insurance plans cover a set of free preventive health benefits that are not subject to a copayment or deductible. Certain tests and screenings have specific criteria based on health and age, and some may be more applicable than others, so don't worry about getting every screening just because it's free. There are some screenings that everyone should consider getting, and women have an additional set of benefits to take advantage of. While these free benefits are an exciting part of the Affordable Care Act, know that they are free only when performed by an in-network provider.

link###1559||PORTLAND, Ore. - Nutrition and supplement company Herbalife (HLF) says that it is facing an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission.

The company's shares initially plunged more than 12 percent following a brief halt in trading pending the announcement.

Herbalife said that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. The FTC's website says that these are used to investigate possible "unfair or deceptive acts or practices." A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to elaborate.



The company, which has faced accusations of operating a pyramid scheme, said that it welcomes the inquiry given the "tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace" about its business.

Herbalife says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully.



The company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Los Angeles, uses a network of distributors to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products globally.

The FTC inquiry comes just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company.

Ackman has bet against the company and said repeatedly that he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme, which is when a company makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products that they sell.

The head of Pershing Square Capital Management resumed this effort Tuesday, holding a public event to detail his firm's claims of how its Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme in China, violating laws there. Pershing declined to comment Wednesday on the FTC investigation.

Herbalife has repeatedly denied the claims and rival investor Carl Icahn has disagreed as well, taking his fight against Ackman public and increasing his stake in the company.

Herbalife shares fell $3.81, or 5.8 percent, to $61.58 in mid-afternoon trading after falling as low as $54.59 earlier. Its shares had fallen almost 17 percent so far this year through Tuesday's close.

###1560||Brutal winter weather is holding back the global economy, but it's on track for solid growth later in the year, a major economic think-tank says.

The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development said in its quarterly assessment for the global economy that the world's developed economies are generally performing strongly and getting back to levels of growth and activity that existed before 2008, when the recession began.

It's a different story on North America, however, which has been dealing with a particularly nasty bout of winter weather. It's been so bad that growth is expected to be negligible when the data come in for the first three months, in both the U.S. and Canada.

U.S. growth is expected to come in at around 1.7 per cent for the January to March period. In Canada, the number is even bleaker — a mere 0.5 per cent. Both figures are well behind growth rates seen elsewhere in the developed world.

The average growth rate across G7 countries is expected to be 2.2 per cent.

"The United States and Canada are both also expected to experience an uneven pattern of growth in the near term, owing in part to the disruptive effect of repeated episodes of severe winter weather," the think-tank said.

"A number of activities were restrained by the storms and cold temperatures, which is likely to depress first-quarter GDP, with some bounceback effect in the second quarter in the absence of further negative shocks."

But the slowdown, even in chilly North America, will be temporary, the OECD says, after winter eventually releases its icy grip. Canada's economy will expand by 2.4 per cent in the spring quarter, the OECD predicts.

In almost all economies, consensus forecasts for 2014 have ratcheted up over the last few months.

The North American slowdown actually started in the last quarter of 2013, as the U.S. government shutdown caused economic activity overall to be slower than it would have been otherwise.###1561||Empty###1562||You are the owner of this article.###1563||On Friday, Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. failed to make an 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million) interest payment, the first domestic corporate bond default in the history of the People’s Republic of China.

The company, in the red for three straight years, narrowly avoided missing an interest payment on its five-year, billion yuan obligation in January 2013. Then, the Shanghai municipality leaned on banks to not press claims on overdue loans so that Chaori could pay bondholders.

This time, Shanghai officials sat on their hands after the company issued a warning on Tuesday that it was able to pay only a small portion—less than five percent—of the interest coming due. Even more remarkably, authorities let Chaori default during the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, a particularly sensitive moment in the Chinese political calendar.

Analysts correctly praised Beijing for not rescuing the solar panel company. After all, the missed payment for the first time introduced the concept of risk in the $1.4 trillion corporate bond market, where investors were blindly chasing offerings with the highest coupons regardless of the creditworthiness of issuers.

Central government technocrats were smart to pick a marginal issuer for the first failure, yet there is nonetheless cause for concern. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in aresearch note issued on the Wednesday after the company’s warning, called the then-potential default China’s “Bear Stearns moment.”

That assessment angered Xinhua News Agency. “Indeed,” the official Chinese organ noted in a commentary, “it is hard to grasp how a potential default of the bond—163 million U.S. dollars in principal and rated as junk by Shenzhen-based Pengyuan Credit—could be likened to the systemically important investment bank Bear Stearns with hundreds of billions of dollars on its balance sheet at the time.”

Clearly, Chaori is not Bear Stearns, but what the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists were referring to was the July 2007 disclosure of problems at two Bear Stearns subprime hedge funds. That event is considered to have ignited a burn that eventually triggered the global panic the following year. As the strategists noted, “We doubt that the financial system in China will experience a liquidity crunch immediately because of this default but we think the chain reaction will probably start.”

Will it? Most observers think not. “Though China’s financial system faces many serious challenges, the government has far greater power to prevent a disorderly collapse than its Western counterparts did,” notes Reuters’s Peter Thal Larsen, writing on the Dealbook site of the New York Times. “If fears of a Bear Stearns moment have any value, it is to serve as a reminder to the Chinese authorities which mistakes they must avoid at all costs.”

Yes, Chinese authorities have the benefit of hindsight, but they face an almost-impossible situation. Even if they make every decision correctly, they will, in all probability, be the victim of what Philip Li of China Chengxin International Credit Rating last week called “a domino effect.”

Consider the challenges. It is no secret why Chaori defaulted. The solar industry in China is notorious for overcapacity and weak prices. The country, of course, is littered with Chaoris, but solar panel overproduction is just the beginning of the story. In the “green” sector, you will find excess wind turbine factories, for instance. And there are far too many coal mines, steel mills, smelters, and ship yards. Need glass or cement? China is certainly the place to go to hook up with an idle producer. Gross overproduction helps explain why the producer price index, which measures factory gate prices, fell in February for the 24th consecutive month.

Up to now, Beijing has been able to bail out loss-making industries, but that has to change because the economy is slowing fast. The manufacturing sector, measured by the HSBC purchasing managers’ index, contracted in both January and February. In the first two months of this year—aggregated for statistical purposes to eliminate the distortion caused by the Lunar New Year holiday—exports fell 1.6% over the same period in 2013. The number of urban job openings, as evidenced by surveys announced by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, fell both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Tellingly, city jobs in Q4 fell a stunning 13.7% from the preceding quarter.

If the economy continues to erode, there must be a series of defaults. Expect troubles soon, especially in the second half of this year. Haitong Securities, China’s second-largest brokerage, estimates that 5.3 trillion yuan of trust products will come due this year.

Businesses could have an especially hard time rolling over obligations. Chaori, as small and unimportant as it is, appears to be already affecting China’s credit markets. In the last few days, four debt issuers postponed offerings, and at last count at least 6.6 billion yuan of domestic bond sales have been delayed. One of the disappointed companies, Suining Chuanzhong Economic Technology Development, blamed Chaori, saying it had “triggered severe upheaval in the bond market.” Observers think high-yield issuers will soon be paying 200 basis points more for money.

“In the U.S., it took about a year to reach the Lehman stage when the market panicked and the shadow banking sector froze,” the Bank of America Merrill Lynch note pointed out last week. “It may take less time in China as the market is less transparent.”

In any event, there is now too much debt for Beijing to handle. Since the end of 2007, the amount of corporate bonds has risen more than 10 times. Assets in trusts—most of them risky—skyrocketed 46% last year. Even though China’s economy, if properly reported, is about half that of the U.S., the amount of Chinese corporate debt could overtake America’s this year.

China, in recent years, has created too much indebtedness too fast. Chaori’s default on Friday is a warning of what will inevitably occur next.

China is losing patience with Malaysian efforts to coordinate the search and has demanded more accurate information about the missing plane.

Carney is due to appear before the Treasury Select Committee just days after the Bank suspended an employee over compliance concerns following an internal probe.

His deputy Andrew Bailey has already admitted that claims linking the Bank to the burgeoning forex scandal - which regulators say threatens to match the seriousness of Libor rate-rigging - could prove "enormously damaging".

Carney is due to give evidence about the allegations during a marathon three-part session which will also see him questioned over the abandonment of his flagship "forward guidance" policy on interest rates as well as Scottish independence.

The Bank was dragged into the forex affair - which is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - after a Bloomberg report centring on a meeting between officials and bank traders in 2012.

It was claimed that at the meeting, the traders admitted to the practice of sharing information about customer orders before currency benchmarks are set - an alleged practice at the heart of an ongoing regulatory probe into market manipulation.

They were said to have been told that there was no policy on these communications and that banks should make their own rules.

Bailey stressed during an appearance before MPs last month that the Bank did not condone any market manipulation and that it took the claims "very seriously".

Last week, it said it had found no evidence that its staff had been involved in forex manipulation, but revealed it had suspended a member of staff while it investigated compliance with internal control processes.

It has called in law firm Travers Smith to assist with its investigation into what its officials might have known about forex rigging or information-sharing in the market.

The Bank's internal review has so far covered around 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chat room records and more than 40 hours of telephone call recordings.

Regulators worldwide - including the FCA in Britain - are investigating a number of firms and their foreign exchange trading activities as part of a major probe of the £3 trillion a day forex market.

They are looking into whether currency traders shared information about their positions and knowledge of client orders through instant messages to rig the foreign exchange market in their favour.###1569||Empty###1570||Empty###1571||Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) on Monday reported an 8 percent increase in profit for the fourth quarter from last year, helped mainly by lower income tax expense. Sales climbed 6 percent and gross margins improved.

Earnings for the quarter easily beat Street analysts' estimates, but sales failed to meet expectations due to weak performance from the company's namesake brand and the harsh winter that made shoppers stay at home. The company also had to contend with the heavy discounting and heightened competition during the holiday season.

Moving forward, Chief Executive Richard Hayne said that while customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at its Anthropologie and Free People brands have been strong, but continued challenges at the Urban Outfitters brand may cast some pressure in the current quarter.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Urban Outfitters' fourth-quarter profit rose to $88.7 million or $0.59 per share from $82.5 million or $0.56 per share last year. On average, 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $0.55 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.

Sales for the quarter quarter grew 6 percent to $905.9 million from $856.8 million last year. Thirty analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $927.86 million for the period.

Comparable retail segment net sales, which include comparable direct-to- consumer channel, increased 1 percent. Comparable retail segment sales increased 20 percent at Free People, 10 percent at Anthropologie and dropped 9 percent at the namesake chain.

Urban Outfitters, which operates stores under its namesake brand as well as Anthropologie and Free People, has been able to post revenue growth and improved profits for the past few quarters, amid the ongoing uncertain economic conditions.

During the quarter, the company's gross margin improved 10 basis points from last year to 36.7 percent. But selling and general expenses increased to $202.9 million from $181.8 million a year ago.

However, the bottom line was helped by a $10 million decrease in income tax expense to $41 million, the company said.

URBN closed Monday's trading at $37.51, down $0.05 or 0.13%, on the Nasdaq. In after hours, the stock further dropped $1.01 or 2.69% at $36.50.

The first consists of spreadsheets, calculators and frightening rules of thumb to guide workers and retirees in their saving and spending decisions.

The other reality exists in the space where Mom and Pop Retiree actually live. That is the true reality, the one you’ll probably be living in yourself when you leave your last job.

It is little examined, despite the heavy volume of regularly published reports on retirement expectations and projections.

Yet we know a few things about the way real people actually retire. Typically, they haven’t saved 25 times their annual spending, as is often recommended. Nor do they switch fromstocks to bonds on the day they retire, which incidentally is probably before they reach the Social Security Administration’s “full retirement age” of 66.

They don’t carefully calculate their monthly spending plans based on their Excel spreadsheets (unless they are engineers). They don’t change their personalities when they retire. They typically enjoy retirement life and enjoy participating in the same kinds of activities that gave them pleasure before they retired.

Workers should plan and prepare for retirement. But they’re more likely to succeed if they plan for what actually lies ahead. Here are a few things we know to be true about retirement now.

– Reality: You’ll spend less than you think. But only after you spend more than you think.

Much is made of the idea that you need to plan on spending 80 percent to 100 percent of the amount you spend in your final years of work. But that isn’t even close to true. Most people spend a lot in their first year or two of retirement when they take long deferred trips, fix up the house, invest in hobbies and the like.

But over time, retiree spending drops substantially. Households headed by people over the age of 75 spend just 72 percent of what households headed by people between the ages of 65 and 74 do, and they spend just 63 percent of what households headed by people 55-64 do, according to an analysis of U.S. Department of Labor figures by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The firm recently did a wide-ranging review of retirement practices. Household spending actually peaks in households led by 48 year olds; their spending is almost cut in half by the time they are over 75.

– Reality: You won’t work until you are 70. Now, workers are regularly told that they will benefit greatly if they work until they are 70, and hold off until that age before collecting Social Security benefits. That’s true – but not very realistic.

In fact, fewer than 2 percent of retirees make it to 70 before they start drawing on Social Security, JPMorgan found. The average retirement age is 61, according to a recent Gallup survey. Many people who intend to work until they are 70 find themselves pushed out of jobs or having to retire for health reasons far earlier than they expect. Given this reality, it’s smart for early retirees to get professional help figuring out whether they are better off drawing down savings and deferring Social Security benefits or starting those benefits earlier and protecting their savings.

– Reality: Your spending won’t be stable and you may not want your income to be. Retirees spend much of their money in chunks. They buy a car one year, take a trip in another, reach into their savings to help grandchildren go to college. Sometimes they have lean years, where they stay home and concentrate on their gardens and reading. As their health falters, they spend large sums of money in short amounts of time paying for care.

Retirees also don’t inflate their spending on an annual basis to match the Consumer Price Index, investment firm T. Rowe Price has found. They tend to hold savings withdrawals somewhat stable from one year to the next. And they do allow their spending to be somewhat responsive to market returns, cinching those belts tighter after losing years and spending a little more freely after experiencing high returns.

That means that a proper retirement nest egg allows for that variability – it keeps some money liquid and doesn’t tie up too much in annuity products that pay out the same amount of money month in and month out.

JP Morgan Asset Management’s chief findings were in this area. It found that the so-called 4 percent rule of thumb for retirement withdrawals may not be the best way to calculate them. Retirees willing to adjust their withdrawals annually based on market returns, and willing to forego annual inflation adjustments can actually start their retirements withdrawing 5 percent or more of assets in their first year of retirement, depending on their age.

– You probably won’t run out of money. Most retirees don’t spend blithely at a pre-conceived rate until their larders are empty and the money’s all gone. They constrain their spending more gradually to match their resources. Those people who do literally run out of money tend to be older, sicker people who depend upon Medicaid funding to pay for costly nursing home care.

– Reality: You’ll have fun. It doesn’t take huge amounts of money to build a successful retirement, and in fact, happiness doesn’t always build along with individual retirement account balances. In the JP Morgan Asset management research, the amount of increased satisfaction that a retiree gets seems to flatten once their spending tops $40,000 a year. Some 68 percent of retirees in a 2011 Consumer Reports survey said they were “highly satisfied” with their retirement lives. Reality: The best things in life are free.###1576||Empty###1577||Oh no!

by Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin, The Associated Press

DETROIT—General Motors Co. (GM) faced more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars this week as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened probes into the matter.

The United States Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter.

The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.

Representatives for the Justice Department and GM would not comment.

The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg News.

At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade.

The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths.

Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government’s road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), didn’t take action sooner.

GM announced last month it will replace ignition switches that can shut off car motors unexpectedly.

When that happens, drivers lose power-assisted steering and brakes and can lose control of the cars.

The ignition can slip from the run position to accessory or off, due partly to heavy key chains dangling from the steering column.

Also, if the ignition switch isn’t in the run position, air bags may not inflate if a crash occurs.

An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found that drivers started submitting complaints about the problem in early 2005, shortly after the first Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale.

The review of complaints about the Cobalt, GM’s top-selling small car in the mid-2000s, found 173 instances of engine stalling or air bags failing to deploy, both symptoms of the ignition problem.

Many drivers reported problems with keys sticking in the ignition in addition to the stalling.

Fred Upton of Western Michigan, the chairman of the House committee, said in a statement that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks.

Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to the NHTSA.

The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.

Upton said the committee wants to know if GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.

“If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,” Upton said.

The NHTSA has said the rate of problems in the GM cars was not significantly different from similar vehicles.

The prospect of congressional hearings means more bad publicity for GM, which is trying to distance itself from a reputation for building lousy cars.

The company has said it’s more focused on quality since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009.

“It’s the old GM haunting the new GM,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports magazine. “They have a lot of the old products still hanging around.”

Fisher said GM’s new cars and trucks will have to be better than the competition to lure back buyers who swore years ago to never again to buy a GM car.

The NHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the ignition problem.

The agency could fine GM up to US$35-million for a delayed response.

Automakers must report safety problems to the NHTSA within five days of learning about them.

GM said in a statement that it’s co-operating with the NHTSA and the House committee.

On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s from the 2005 to 2007 model years.

Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts from 2003 to 2007, and Chevrolet HHRs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007.

GM said this week it has hired attorney Anton Valukas to investigate the company’s actions before the recall.

Valukas investigated the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers for a bankruptcy court.

GM has promised an “unvarnished” investigation into the recall.###1579||This Site Is Under Construction and Coming Soon.

With help from Joanne Kenen, Jennifer Haberkorn and Brett Norman

ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL PUSHES FOR FEWER HEALTH PLAN CANCELLATIONS — An Obama administration proposed rule released late Friday would sharply limit health plan cancellations, just several months after a wave of canceled policies led to a political firestorm that put the White House on its heels. Under the rule, insurers would have broader latitude to adjust the benefits and limits in their policies without considering them canceled and replaced by new products. Instead, changes like updating co-pays and deductibles or eliminating annual limits to comply with Obamacare would constitute “modifications” to existing plans, rather than totally new offerings. “We believe these proposed standards will minimize unnecessary terminations of coverage, ensuring predictability and continuity for consumers, while reasonably providing issuers the flexibility to make necessary adjustments to coverage,” the administration wrote in the proposal. The proposed rule: http://go.cms.gov/OujxqF

Story Continued Below

--Other administration proposals released Friday:

-Insurers would be required to provide a broader network of doctors and health care providers for consumers. CMS will examine whether plans offer “reasonable access” to hospital systems, mental health services, oncology providers and primary care. http://go.cms.gov/1itPqLl

-The Obama administration would be able to identify state laws that conflict with Obamacare’s efforts to set up navigator programs in each state.

-Insurers would get a break in calculating their administrative costs to determine whether they owe customers a rebate. The law requires that insurers spend 80 percent of premium dollars on medical care, but the administration intends to “raise the ceiling.”

GOP OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT ON THE HORIZON? — House Republicans are coalescing behind an alternative to Obamacare, and it’s got a lot of familiar features: more high-risk pools, broader use of health savings accounts and empowering small businesses to band together to increase their market power. The plan, reported Sunday by The Washington Post, presents an election-year health care alternative to the health law and has been making the rounds among senior Republicans in recent days. According to the Post, the House GOP will get a briefing on the plan next month from Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers. http://wapo.st/1kVX9od

ARK. JUDGE TOSSES 12-WEEK ABORTION BAN — A federal judge in Arkansas Friday struck down the state’s law banning abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright said the law prohibited a woman’s constitutional right to elect to have an abortion before a fetus’s viability outside of the womb. The law, which banned the procedure at 12 weeks gestation except in cases of rape, incest and emergencies, was passed in March 2013 after state lawmakers overrode Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe’s veto. The ruling upheld the part of the law that requires women seeking an abortion to undergo an abdominal ultrasound.

NEW OBAMACARE POLICY INCLUDES LGBT PROTECTIONS – The Obama administration will require most health insurance plans to provide the same benefits to legally married gay couples that they do to heterosexual couples, according to a policy released today. Insurers are not required to offer family coverage under Obamacare — they can just offer individual policies — but if they do, the nondiscrimination rules will cover same-sex married couples, states guidance posted to the CMS website. The rules apply to all plans offered on the Obamacare exchanges. Under the rules, however, employers are still allowed to define who qualifies as a spousal dependent for group health plans.

BIG WEEK FOR MEDICAID EXPANSION – It could be a bellwether week for a slew of states considering Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid. Nebraska lawmakers are scheduled to vote, a year after coming just shy of corralling the filibuster-proof margin they need to advance the measure. Maine lawmakers are likely to send an expansion bill to Gov. Paul LePage’s desk for the second time, a measure he’s sure to veto again. And the New Hampshire House could take up a Senate-passed measure that embraces a private-sector version of expansion that already has the support of Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. http://politico.pro/1icoMFR

RNC CHIEF: OBAMACARE IS ‘TOTAL POISON’ – Republicans are showing no signs of shrinking from a fight over Obamacare in the fall elections. Party chair Reince Priebus called the law “complete poison” during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” and said it would be a primary target for the GOP. He also credited the Florida special election victory for Republicans to the party’s emphasis on the health law. POLITICO’s Jonathan Topaz reports: http://politi.co/1d4e3i2

HOSPICE GROUP OPPOSES CARVE-IN– National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization opposes the recent MedPAC proposal to “carve-in” hospice care in Medicare Advantage — i.e. having the MA plan take the clinical and financial responsibility for hospice. NHPCO says such a change would limit choice for patients and families. It may also cost families more, as the proposal could mean extra co-payments or cost-sharing, and it could be financially harmful for the hospices too, if they aren’t assured of getting the baseline reimbursement rate. http://bit.ly/1e9AMXT

LABOR H SPENDING – More than 1000 health and education organizations from all 50 states signed on to a letter asking appropriators to bring FY 2015 back to FY 2010 level of $163.6 billion to reverse what they called an erosion of essential services.

But with sign-ups among 18- to 34-year-olds lagging behind expectations nationally, pro-reform groups are targeting Texas — with its large, youthful population — in an effort to up their numbers.

In February, for the second consecutive month, young adults made up 27 percent of those who had successfully purchased coverage through the online insurance marketplace in Texas, compared to 25 percent of those who enrolled nationally, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.



The Obama administration has said that young adults — who are generally healthy and have fewer medical costs — should make up 40 percent of those insured through the marketplace to offset the costs of older, higher-risk patients and keep premiums down.

“The next couple of weeks are going to be instrumental,” said Sara Smith, program director for the pro-ACA Texas Public Interest Research Group, which advocates on consumer issues. “We have two weeks to inform the state’s most uninformed health care consumers.”

John Davidson, senior health care policy analyst for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that will be a futile battle, given that costs for young people under Obamacare aren't minimal.

“The ACA was sold as something that would make health care cheaper. A lot of people are going on the exchange expecting their plans to be free or very inexpensive, and that’s just not the case,” he said. “...Young, healthy people aren’t going to want to pay rates like this, especially if they don’t have to go to the doctor."

Before the implementation of the ACA, insurance companies often charged a five-to-one ratio or higher for monthly premiums based on a consumer's age, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry. The new law limits this ratio to three to one. In order to make this system work, the Obama administration has said that young adults need to enroll at high enough rates to yield a surplus in premium revenue — which insurance companies can then allocate to help cover the expected deficit created by lower premiums for older patients.

The Texas Public Interest Research Group started its campaign, Health Insurance 101, to give young adults information on their health care enrollment options. They have canvassed on Texas college campuses, hired student interns at several schools and pushed university officials and student body leaders to send out the group's information guide and email reminders about ACA deadlines.

Smith said the group is also focusing on future users of the marketplace: “Maybe they are a 24-year-old senior on their parents’ plan. They aren’t always going to be that way,” she said.

Another national pro-ACA group, Young Invincibles, was a presence at the recent South By Southwest festival in Austin, and has established enrollment stations at bars in the state's urban areas. The group also created an app called Healthy Young America that can be used to calculate premiums and find health care services.

“We rarely have young people tell us they don’t want to sign up," said José Sánchez, the group's southern regional organizing director. "It’s usually that they didn’t know about the deadline or subsidies."

Supporters of health reform are hopeful there will be a surge in sign-ups among young adults in the final days of the open enrollment period. “I’m confident that these numbers will spike before the deadline,” said Stacey Pogue, a senior health care policy analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities.

If they don't, the ACA has protective measures built in to avoid major increases in premiums for the first two years. A study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that if rates among young people stay at around 25 percent, it will not be catastrophic for the system — but insurance companies would likely increase premiums to protect their profits.

Davidson, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said he believed cost was the top impediment for young people seeking health coverage. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator, a single 25-year-old making $20,000 per year and living at 174 percent of the federal poverty line would need to pay $1,021 each year for coverage — and that's after the government subsidy.

If young people were suddenly going to start enrolling in large numbers, Davidson said, "we would have seen it by now.”

By Christine Kern, contributing writer

Over 4.2 million people via Obamacare's HIE marketplaces through March 1

Nearly 950,000 Americans selected a health insurance plan through the state and federal exchanges in February, bringing the total to over 4.2 million people who had enrolled into private plans via Obamacare's health insurance exchange marketplaces through March 1, the Department of Health and Human Services announced.

Modern Healthcare reports enrollments decreased by just over 200,000—or 18 percent—from January, when more than 1.1 million individuals enrolled in commercial plans. Yet, despite the drop, federal officials anticipate another surge as the March 31 deadline for enrollment approaches. Those who are not covered by the deadline may face a fine of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater.

According to The Huffington Post, at the current pace, sign-ups are below the original target of 5.6 million by the end of February, based on the Congressional Budget Office projection of seven million by the end of March. Last month, the budget office downgraded those projections to six million for the full six-month enrollment period, so a big surge would be needed in the final weeks to meet that benchmark.

Approximately 25 percent of enrollments up to March 1 were for individuals in the critical demographic age range of 18 to 34. They are presumed to be healthier and thus less likely to incur costly medical bills than the older people in the market. The White House originally aimed for about 40 percent of the enrollees to be younger than 35 years old.

Uncertainty also remains as to how many people have signed up for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program since open enrollment commenced Oct. 1. According to Tuesday's HHS report, 4.4 million people have signed up for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program since the beginning of the enrollment period. That number doesn't include anyone who enrolled in the programs directly with state agencies, however.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pointed to a Gallup survey released Monday that showed the percentage of uninsured individuals decreased from 17.1 to 15.9 percent, the lowest level since 2008, as evidence that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is making a difference. “This wasn't a coincidence or something that just happened on its own,” Sebelius said. “Given what we know about past enrollment patterns for healthcare, we expect that even more will sign up as we approach the March 31 deadline.”



Just over 60 percent of enrollments—or 2.6 million—were processed through the federal exchange. The rest were through the marketplaces run by 14 states and the District of Columbia.###1590||Empty###1591||Video

Colorado collected slightly more than $2 million in taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana in the month of January, according to new figures released by the state Monday.

The numbers are the first official tally of the historic January sales, themselves a nationwide first. If the figures remain at that pace, sales and tax revenues would fall below previous estimates of what Colorado could reap from the sale of marijuana.

In January, Colorado collected $1.4 million from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana, plus another $416,690 from the state's standard 2.9 percent sales tax, according to a news release Monday from the Colorado Department of Revenue. Extrapolating from those figures, recreational marijuana businesses did slightly more than $14 million in retail sales during the month.

Most of the tax revenue came from stores in Denver, and the city reported it collected $616,282 in local sales taxes from recreational marijuana sales in January. In addition, the state will share $128,586 with the city from statewide collections.

Recreational marijuana businesses paid $195,318 in excise tax during January, which will be put toward school construction.

In total, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January .

Both Gov. John Hickenlooper's budget office and legislative analysts have predicted recreational sales for the first six months of 2014 would top $190 million.

The industry's swelling ranks — plus a state rule that exempted some early marijuana transfers from excise tax — mean monthly tax totals may rise as the year goes on. Barbara Brohl, head of the state Department of Revenue, said it could be April before collections stabilize.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," she said in a statement.###1593||Empty###1594||Geopolitical uncertainty clouds view on Fed outlook: CNBC survey

CNBC.com | Tuesday, 18 Mar 2014 | 6:15 AM ET

Janet Yellen will chair her first meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee with broad agreement on Wall Street over the outlook for policy this year and a forecast for stronger U.S. growth this year and next. But the March CNBC Fed Survey finds sharp divisions over what happens to Federal Reserve policy in 2015 and a cloud of geopolitical concern hanging over the outlook.

All but one of the 41 respondents, who include economists, fund managers, and strategists, see the Fed tapering at the meeting this week, and 81 percent expect tapering at each of the remaining meetings this year.

That's up from 72 percent in January. On average, respondents see the Fed tapering by around $10 billion at each meeting. A strong 59 percent agree with the $10 billion pace of tapering, with 27 percent saying the Fed should go faster and 10 percent saying slower.

The Fed currently is purchasing $65 billion in assets every month to try and drive down interest rates and stimulate the economy. It has signaled it would reduce or taper its purchases by $10 billion at each meeting this year, which would effectively ends it purchase program by December.

(Read more: US manufacturing output posts largest gain in six months)

"The strong February jobs report gives ammo for the Fed to continue tapering its stimulus program by $10 billion a month through 2014," Robert Morgan of Fulcrum Securities wrote in response to the survey.

There are greater divisions emerging over what happens next year, however. About 60 percent see the Fed hiking interest rates in 2015 and 40 percent look for it to wait until 2016 or later. While 60 percent see the Fed maintaining its large balance sheet, now at $4.1 trillion and growing, 40 percent see the Fed reducing it, which can happen either through asset sales or by not replacing bonds that mature. Those who think the Fed reduces the size of its balance sheet in 2015, look for an average decline of $108 billion in 2015.

An overwhelming 95 percent of respondents think Yellen and the FOMC will scrap the guidance that says the Fed will consider raising interest rates once the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent, but they are unclear how the Fed fixes the problem. The rate has already declined to 6.7 percent and Yellen and other Fed officials have said that it does not tell the full story of excess slack in the labor market and the need for continued low rates.

"They will use Yellen's first press conference to move away from the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold," said Diane Swonk of Mesirow Financial.

About half of respondents think the Fed will drop a numerical target all together. A fifth of respondents think the threshold will be replaced by another number, with the average being 5.6 percent.

"Fed policy is not going to be bound by single hard numeric unemployment targets, but by the Fed's judgment of the strength of the labor markets," wrote Rod Smyth of Riverfront Investment Group.

Tony Crescenzi of Pimco called removing the threshold, together with an end to the bond-buying program, "a recipe for a steep yield curve, because longer maturities tend to bear the burden of uncertainty."

Respondents to the survey also see economics new risks on the horizon, with most of them being the foreign horizons of China and Ukraine. "The financial markets are too complacent over a tail risk that could turn into a new 'cold economic and financial war,'" wrote Allen Sinai of Decision Economics.

(Read more: Fed meets amid market skittishness)

Guy LeBas of Janney Montgomery Scott wrote that growing evidence that China and other emerging markets are slowing or even contracting is "a major impediment to global and thereby U.S. economic growth right at the time that the domestic situation is supposedly looking better."

Still, average growth is seen picking up from 2.3 percent in 2013 to 2.8 percent in 2014 and 3 percent in 2015. The weather is seen subtracting about six-tenths of a point off growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, but it will recapture four-tenths of that loss in the second quarter of this year.

Wall Street is reasonably comfortable with its outlook for Fed policy. Just a quarter say the risk is that the Fed is more hawkish than they forecast, a third say the risk is for a more dovish Fed. Forty percent say the risks are balanced. That's up from 35 percent in the January meeting, the last one chaired by Yellen's predecessor Ben Bernanke.

(Read more: Markets hang in the balance ahead of Fed decision)

In addition, 68 percent say the Fed's communication is somewhat or very clear and credible, suggesting Yellen does not have to overhaul guidance to markets beyond the problem with the unemployment threshold.

In December 2012 the boss of Pershing Square, a hedge fund, announced a $1 billion bet that Herbalife would go bust, based on his belief that the dietary-supplement firm runs an illegal pyramid-selling scheme. Since then Herbalife’s shares had crept higher, thanks not least to buying by tycoons such as Carl Icahn, George Soros and Dan Loeb. But on March 12th the share price tumbled when Herbalife announced it is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

This will raise Mr Ackman’s hopes of eventual vindication for his belief that Herbalife’s “multi-level marketing” system is in essence a shake-down of the people on the bottom layer (the company strongly denies this, and just about everything else Mr Ackman has said about it). But it will also add to the concerns of critics of Mr Ackman, who fear he is creating a new form of political power by combining two of the things the American public most hates about wealthy folk: short-selling and state-of-the-art lobbying.

Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.













His bet against Herbalife is a classic short, selling borrowed shares that will have to be repurchased later (at a lower price, Mr Ackman hopes) to return them to their owners. As for the lobbying, on March 9th the New York Times ran a long, sniffy article which tracked down people who claimed to have suffered financial losses at Herbalife’s hands and whose stories Mr Ackman has bundled up to present to Congress.

Short-selling generally does not deserve its bad rap. Often it helps to prevent damaging financial bubbles by providing a reality check on an irrationally exuberant market. Arguably, reinforcing shorting with well-executed lobbying should not make it more unacceptable, merely more effective. It is not as if the shorter has all the firepower. Mr Ackman is said to have spent over $264,000 on his Herbalife campaign, but the company’s federal-lobbying budget in 2013 was over seven times that.

Mr Ackman has talked of a moral crusade against Herbalife and promised to give away any personal profits from the trade to charity. His critics see him simply as a greedy billionaire who is now exploiting America’s newly laissez-faire attitude to political spending in pursuit of a big financial payday. There is no reason to think he has undue influence at the FTC. Even if, despite the company’s denials, Mr Ackman were to provide convincing proof that Herbalife sells snake oil to gullible immigrants, that might not demonstrate conclusively that it has acted illegally. The laws governing pyramid schemes and multi-layer marketing are notoriously fuzzy. Nor might any punishment be severe enough to close the business.

What if the FTC investigation were to find grounds to drive Herbalife into bankruptcy, as Mr Ackman hopes? Would the public treat him as a hero, who took a big risk to stop the exploitation of vulnerable people? Or would they merely view his success as evidence that he had become a “House of Cards” style billionaire with too much power in Washington?###1598||Beth Skogn Musicians in Wisconsin worked to raise awareness about Obamacare by collaborating on a song about getting health insurance.

With roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash.

Young Invincibles, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. that is focused on the economic issues affecting young adults, launched a sweepstakes last week where it is awarding a cash prize of $1,200 — enough to potentially cover a year’s worth of health insurance premiums for a young adult — to people who download their health care app or submit a card in the mail. The contest runs through the fall, but by launching it now, organizers hope young people who download the app can use it to learn more about whether they qualify for financial assistance and where they should go to sign up. “This last month is going to be a huge push for educating young adults,” says Jen Mishory, deputy director for Young Invincibles.

What’s behind these new incentives? A government report released Tuesday showed that 4.2 million people chose private insurance plans through March 1, meaning 2.8 million people would need to buy coverage this month if the Obama administration is to meet its initial goal of signing up 7 million people by the end of the enrollment period. In an analysis released Wednesday, Avalere Health, a consulting firm based in Washington, D.C., said it expects total enrollment will top out at 5.4 million by the end of the month.

Young people are particularly lagging behind in other groups in signing up. So far, 25% of those who have selected private plans are between the ages of 18 and 34. Administration officials have said repeatedly that they expect young and healthy people to put off signing up for insurance until the last minute. So groups are getting creative with their approach in the final push.

Kyle Pfister, founder of Ninjas for Health, a startup based in Milwaukee that consults for public health agencies, got local musicians talking — and singing — about the law by giving them an artistic task: write a song about the benefits of getting health insurance. After more than 10 artists gathered to sing and record a video for the song, dubbed “Sing Forward,” he engaged other local musicians by challenging them with a competition to see who could develop the best remix of the song.

Some artists rapped the lyrics, while others submitted videos of them whistling the entire song. And some sped up the song and added techno beats. Hannah Conklin, one of the winners announced Wednesday afternoon, recorded herself on Valentine’s Day singing a folk version of the song on a street corner in Asheville, N.C., where she lives now, as two people dressed in heart costumes danced alongside her. “We will sing forward, our health to yours,” the 28-year-old belted while strumming her red guitar.

Conklin, who sings by the name Hannah Rebekah, is the kind of artist Pfister is hoping to reach. She knew very little about the law when she moved back to the U.S. from Japan in September and doesn’t have insurance, but she is now talking to navigators about her options. And Anna Vogelzang, 29, the local artist who wrote the song, says many of her musician friends found less expensive insurance plans through the insurance exchanges. (She already had insurance through her husband’s job.) “We’re starting a conversation with people who wouldn’t normally be talking about this,” says Pfister, who says he has no hard numbers for how many people reached out to navigators or visited HealthCare.gov as a result of the contest.

State-based exchanges are also trying alternative approaches. DC Health Link, the exchange for Washington, D.C., promoted their new educational app at a local bar last week. The Washington Health Benefit Exchange in Washington state is partnering with roller derby groups to help spread the word. And Connect for Health Colorado held a comedy show for earlier this month in Greely that targeted young adults. Other groups are holding creative competitions and targeting specific professions. “We are trying to figure out how to get the most out of every hour,” says Rachel Klein, the enrollment program director for Families USA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit consumer advocacy group that supports the law.

Even President Obama is changing the tone of his message. In a six-minute Web video that went viral this week, the president pitched HealthCare.gov to young people during an awkward, dry and comedic interview with actor and “The Hangover” star Zach Galifianakis.

“I heard about that, that’s the thing that doesn’t work,” Galifianakis told the president during the segment, in which he also asked the president if he plans to build his presidential library in Kenya and who he rooted for during the winter Olympics.

“The point is that a lot of young people, they think they’re invincible,” the president said, to which Galifianakis replied, “Did you say invisible?” The Funny or Die video sent more than 54,000 referrals to HealthCare.gov Tuesday, and the government site received more than 890,000 visits by the end of the day, up 40% from Monday.

Supporters and government officials are also shifting the thrust of their message, moving away from emotional ploys to get people to think about how they might benefit and pointing out that they need to act right now. Enroll America, a nonprofit organization working to increase access to health insurance, is dedicating less real estate on its consumer-focused website, GetCoveredAmerica.org, to sharing success stories of people who got covered. Instead it is more prominently featuring tools that can help people figure out if they are likely to qualify for subsidies and help them find a navigator.

The group has also cut back on door-to-door canvassing and is holding mass enrollment events in churches, mosques and universities around the country. “Think about a church where you might reach a few hundred people versus door-to-door where you might reach five people in one hour,” said president Anne Filipic during an interview in their D.C. headquarters this week. She added that their education initiatives will continue well into the summer as they prepare for the next open enrollment season. “There is a lot of attention on the March 31 deadline, but we’re not shutting our doors after that.”

This decision is possibly another sign that Beijing is gradually lessening the central bank's intervention and increasing the role of market forces.



According to Richard Kelly, Head of European Rates and FX Research at TD Securities, the move “comes as little surprise beyond just the timing given the moves to clear out speculators in recent weeks.”



The string of disappointing data coming out of China recently, with a wider than estimated trade deficit are also weighing on the yuan as they “perhaps provide some fundamental rationale to give the authorities in China a credible platform to induce CNY volatility,” the RBS team of analysts suggest, adding that “they also increase the risk associated with potential excesses in the Chinese financial system.”



Nevertheless, concerns about systemic risk are not high, as it is expected that Chinese authorities have the situation under control and that they would prevent any serious fallout.



Economic data



Singapore published non-oil domestic exports (NODX) numbers on Sunday, which showed a year-on-year 9.1% increase, above consensus of a 7.1% rise. On a monthly basis the NODX grew 7.2%, beating forecasts of 2.5%.



Later today China will release its House Price data for February. In January House Prices grew by 9.6% and the housing market is expected to “benefit disproportionately from the hoped-for return to stable monetary policy,”, as “property is more sensitive than most goods and services to monetary policy,” in the opinion of Tim Condon from ING.



Technicals



The PboC's decision to widen the daily trading bans of USD/CNY will most probably weaken the yuan further in the near-term. An increased volatility is expected in CNY and CNH, but as ANZ FX strategists Khoon Goh and Irene Cheung emphasize, “it isn’t just movements in USD/CNY and USD/CNH that need to be watched.”



“There is the potential for a spillover into other Asian currencies as well. To date, the weakness in yuan has not had much of an effect on the rest of USD/Asia. But with the prospect of further yuan weakness, we could start to see a more meaningful impact on regional currencies.”



The USD/CNY fell by 0.12 yesterday hitting a low of 6.1431. The daily FXStreet Trend Index for USD/CNY was slightly bullish, with the OB/OS Index overbought. RSI was neutral at 71.0421 at the last close. Daily 2-StDev Volatility Bandwidth is shrinking at 274 pips, with ATR (14) shrinking at 126 pips.

In its IPO prospectus, High Frequency Trading firm Virtu reveals it had one losing trading day in 1,238 days of trading.

Just one.

HFT has become increasingly controversial in recent years, and this new IPO shines light on an otherwise secretive (and computerized) industry. Virtu is what's called a market maker. It doesn't hold onto securities for very long, but instead derives profit from bid/ask spreads.

High frequency trading is called "high frequency" for exactly that reason. This is all happening in a matter of milliseconds. Virtu and other HFT firms basically argue they are providing a public service by ensuring liquidity in the market "by consistently buying securities from sellers and selling securities to buyers," according to the prospectus.

Critics of HFT like ZeroHedge say that when your business model is to "scalp pennies from every market order - that would be billions of market orders in a period of four years - there is no risk."

Virtu is a New-York based firm famous for trying (and failing) to buy Knight Capital Group in 2012. But things are definitely going well for the HFT firm. Its founder and chief executive officer recently purchased the Florida Panthers hockey team.

NEW YORK - US stocks fell in early trade following disappointing economic data from China and Japan and continued tension over Ukraine.

About 30 minutes into trade on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.92 (0.29 per cent) to 16,404.80.

The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 2.09 (0.11 per cent) to 1,875.95, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.37 (0.01 per cent) lower to 4,335.85.

Weekend economic data from China raised questions about the outlook for the world's second largest economy.

Beijing reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

LONDON - Europe's main stock markets traded mixed as investors responded to China's economic data and the continued Ukraine-Russia crisis.

On the corporate front, US-based Chiquita Brands and Ireland's Fyffes Plc said they were merging in a deal that would create the world's biggest banana supplier with annual revenue of $US4.6 billion ($A5.10 billion).

London's FTSE 100 slid 0.35 per cent to 6,689.45 points while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt fell 0.91 per cent to 9,265.50 points.

However, in Paris the CAC 40 climbed 0.10 per cent compared with Friday's closing values to 4,370.84.

Madrid added 0.30 per cent and Milan rose 0.58 per cent.

A threat by Russian gas giant Gazprom to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, which is the major transit country for the rest of Europe, put the chill on stocks.

Revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected, while Beijing recorded an unexpected trade deficit of US$22.98 billion in February.

HONG KONG - Asian markets tumbled following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.

Tokyo slipped 1.01 per cent, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93 per cent, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03 per cent lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.

Shanghai dived 2.86 per cent, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75 per cent, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.

WELLINGTON - The NZX 50 Index fell 7.817 points, or about 0.2 per cent, from a record to 5117.835.###1609||Empty###1610||Confirming a preliminary ruling dating from September 2012, the Federal Constitutional Court said it saw no obstacles to Germany taking part in the €500-billion European Stability Mechanism, set up to bail out troubled countries and their banks.

Nevertheless, in the ruling, presiding judge Andreas Voßkuhle insisted that it must be "the Bundestag [lower house of parliament] which retains sole responsibility over Germany's public income and spending, even with regard to its international and European commitments."

"As before, it is a matter of finding a way out of the crisis that is sustainable, realistic and has democratic and constitutional backing," Voßkuhle said.

Throughout the eurozone turmoil since 2010, eurosceptics repeatedly asked the Constitutional Court in the south-western city of Karlsruhe to rule on whether new EU crisis-fighting tools complied with Germany's constitution.

The red-robed judges have always validated European decisions, or sent them to a European court, while reinforcing the German parliament's right to be consulted.

The treaty establishing the ESM bailout fund contained an annex detailing this provision.

Germany's share of the ESM bailout fund amounts to €190 billion, more than that of any other country. Germany was one of the last countries in the region to ratify the rescue fund, in late 2012.

There had been no suggestion the court, which Chancellor Angela Merkel has always had to take into account in her decisions on European policy, would deviate from the line it had taken so far.

In a ruling last month, the court for the first time passed a case up to the European level, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ).

At issue was the European Central Bank's OMT bond purchase programme, which eurosceptics had argued overstepped the central bank's mandate and was tantamount to printing money.

The Outright Monetary Transactions programme theoretically allows the central bank to buy up unlimited amounts of sovereign debt of crisis-ridden countries.

It was unveiled by ECB chief Mario Draghi in August 2012 and, although it has never been put into use, its mere existence largely defused fears of an imminent eurozone break-up.

Observers said the decision could be good for the euro because the ECJ as a European body was unlikely to overturn an anti-crisis measure that has been instrumental in restoring calm to the markets.

The EU Commission in Brussels welcomed the German court's move.

Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.

In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China's exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.

In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.

The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.

"It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table," said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it's) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It's going to be par for the course for this year."

The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.

The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.

The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.

"The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China," said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. "Expectations have been coming down, but the numbers have been disappointing even those reduced expectations."

Despite the disappointing data from China, some market watchers anticipate that last week's gains will continue.

The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of unusually severe winter weather, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also helped encourage investors.

"In general, I think the market will move past the poor China export numbers fairly quickly," said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. "There's still a lot of fundamental support for the S&P at this particular range."

Chalupnik also anticipates Monday's decline isn't telling of the market's trajectory for the week ahead, barring more fallout from Russia's deployment of troops in Ukraine.

"My guess is the market moves ever so slightly higher this week," he said. "The trend is still up. We really haven't seen anything to break that trend."

Monday marked the fifth anniversary of the current bull market in stocks. The S&P 500 index bottomed out on March 9, 2009, and is up about 177 percent since then. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.

This is a light week for market-moving economic data and corporate earnings. But investors will be watching the latest data on retail sales, due out Thursday, and a gauge of consumer confidence due out Friday.

"Those two sets of numbers will really tell us where the consumer is and whether or not the consumer will head out and spend when the weather warms up," Liu said.

Among the stocks bucking the slight downward turn Monday was Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

The company climbed the most of any stock in the S&P 500 index, vaulting $11.95, or 7.1 percent, to $180. The company raised its 2014 earnings forecast, saying the national health agency of France will reimburse it for past sales of its drug Soliris.

Chiquita was another gainer. It agreed to combine with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company. The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion in annual revenue. Chiquita rose $1.16, or 10.7 percent, to $12.

Southwest Airlines' stock touched a 52-week high of $23.67 early in the day before ending up 50 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.60. The carrier got a boost after it reported that passengers are flying more miles, a trend that helped send a key revenue figure higher last month.###1612||Empty###1613||Empty###1614||Empty###1615||Hours after Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers disappeared off the coast of Malaysia on 8 March, DigitalGlobe had repositioned its high-resolution satellite constellation to capture as much data as possible. On Monday, it posted those images on crowdsourcing platform Tomnod and had 60,000 page views within an hour. It did so at the bequest of the crowd, which came to DigitalGlobe within minutes of the plane being reported missing, asking when a page would launch. But DigitalGlobe is always keeping a watchful eye. "When the Nina ship went missing off the coast of Australia last year, we got involved after the crew had been missing for two months," Luke Barrington, Senior Manager of Geospatial Big Data at DigitalGlobe tells Wired.co.uk. "Bad things happen in the world, then people would call DigitalGlobe some time later. This week, five minutes after the news of the Malaysia incident I was getting text messages and emails."

DigitalGlobe's constellation of five satellites, which scope the world at a rate of 75 laps a day between them, has been harnessed for humanitarian reasons in the past. It has been used to track the movements of the Lord's Resistance Army across swathes of land in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, in order to predict and scupper their next attacks. But more and more, its capabilities are being called upon in emergent situations. Last year it posted images covering thousands of square kilometres to help in the hunt for a light aircraft crash in Idaho. "We were able to prioritise the search in the field to tell them where not to go. Then they flew over with a GoPro camera hanging out, and looked over footage when they got back to find one little sign of wreckage." In that instance, the team was hunting for a glimpse of a white plane, in snow-covered mountains. Today, the search is not much easier. To help, as with the Idaho crash, DigitalGlobe has already posted satellite images to a Tomnod crowdsourcing page where every pixel covers 50cm of land space -- or in this case, water. Nasa's Landsat, in contrast, captures around 30 metres per pixel. "The jet might occupy one pixel in that image," says Barrington.

The former Tomnod employee explains he had unofficial requests right after news emerged from the US government and even insurance companies, all asking when the crowdsourcing platform would go live. The latter, he says, want to know whether the incident was terror-related, or a crash. "At least we're getting involved sooner," Barrington tells us.

For DigitalGlobe though, the operation starts as soon as the news hits the wires. The First Look team is tasked with reading tweets and scouring the wires 24/7 for emergent situations just like this. "If you know you want to monitor a particular uranium site in the Middle East you might request imagery all the time -- but there's no analysts on staff at the US government whose job it is to look for a Malaysian plane."

First Look members make on the fly decisions about where their satellites might be needed and start programming them into position. For something like an earthquake, that might mean downloading data from before the incident, so search and rescue has a comparison. With the Malaysia incident it meant making inferences from the news to position the constellation correctly.

WorldView-2 satellite DigitalGlobe

Each satellite already circles the Earth from the north to the south pole, taking 90 minutes to do one lap at heights of around 400 to 700km above Earth. "They stay in a Sun-synchronised orbit," explains Barrington, "staying in line with a point on surface of the Earth where its roughly 10.30am so we know we'll get sunlight and not too many shadows." Each can be skewed up to 45 degrees to gain more scope and capture a few different time zones. When an analyst makes a decision about the ground/water they need to cover, the closest satellite moves into position. This week, two have been moved.

Shortly after news of the missing airline got out, rumours flooded the networks that an oil slick had been spotted in the Gulf of Thailand that could be jet fuel, and Landsat data also pointed the team there. At 10.30am on Sunday, two shots were taken to the the north east of the Malaysian peninsula off the coast. Those images have been loaded to Tomnod, but it looks as though the fuel was from ships, so the satellites have been moved closer to the southern tip of Cambodia.

Like the Idaho plane crash, we are looking for a needle in a haystack today. "Getting through all those pixels is difficult, and we're looking for a feature that isn't specifically defined. I imagine at this stage -- and I hope we're wrong -- it's not going to look like regular plane. This is why we ask for the public's help."

Barrington says 100 people contacted him within minutes of the incident to ask when they could help. The Tomnod community is a loyal one, and is used to scouring through mundane images of landmass, snow or water to hunt for that one indistinguishable scrap of pixel that holds the answer. "They can click on the map just like when using Google Maps, then go on to the next area and try and see as many pixels as possible. We have hundreds or thousands doing this all in real time. "But it's incredibly difficult, differentiating between clouds, waves and wreckage to find those one or two points which will be valuable. You'd be surprised how many clouds look like ships. We use a set of algorithms to rank the crowd and see where people are agreeing -- if 99 out of 100 people are all clicking on this one funny little pixel right here, for instance. The algorithm sifts through that data to see who is reliable and who is not, so maybe shouldn't be trusted as much. Then those pixels get reviewed by our analysts and sent out to people searching."

The team is continually adding to the image set on Tomnod, ensuring each is covered five times or more. "We keep on going until we're done, or we find something."

Once the crowd gets going though, as it already has, Barrington says it could take minutes or hours to go through 1,000sq km strips like the ones already loaded.

For the missing Nina ship, more than 100 images of that scale were searched and dissected by the crowdsourcing community. For those onboard, however, it was unfortunately much too late. The search got underway as a last resort, when all other avenues had come up empty. But as the public, and governments, become more and more used to calling on the expertise of private companies with resources like DigitalGlobe, the gap begins to close between when an emergency strikes and when satellites are called to action.

Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and ranking member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said the plan borrows from a number of bipartisan ideas.

"There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term, and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy," Johnson said.

The plan calls for the eventual elimination of the two federal mortgage purchasers, and preservation of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, initiatives designed to reduce the government's role in the mortgage market, the Washington newspaper the Hill reported Tuesday.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were put under government control during the 2008 economic crisis.

The proposed bill calls for transferring certain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac functions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Hill added.###1617||China's e-commerce giant Alibaba has reportedly confirmed that it will make its IPO debut in the US to reach the valuation of 130 billion dollars.

The company said that a US IPO would make it a more global company and enhance the company's transparency.

According to Cnet, Alibaba, which controls nearly 80 percent of China's Internet shopping market, is expected to raise more than 15 billion dollars, which would directly challenge Facebook's record Internet IPO, which raised 16 billion dollars in 2012.

Alibaba provides marketplace platforms and provides listing and advertising services that allow merchants to sell goods directly to consumers.

The report said that Alibaba's public debut could be seen as a boon for Yahoo, which still owns 24 percent of the e-commerce giant.

It is not confirmed on which US stock exchange Alibaba would list.###1618||Janet Yellen takes center stage in the week ahead, chairing her first FOMC meeting amid market skittishness over events in Ukraine.

There is little doubt the Fed will continue to move forward and announce another USD 10 billion "taper" of its bond-buying program, taking it to USD 55 billion a month.

The Fed is widely expected to take a knife to some of the language in its statement that set an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent as a level to cut rates.

"This is all about her. It's her first meeting. It just doesn't seem like the meeting where there's going to be a lot of policy fireworks given it might be prudent to let things coast through again, while they all get on the same page," said George Goncalves, Treasury strategist at Nomura Americas.

The Fed's target of 6.5 percent for unemployment is seen by the markets as outdated and confusing, since unemployment is now at 6.7 percent. Fed officials have also called it obsolete. The Fed will also release new economic forecasts, and any talk about the economy is likely to suggest that the weather may be a major factor behind recent weak data.

(Read more: Why this is the one number to watch in week ahead)

Goncalves does not expect the Fed to make moves based on Ukraine, unless markets deteriorate rapidly. "The Fed's in a tough predicament because they can't seem like they're reaciting. They demonstrated once before when we had the fallout in January, they were unwaivering. They did the taper," he said.

While stocks sold off in the past week, buyers sought safety in bonds, sending the 10-year yield to 2.65 percent. The Dow was down 2.4 percent to 16,065 and the S&P was off nearly 2 percent to 1,841, in the worst weekly performance since January.

(Read more: Battered market limps to end of ugly week)

The Fed's success at altering its forward guidance will ultimately show up in the yield curve, Goncalves said. "The flattening of the curve could be the risk next week. 10s (10-year notes) and 30s (30-year bonds) maybe can go up a little bit in rates, but fives (5-year notes) can go up more if they don't seem like they made more progress on the forward guidance," he said.

The two-day Fed meeting ends Wednesday with a presser by Yellen, also her first.

Markets are expected to remain on edge going into the coming week, after Sunday's referendum in Crimea on whether to join Russia or stay with Ukraine. Tense talks between the US and Russia ended Friday with no clear resolution on whether Russia would recognize the vote and the West would impose sanctions.

"I think anxieties are going to be running high. The Crimea vote is a foregone conclusion, but how does the West respond? How does Russia respond?" said Marc Chandler, chief Treasury strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.

—By CNBC's Patti Domm. Follow her on Twitter @pattidomm.###1619||Hackers this weekend targeted the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the bankrupt Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, posting information online that they claim proves Karpeles is actually hoarding bitcoins he claims were stolen.

The hackers charge that some of the nearly half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency lost in recent cyberattacks is actually still in the French CEO's possession.

"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," the unnamed group wrote, according to Forbes, a reference to the downtime and other glitches that have plagued Mt. Gox.

The hackers initially posted to Karpeles's website a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers; it included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, the company's balance in 18 currencies (including bitcoin), administrative access to Gox parent company Tibanne Limited, and a screenshot of the hackers' access, as well as a list of Karpeles's home addresses and personal resume.

An abridged version, which features Mt. Gox's balances, was later posted online, with a link to the entire set of data.

"This release would have been sooner, but in the spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data," the hackers wrote on Pastebin, advising readers to "repost and share this info before it's gone."

Karpeles's website is currently offline, and the original Reddit post has since been deleted.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan late last month, saying it lost 750,000 bitcoins, or about $480 million7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. An attack on the company's computer systems also cost Gox about 100,000 of its own units.

The filing came days after the exchange mysteriously went offline, halting trades of the cryptocurrency.

Last month, meanwhile, bitcoins valued at approximately $2.7 million went missing from Silk Road 2, allegedly due to a hack. Silk Road 2 is the reincarnation of the original Silk Road, an online black market for all things criminal that was shut down by the feds last year. The new site emerged in November and is only accessible to those who have an invite and sign in using the Tor anonymizing service.

Bitcoin has been a popular topic of late. Last week, Newsweek said it had uncovered the creator of bitcoin, a 64-year-old California man named Satoshi Nakamoto. But has denied any involvement.

The analysis by the health policy group provides a first glimpse at the shifts in the competitive landscape in New York and six other states that have released insurer-specific enrollment data.

The analysis shows New York's individual insurance market today is significantly more competitive today than it was in 2012 before the state created a health insurance exchange as part of Obamacare. It gauged competitiveness by looking at the market share of the largest insurer, the number of insurers with at least 5 percent market shares and how evenly market share is distributed across insurers.



New York's exchange market is the most competitive of the seven states analyzed.

Market shares of some of the biggest insurers offering individual health policies on the N.Y. health insurance exchange Wellpoint (Empire BlueCross BlueShield): 18 percent

Health Republic: 16 percent

Fidelis Care: 14 percent

Emblem Health: 12 percent

MVP Health Care: 10 percent

MetroPlus Health Plan: 11 percent

Excellus BlueCross BlueShield: 6 percent

United Health: 2 percent

Other insurers: 11 percent



Sixteen companies are offering individual health insurance policies through the exchange. Seven of them have market shares greater than 5 percent. Of the 16 companies participating in the exchange, 11 offered individual coverage in the state before Obamacare.

Wellpoint, which includes Empire BlueCross BlueShield, is New York's biggest player in the individual insurance market. It controlled 28 percent of the market in 2012. Its market share is now 18 percent.

Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, the dominant insurer in Central New York, controlled 15 percent of the state's individual market in 2012. Its market share has declined to 6 percent.

UnitedHealth had a 20 percent market share in 2012. Its market share has dwindled to 2 percent, because its prices are relatively high compared to competitors, according to the report.

Health Republic, a new insurer started by the Freelancers Union that offers some of the lowest rates in the state, has captured 16 percent of the market.

Several smaller insurers have picked up market share. MVP Health Care, for example, has seen its market share grow to 10 percent, up from 2 percent before the advent of the health insurance exchange.

Or at least, it might be starting. The company is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, and while it’s putting on a brave face publicly, management cannot be happy with these latest developments. As I write this the stock is down about 8% on the day. Bill Ackman, who has claimed the company is an illegal pyramid scheme that will eventually be shut down, has to like what he is seeing.

Last month, when Herbalife announced its new convertible bond, I discussed some of the implications of the deal. In some respects the bond appeared designed to squeeze short-sellers by creating a new group of investors potentially willing to pay to borrow the stock. But since Herbalife made arrangements, essentially, to lend phantom stock to hedge funds, the deal did not (at least initially) create any type of squeeze.

I did note, however, that one of the central tenets of convertible investing—that a bond holds its value reasonably well even when the underlying stock gets beaten up—might not apply to Herbalife. Part of the problem, as one of the smartest convertible guys I know said, is that Herbalife’s volatility might be “existential”—in other words, there’s concern that the issue leading to the stock’s sharp decline could conceivably destroy the company. This is what we call “bad volatility.” Good volatility applies exclusively to a stock’s valuation, but not to its legitimacy as a going concern.

Other issues with Herbalife are the company’s debt load, which while seemingly manageable now could become highly problematic with a major stock decline, and some of the potential complications with borrowing the stock for hedgers. If short-sellers pile on a falling Herbalife stock—something they have been known to do—convertible hedgers will become increasingly dependent on the phantom stock, or borrow facility, arranged by the company. Those hedgers unwilling to take this risk are likely to take their lumps and sell the bonds, accepting a certain moderate loss instead of exposing themselves to a potentially much larger one if the borrow facility should come unglued.

Early indications show that the convertible market is indeed worried about how this may play out. Herbalife’s convertibles are looking for their new level with the stock hovering around 60 (about an 8% decline on the day). The bonds were quoted in the mid-80’s when the stock was down around $57, though it subsequently bounced back to around $60 and lifted the bond quote a couple of points. As I write this the stock is slightly above 60 and the bonds would probably be quoted, for an educated guess, around the 87-88 level.

This isn’t good. The bonds were originally priced at 100 with the stock at 69.02. So the stock is down about 13% and—guess what—so, it appears, are the bonds. Convertibles are supposed to do a lot better than this, although, in fairness, you can’t completely indict a bond off short-term performance. Still, an investor would typically hope that a convertible in this situation would only fall by about half the percentage of the stock, which would have had the bonds around 93-94 instead of 87-88.

One view is that most of the bonds were originally sold to hedge funds, which were enticed to buy both by the borrow facility and by a belief that the $1 billion deal would become a convertible index benchmark issue. If the bond were to be included in the major convertible indices, outright (unhedged) buyers whose performance is measured versus those indices would essentially be forced to buy, despite their discomfort with the credit. But apparently the index inclusion has not taken place, and nervous hedge funds are now scrambling to get out.

For institutional investors who believe in the Herbalife story (another problem with the bond is that, like many newly issued convertibles, it is a private placement that will not become available to most individual investors for a year or so, unless they own the bond through a mutual fund), the convertible sell-off may be an opportunity to play the name on more attractive terms. But for now few investors appear interested. To be continued.###1626||Market players on Monday said that Vodafone’s €7.2bn acquisition of Spanish cable operator Ono would likely be credit positive for both, and could even lead to rating upgrades for the latter.

Several sources said that Ono, rated B1/B+ by Moody’s and S&P, would likely benefit from greater market access thanks to consolidation in its home market, giving it the chance to even challenge players like Telefonica.

“I think it is very likely that Ono will be upgraded on the back of this,” one London-based investor said, echoing a note published by Fitch back in January that said an acquisition of Ono by Vodafone – or even Liberty Global – would skew competition in Ono’s favour.

Others pointed to Vodafone’s acquisition of Kabel Deutschland in October last year, which saw KD’s ratings upped to Baa2/BBB+ from Ba2/BB. Vodafone is currently A3/A-.

By mid-morning, though, neither Vodafone’s nor Ono’s credit curves had moved significantly, with market players saying that the news had likely been priced in following months of rumours.

Vodafone’s senior curve was basically unchanged, bid between 0.6bp tighter and 0.4bp wider, according to Tradeweb, while its CDS was also flat at 60bp.

Sources said that Ono’s bonds were unmoved too. Shares in Vodafone were quoted around 1% higher. Ono is not listed.

The acquisition will mark Vodafone’s third purchase of a European fixed-broadband asset in two years, allowing it to offer an increasing range of services and offload some of its mobile traffic on to Ono’s cable network, Reuters said.

The deal will be funded using the proceeds of Vodafone’s USD130bn sale of Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications agreed last year.

The €7.2bn price tag implies a multiple of 10.4 times the target’s operating free cash flow, broadly in line with recent deals in the European cable and telecoms sector.###1627||The Affordable Care Act enables primary health care, which in turn promotes education about healthy lifestyle choices.

HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Monday, tracking mainland losses as the mainland's weaker-than- expected export data in February fueled worries over its economic growth.

The benchmark Hang Seng index fell 395.56 points, or 1.75 percent, to close at 22,264.93, after trading between 22,388 and 22,206. Turnover totaled 62.01 billion HK dollars (7.99 billion U. S. dollars).

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 172.64 points, or 1. 78 percent, to close at 9,536.85.

All the four sub-indices lost ground. The Commerce & Industry sub-index lost 2.3 percent; the Properties moved down 1.69 percent; the Finance lowered 1.34 percent; the Utilities dipped 0.76 percent.

Banking giant HSBC, which accounts for the largest weighting of the Hang Seng Index, edged down 1.05 percent to 80.45 HK dollars. Its local unit Hang Seng Bank closed down 0.66 percent at 121.40 HK dollars. Bank of East Asia, another Hong Kong's major bank, fell 0.33 percent to 30.6 HK dollars. Local bourse operator HKEX edged down 0.42 percent to 119 HK dollars.

Local developers fell across the board. Hang Lung Properties ended 2.12 percent lower at 20.8 HK dollars. Henderson Land, another major developer in Hong Kong, shed 3.21 percent to 42.2 HK dollars. Cheung Kong Holding, a powerful HK-based developer controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing, lost 1.19 percent to 124.8 HK dollars.

Most of analysts' and investors' attention will likely center on the drama-filled merger/buyout of Jos. A. Bank (UNKNOWN:JOSB.DL), but investors should keep their excitement in check and focus on the fundamentals and operating performance. Now that Men's Wearhouse is pushing further from its large-format store chain K&G, long a drag on earnings, shareholders should get an idea of how the better parts of the business are running, such as the tuxedo rentals and recent brand acquisitions.

The big news

Media and analysts are intently focused on any updates regarding Men's Wearhouse's just announced purchase of its next biggest competitor, Jos. A. Bank, for $1.8 billion. This mornings announcement came on the heels of the first encouraging news investors had heard since the two companies began exchanging offers. The last update came March 3, when both companies announced they had entered into a non-disclosure agreement exchanging confidential business information and a draft merger agreement.

Men's Wearhouse will be paying the aforementioned $1.8 billion for Jos A Bank, giving the company a per-share value of $65. Clearly, Jos A Bank's move to acquire Eddie Bauer convinced Men's Wearhouse to up their own bid and seal the deal.

While this is the most intriguing story to do with either company, investors should closely watch the actual business.

Things to watch

In recent periods, Men's Wearhouse showed some weakness in its industry-leading tuxedo business-- traditionally a great performer with high margins and great free cash flow. It's an important and potentially lucrative segment for Men's Wearhouse as the tuxedo rental business remains largely fractured between corporate giants and independent shops. The bread-and-butter men's suit segment is a much less appealing business with very little growth prospects. In order for Men's Wearhouse to materially grow its sales and earnings from the segment, it needs to take market share from competitors bigger (think Macy's) and smaller (Jos. A. Bank).

In terms of what to expect on the numbers, keep in mind that Men's Wearhouse has always had weakness in its fourth quarter and typically posts a loss. On the other hand,peer men's apparel retailers have had better-than-expected results. As mentioned by fellow Fool Rich Duprey, both J.C. Penney and Macy's specifically cited men's dress apparel as a bright spot in earnings. Regardless of where exactly earnings come in, investors need to remain vigilant to the operations and not solely the headline-generating stories.

Full-year 2014 guidance will be especially insightful as Men's Wearhouse trades at a rather hefty 20 times forward earnings ratio. For a business that is only modestly growing store level sales and earnings, the ratio implies the market's confidence in the merger. That bet, until there is ink on the paper, is purely speculative.

It's been a rough and tumble 12 months for Men's Wearhouse, and the coming periods will be just as exciting. Just make sure to make your investment decision on the underlying business and not purely the hype. What is now the nation's juggernaut suit seller and tuxedo rental business, Men's Wearhouse has more work to do yet.###1631||Empty###1632||Empty###1633||Why did this happen?

The amount is more than triple the estimated 10-year payments calculated last year in the White House budget proposal, driven by the companies’ increased profitability.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under federal conservatorship since 2008, when regulators agreed to inject capital into the companies to keep them afloat.

They received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds, but they have returned to profitability and by the end of March they will have had paid $202.9 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury.

No one expected them to become profitable again so quickly, but when home prices surged in 2012, they were able to recover more money than expected on soured loans.

The profit projections come in an addendum to President Barack Obama’s fiscal 2015 budget proposal. In a budget proposal last year, the administration estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would send the Treasury $51 billion through 2023.

Under a 2012 revamp of their bailout terms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac send a majority of their profits to the Treasury as dividends, and they are unable to repurchase the controlling share the government took when it bailed them out. Previously, they were required to pay only a 10 percent dividend on their bailout funds in profitable quarters.

Shareholders, including Perry Capital and Fairholme Capital Management, have sued the United States over the changes. They argue that since the companies are returning profits to taxpayers, the government’s stake should shrink.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration want to wind down and replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Source: reuters.com###1635||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Gold futures rallied on Wednesday to mark their highest settlement since September, buoyed by tensions in Ukraine and a pullback for the equities markets linked to concerns over a slowdown in China’s economy.

Worries over China have also sent prices for copper sharply lower over the past three trading sessions, with prices holding below $3 a pound.

Several factors are driving demand for gold, said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Those include military developments by Russia in Ukraine and Crimea’s referendum vote Sunday, emerging-market currency weakness and a “higher degree of ancillary geopolitical concerns stemming from uncertainty surrounding Syria and Iran.”

All of these issues, except for the Sunday referendum, are “longer-term trends that are likely to keep a bid under gold for the foreseeable future,” said Russell.

Gold for April delivery US:GCJ4 rose another $23.80, or 1.8%, to settle at $1,370.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its third-straight session climb. Prices for a most-active contract haven’t closed at levels this high since Sept. 9, FactSet data show. May silver US:SIK4 also jumped 54 cents, or 2.6%, to $21.36 an ounce.

True safe-haven demand has taken root with “no way out or to back down at the present time,” said Jeffrey Wright, managing director at H.C. Wainwright. “The end result is higher gold. Gold while trending upward has set a new support level around $1,300.”

There is a clear “standoff and no sign of an end game on either side with the Ukrainian crisis,” he said, adding that the Group of Seven leaders have sent a joint communiqué to Russian President Vladimir Putin to not annex the Crimea region into Russia, regardless of the outcome of the planned referendum on Sunday.”

Data from China over the past weekend, meanwhile, showed a much weaker-than-expected monthly decline in Chinese exports, raising concerns over the nation’s economy.

With all of that in the backdrop, global equities traded broadly lower on Wednesday, with U.S. stocks mostly lower Wednesday afternoon.

Metals-mining shares followed gold prices higher, with the Philadephia Gold and Silver Index XAU, -0.11% up 2.3%. The SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.09% rose 1.4%.

On Tuesday, gold scored its second-straight advance as worries over Russia’s standoff in Ukraine and fears of a slowdown in China continued to draw buyers to the perceived safety of the precious metal.

“Open interest in gold futures and options has jumped, and price action says this new hot money is all bullish,” said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault. “But the market doesn’t look over-stretched yet. The [speculative] net long position almost tripled between New Year’s and last week.” A long position is essentially a bet that prices will go higher.

Copper in the spotlight

Copper has been in focus this week due to its abysmal performance of late.

The commodity is by far the worst performer among all precious and base metals, with a drop of roughly 13% this year. Copper’s troubles have come amid fears of a slowing Chinese economy — and hence slowing demand for the commodity. There are also fears of credit risks in the country and that financing via warehouse-stored copper in China could collapse. Also see: Iron-ore price decline may slow as banks take control

Copper prices basically collapsed on Tuesday afternoon, closing down 2.6% to $2.95 a pound, the lowest level seen since July 2010. That level was been taken out early Wednesday on electronic trading, touching a low of $2.91.

High-grade copper for May delivery US:HGK4 US:HGK4 closed up a penny, or 0.3%, at $2.96 a pound Wednesday.

But on the Shanghai Futures Exchange overnight, the most-traded copper contract hit its lowest level in more than four years, and in London, the copper benchmark hit its lowest level in more than three years, according to media reports.

Analysts at Commerzbank explained that copper in London dipped below the $6,600 per ton threshold and below the $3 per pound market in New York simultaneously, with the two feeding off each other.

Barclays believes the worst is likely over, or at least close to it, while Commerzbank also says the slump is excessive. “What is more, the price does not reflect the current supply-demand situation on the global copper market — it is very tight, as the International Copper Study Group will doubtless confirm in the next few weeks,” said Commerzbank in a note.

Elsewhere in metals trading, April platinum US:PLJ4 rose $11.70, or 0.8%, to $1,476.30 an ounce, while June palladium US:PAM4 tacked on $6.65, or 0.9%, to $777.15 an ounce.

"The parliamentary factions are meeting. There is a consensus on bringing down the government. We are going to put it to the vote shortly," MP Suad Gannur told AFP.

"The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," she added.

Zeidan's government has been repeatedly criticised for its failure to rein in the myriad of former rebel militias which have carved out their own fiefdoms since the NATO-backed uprising that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.

The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital last October.

But in a new humiliation for his government, a North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in the east slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea earlier Tuesday.

The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

Zeidan's government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

Zeidan, an independent elected with the support of liberals, has been the target of previous no-confidence motions in the General National Congress but they have never achieved the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members.

Zeidan accuses his Islamist opponents of seeking to oust him solely to replace him with their own candidate.

It is a very legitimate question, and the answer is simply “less than you might think.” News broke on Monday that Chiquita Brands International Inc. (NYSE: CQB) is merging with Fyffes PLC.

The news might not sound like much on the surface, but this goes beyond bananas. It also goes beyond borders. Both of the boards of directors unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement.

As far as how this will work out, Chiquita will combine with Fyffes in a stock-for-stock transaction that gives Chiquita’s shareholders an ownership stake of 50.7% of the new company, which will be named ChiquitaFyffes.

Monday’s statement said, “The agreement creates a global banana and other fresh produce company with approximately $4.6 billion in annual revenues. Chiquita and Fyffes plan to complete the transaction before the end of 2014.”

Here are some of the details of a post-merger review:

The NewCo will have a combined equity value of approximately $1.07 billion, and it will be the number one banana company globally. The move also expands its branding in packaged salads, as well as in melons and pineapples. There is a tax angle here as well — The combined ChiquitaFyffes plc will continue to be Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but the NewCo will be domiciled in Ireland. It is also targeting $40 million in pre-tax cost synergies by the end of 2016.

Ed Lonergan, CEO of the current Chiquita Brands, will serve as chairman. David McCann, Fyffe’s executive chairman, will become CEO of the combined company. Monday’s release also confirmed that ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and will employ close to 32,000 people around the world.

The new company is projected to have an aggregate EBITDA in 2013 of approximately $214 million on a pro forma basis, with a pro forma combined synergy adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 2.7 times. It will also have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.

Chiquita Brands saw its shares rise 12% to $12.15, against a 52-week range of $6.04 to $13.68. Fyffes saw its shares up more than 40% in London trading and in Dublin trading. Any time you see both companies trading handily higher after merger news, it generally means that they are viewed as being “pro-investor.”

Chiquita’s $573 million seems low for being the top global banana brand in the world, particularly when you add in the Fresh Express salad brands along with its other products. Maybe this is just how the math works out, but an empire of this size would just seem to be worth more on the surface when you consider the might of the world’s food companies and how many billionaires and private equity giants are out there right now.###1641||Collapsed bitcoin exchange MtGox has provided a balance confirmation service on its website, allowing users to log in and confirm how much the exchange owes them.

Possible Hoax?

After the service launch by MtGox, a reddit account purportedly run by one of the exchange's former support agents said its server has been compromised and the login option on the website is a scam to steal passwords.

"DO NOT LOG IN PLEASE. ffs this is getting ridiculous, I have been notified that the server hosting MtGox has been compromised, if you have logged in they now have your account password, not sure what they could do with it at this point but the malicious intent is obvious.

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company”s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don”t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn”t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there”s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke noted. Since she works at a drive-thru location, for instance, she noted that tips go down when it”s cold out and people are less likely to reach out to put money in the secured tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30 years old, said she thinks mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she noted that she doesn”t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It”s a way of claiming workers make more than you”re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn”t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they”ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.###1654||Empty###1655||Empty###1656||A legal dispute is brewing between the city of Los Angeles and Time Warner Cable, which the city attorney claims failed to pay nearly $10 million in public access fees. Gordon Tokumatsu reports from Chatsworth for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on Friday, March 14, 2014. (Published Friday, March 14, 2014)

Cable provider Time Warner owes the city almost $10 million in franchise fees for the years 2008-11, the Los Angeles City Attorney charged in a federal lawsuit.

Time Warner, which makes billions of dollars in the Los Angeles market, is “stiffing” the city by not turning over the funds in 2011, City Attorney Mike Feuer said.

The fees would have funded police officers and sidewalk repairs, he said.

Slower Internet, Higher Prices Feared in Cable Takeover

Comcast's proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable has some analysts and costumers fearing the future of the U.S. cable landscape. Ted Chin reports from Santa Monica for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2014. (Published Thursday, Feb. 13, 2014)

Time Warner officials denied any wrongdoing.

“As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen in the city of Los Angeles,” according to a company statement. “We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit.

“It will now be resolved through the legal process.”

Time Warner is required to pay the city a franchise fee to install cable wires and boxes under city streets, on telephone poles and elsewhere in the “public-right-of-way,” Feuer said.

The cable provider was also required until 2009 to pay a fee toward providing public, governmental and education television programming, including allowing the public use of its studios, Feuer said.

Time Warner has refused to pay $9.7 million in franchise and other fees owed from 2008 until 2011, despite attempts to resolve the dispute “amicably,” Feuer said.

The investors, including retirement systems, have formally put Pimco on "watch lists," a signal that they will keep a much closer eye its performance than usual. It could eventually lead to reductions in the amount of money they allocate to funds at the firm, whose full name is Pacific Investment Management Co and which has $1.91 trillion in assets.

"We intend to go out and meet with them over the course of the next month," said David Hunter, chief investment officer of the North Dakota State Investment Board. The board, which has about $400 million invested with Pimco, put the fund on its watch list on February 28.

Hunter said the board could ultimately decide not to make any changes to its allocation.

The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, said it had not placed Pimco on a formal watch list, but it was also paying close attention to developments.

"CalPERS staff has tremendous respect for the staff at Pimco," the system said in an emailed statement. "That being said, we are monitoring the issue and will keep our board aware of the changes."

In a statement, Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge said: "We are focused on communication with our clients, and have been in regular contact with them following the recent leadership transition. They understand the changes we have taken and why, and are ready to move forward with us."

In a Tweet on Monday, Gross wrote, "No distractions here - just long term performance satisfaction - working hard as always for clients."

The closer scrutiny by state and local pension systems shows that Gross, though, may have more work to do to assuage investor concerns after El-Erian's surprise departure and reports of growing discord between the two men amid weak fund performance.

Overall, customers withdrew $41.1 billion from Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund last year, a record amount for the manager, according to investment research firm Morningstar. The fund posted another $1.6 billion in outflows in February, reducing assets to $236 billion and marking the 10th straight month of outflows.

The Total Return Fund, which Gross manages, trailed more than 70 percent of its peers in February.

Last month, a Wall Street Journal article described the worsening relationship between the two men as Pimco's performance deteriorated. Later, Gross told Reuters that El-Erian, who is due to leave the firm in less than a week, was trying to "undermine" him by talking to the Journal.

A memo from investment consultant NEPC to the City of Fresno Retirement System Joint Boards noted "an elevated level of concern" around the changes at Pimco.

During a recent on-site visit to the bond firm's offices, "it was clear that there was a profound sense of disappointment and surprise within Pimco regarding Mr. El-Erian's departure," the memo said, adding: "Mr. Gross viewed Mr. El-Erian as his successor and during the meeting he expressed a level of sadness and frustration regarding the resignation."

The Fresno systems were already weighing investing with Pimco when news of El-Erian's departure, as well as other staff changes, came out. When the city wanted reassurance on organizational questions, Pimco sent a team to the Fresno offices.

The Fresno systems are now negotiating with Pimco and expect to invest money with the firm in coming months.

"You're talking a lot of depth (of the bench). It's not driven by two people," said Stanley McDivitt, the systems' retirement administrator.

Other investors said they were not in a rush to make changes to their allocations.

The Florida State Board of Administration spokesman Dennis MacKee said it placed Pimco on its watch list as a routine procedure, which it followed for any firm that was undergoing management shifts.

The Florida board has about $1.7 billion in its pension fund at Pimco and about $240 million from its defined contribution plan with the firm.

"We think of our watch list as just enhanced oversight. You look a little deeper," MacKee said.

Neil Rue, a managing director at Pension Consulting Alliance, said it was too early to make any decisions about how these changes might affect Pimco's performance.

"On the fixed income front, we told our clients don't take any major action, but we need to watch this closely," Rue said.

If Pimco's style remains consistent, given Gross' strong track record over many years, there may be no changes recommended, Rue added.

R. T. Jones Capital Equities Management Inc Chief Investment Officer Steve Davis said his fund pulled out $100 million from Pimco Total Return Fund last year because of a desire to reduce duration exposure and interest rate risk, but he would consider returning to the bond giant in the future.

"Nor do we think the internal turmoil will negatively affect the performance of the fund. In fact, we don't rule out using the fund again in the future," Davis said. "We have very high respect for Bill Gross and his team at Pimco."

Bruce Berkowitz raised an intriguing issue in one of our conversations concerning Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC). Mr. Berkowitz indicated that the receivable inherent in the GSEs mortgage put-back requests should be shown on the balance sheets of both companies. I agree.

By failing to show what the companies might gain if their demands for mortgage put backs are met, Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) are understating both their earnings and current book values. Roger Puerto of Fairholme put together the tables on this and the following pages in answer to the question as to what that receivable might be. First, this is what has been paid:

Second, this is what is expected to be paid if the banks that have been assessed actually pay 10% to 12% of the notional assessment:

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s payments demands

Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) have demanded payments from 13 additional banks. The notional amount requested is $134.3 billion. If one assumes that the GSEs will recapture 12% of the amounts noted, the receivable in question is $16.1 billion. However, the GSEs are expected to seek much more money from a broader list of banks.

Accounting rules suggest that the potential recoveries may be indicated since Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) have already recovered $8.3 billion from these requests.

The Missing Receivable###1662||Despite the boom seen in the fastfood business industry, Sbarro counts itself as one of the few who were unable to capitalize on the growth trend. According to a Forbes newsmagazine report, the fastfood restaurant chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in less than three years the company had filed for the first time. The company also showed trouble brewing this year when it announced on February that it will be shuttering 155 of its 400 restaurants across North America. Forbes said that the bankruptcy news will not affect the the 600 stores owned by franchisees.

Restaurant consultant and president Michael Whiteman of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York said that the latest development at the pizza chain was inevitable. He told Reuters, "Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model. Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order. I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term. The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing."

Founded by Italian immigrants Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro in 1956, Forbes said the company grew to a 799-store firm across 40 countries and employs over 2,700 people. Majority of its stores in the US are located in malls, where it has been observed that foot traffic and food court spending has slowed down.

In its court filing, Sbarro reported $175.4 million in assets and $165.2 million in liabilities, Reuters said. The pizza chain plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization, and has tapped advisers, which include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help them with the process.

Chief Executive David Karam had said about the bankruptcy filing, "The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step."

The news agency said that Sbarro filed for bankruptcy protection in April less than three years ago and emerged the following November.###1663||Alibaba’s dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.

In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China’s internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country’s smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.

China’s biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd, is leading the revolt, linking the country’s most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.

An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba’s lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant’s Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.

“In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it – it’s a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organizational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,” said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin’s company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba’s Tmall.

Alibaba’s e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma’s firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. – potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company – which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.

Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China’s e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China’s legions of smartphone users.

Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm’s e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week.

Peeling away

Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s grocery retailer Yihaodian.

Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba’s market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.

“We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,” said Wang.

Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.

“As a mature Internet brand we’re looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,” Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women’s apparel retailers on Alibaba’s platforms. “We go and sell our products where the consumers are.”

Rivals rising

Alibaba’s vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba – and ambitious.

JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent – a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value – will give it new financial and operational resources.

Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in “the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market”, Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.

As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.

“I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,” said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. “It’s not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more.”

Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop’s online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.

Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.

Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart’s global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.

Ma vs Ma

Alibaba’s Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma – a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China’s central bank.

When Tencent launched a “red envelope” feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a “Pearl Harbour attack” on his company’s Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.

Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent’s WeChat.

WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a “killer weapon” for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.

China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country’s mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.

“The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,” said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.

“Firms are all lining up – the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba – and the camps are forming,” said Zhang.

* Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac would be liquidated under plan

* Government would offer a catastrophic loan backstop

* New agency would collect fees to cover its costs

By Margaret Chadbourn

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - The leaders of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday announced an agreement on legislation to wind down government-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, jump-starting a long-standing debate that could still take years to resolve.

Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a Democrat, and Senator Mike Crapo, the panel’s top Republican, outlined the plan in bullet point format after months of talks that included input from the Obama administration. They said they intended to introduce a bill soon, with an eye to having the panel vote on it within weeks.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee 60 percent of all U.S. home loans, provide a steady source of mortgage funds by buying loans from lenders and packaging them into securities they sell to investors with a guarantee.

Their central role in the mortgage market led the government to bail them out to the tune of $187.5 billion in the midst of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and lawmakers want to make sure taxpayers are never on the hook again.

Under the outline from Johnson and Crapo, private interests would take the first 10 percent of any mortgage losses, before an industry-financed government backstop would kick in.

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie, while protecting taxpayers,” Crapo said in a statement.

Analysts cautioned, however, that the lawmakers face an uphill battle in trying to enact legislation this year. Any bill that clears the Democrat-led Senate would have to win approval in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where some lawmakers want a fully private system.

“This is another step towards reform, but we are still years away from having either the legislative capacity or market willingness to embrace a new mortgage finance system,” said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst with Compass Point Research and Trading.

SHRINKING THE MARKET?

Under the proposal, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be wound down and replaced with a new government reinsurer called the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corp. The new entity, which would be funded by user fees, would issue a federal guarantee for mortgage bonds that would kick in only after private creditors had taken a hit.

Included in the outline is a mandate that strong loan underwriting standards be built into the new system.

It would also require a 5 percent downpayment for all but first-time buyers, although that requirement would be phased-in over time. Some consumer and housing advocates worry that a system with rigid downpayments will prevent less affluent Americans from accessing credit.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy,” said Johnson. “This bipartisan effort will provide the market the certainty it needs.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a huge role in keeping borrowing costs low for homeowners, and the guarantees they provide investors are the main reason Americans are able to secure 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.

Whether enough private capital would flow into the market to fully replace their footprint is uncertain. Some analysts said placing more of the burden of losses on private investors would lead to a shrinking of the $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market.

“The Johnson-Crapo bill means a redesigned, smaller U.S. mortgage market because it takes a tough stand on taxpayer protection,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics.

The outline from the two senators said they plan to eliminate affordable housing goals that Congress had given Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, they would establish housing-related funds to ensure the availability of affordable rental properties. These funds would be financed through a user fee on lenders that seek government backing for their loans.

To ensure community banks are not squeezed out of the system, the senators said they would seek to establish a “mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders” to offer a cash window for eligible loans while allowing the institutions to retain mortgage servicing rights.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized by regulators in 2008 as loan defaults drove them toward insolvency. But they have since returned to profitability and have returned $202.9 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury for the controlling stake the government took when it bailed them out.

Private shareholders, including Perry Capital and Fairholme Capital Management, have sued the United States over bailout terms that prevent the companies from using their profits to buy back the government’s shares.

Johnson and Crapo did not outline how they believed these private shareholders should be handled. The preferred shares of the two companies , which have been trading at their highest levels since 2008, fell sharply on Tuesday.###1668||Empty###1669||Choose the plan that’s right for you.

They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering possibilities including hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Attention had been focused on the Boeing 777's two pilots , given the assessment by experts and officials that whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience.

CBS News rounds up the latest on where the investigation stands now.

FBI assisting investigation - The FBI is assisting the Malaysian government in reading the flight simulator confiscated at the home of the plane's captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Malaysian officials said they were trying to restore files which they said were deleted last month.

CBS News learned the hard drive of the flight simulator is at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where analysts were said on March 26 to be in the final stages of analyzing it.



The FBI was able to recover some of the deleted files, but sources told CBS News nothing had emerged to raise any suspicions thus far. Nor did investigators find anything on the two pilots' personal computers to be particularly significant to the investigation, the sources said.

In Kuala Lumpur, a senior Malaysian law enforcement official told CBS News on March 27 that, at this point in the investigation, there was no tangible evidence connecting any individual (including either of the pilots) with the crash of Flight 370. While the official said any reporting suggesting fault on the part of either pilot would be "speculation."



Files deleted from flight simulator - According to Malaysian officials, the files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted Feb. 3 from the elaborate flight simulator found in Zaharie's home. It was not immediately clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. Citing a senior police officer with direct knowledge of the investigation, Reuters reported that the simulator included programs for runways in the Maldives, Sri Lanka and other Indian Ocean countries, as well as runways in the U.S. and Europe.

Practicing on different kinds of runways would not be unusual, CBS News national security analyst Juan Zarate said. But, he added, authorities will have to check what those runways look like to see if they "match with runways in the region and perhaps some smaller runways in the Indian Ocean that could give them some clues as to where to look."

Zaharie had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories.

Course change programmed into flight computer - Sources told CBS News that there's evidence Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned off its route when someone typed a course change into a cockpit navigation computer called the flight management system, which would require training in the Boeing 777 systems. But sources say checks of the pilots' email and computers turned up nothing to suggest a plot.

"All right, good night" - Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Monday that "initial investigations show it was the co-pilot who spoke" those final words from the cockpit to air traffic control. But government officials did not say the speaker's identity had been confirmed. Officials also revised the timeline for that final message, suggesting that it may have come shortly before the flight's Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, was shut off, rather than after.



Pilots' homes raided - Malaysian police searched the homes of both pilot, Zaharie, and the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, Saturday. Whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said, adding to suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Passengers and crew investigated - Malaysian officials said Wednesday that requested background checks had been received for all foreign passengers except those from Ukraine and Russia - which account for three passengers. China said background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved in the disappearance. Malaysian officials said Wednesday that the requested background checks

CBS News' Seth Doane reported Monday that investigators were also paying close attention to one of the passengers who was a flight engineer for a private aviation charter company. He was believed to be heading for Beijing to check on one of his company's charter aircraft.



Malaysian police were also looking into the engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.

FBI formally joins investigation - A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name, said the FBI has been provided electronic data to analyze. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday U.S. investigators are prepared to help any way they can.

While the FBI had sent representatives to Malaysia and offered to help with the investigation, the Americans had not been invited to participate in the Malaysian-led probe, CBS News' Bob Orr reports. "It's a Malaysian airline flight that was lost, but we are assisting, as are many other nations, in every way that we can," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Friday.

"You have to look at everything" - Investigators must check out every possible explanation, ranging from terrorism to pilot suicide to cargo theft or smuggling, said Ken Maxwell, one of the principal investigators of the TWA 800 and Egypt Air 990 flight disasters. In an interview with CBS News, Maxwell said that the scope of the criminal investigation "will be extremely broad," and that investigators have to consider, "What's in the cargo? Who's on that plane? Who would have motive or intent to utilize that aircraft?"



###1673||Since the start of the year, Republican leaders have insisted their party would soon put forward a health care alternative to ObamaCare. That day may almost be here, as The Washington Post's Robert Costa reports the GOP leadership is finally unifying behind a conservative plan "in part to draw an election-year contrast" with Democrats and ObamaCare.

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.

The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills. [Washington Post]

Coming after years of GOP threats to repeal ObamaCare and revert to the old health care system, the mere fact that the party may soon offer a true, unified alternative underscores how far the policy debate has shifted since the health care exchanges went live in October. With more than 4.2 million people having now enrolled in new insurance plans via ObamaCare, calling for repeal alone would mean advocating for those millions of newly insured to lose their coverage. And polls have consistently shown that the public's general opposition to the law does not translate into support for repeal. As Jonathan Chait put it last week, Republicans "have won the public relations war over ObamaCare, and they have lost the public relations war over repealing ObamaCare."

HONG KONG, March 17 — A gauge of expected price swings in China’s Yuan climbed to an 18-month high and the offshore exchange rate weakened as the central bank doubled the currency’s trading limits versus the dollar.

One-month implied volatility, which is used to price options, rose 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 2.72 percent as of 8:22 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 2.73 percent, the highest since September 2012. The offshore Yuan weakened 0.11 percent to 6.1623 per dollar and reached the lowest intra-day level since May. The People’s Bank of China will announce the daily reference rate at around 9:15 a.m, while the Yuan in Shanghai will start trading at 9:30 a.m.

The onshore Yuan is allowed, from today, to trade as much as 2 percent on either side of the reference rate, the People’s Bank of China said in a March 15 statement. The previous limit was 1 percent. The move came after Premier Li Keqiang and the central bank both named broadening the Yuan band among their 2014 policy goals, which included pledges to give market forces a bigger role in the world’s second-biggest economy.

“With the expansion of the trading band, greater uncertainty will be introduced for market participants,” Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based currency strategist at Scotiabank, wrote in a note yesterday. “A more volatile exchange rate and higher fixing tendency could indeed incent hot money outflows if onshore policy makers are not careful with how they transmit their renminbi-valuation notions to markets.”

Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent to 6.2110 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is a 1 percent discount to the Yuan’s March 14 close in Shanghai. The contracts fell 1.1 percent last week, the biggest weekly drop since November 2011. — Bloomberg###1676||Investing.com -

Investing.com - The pound fell to two-week lows against the dollar on Tuesday after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney indicated that there is leeway for the bank to leave rates on hold for longer.

GBP/USD hit 1.6597, the lowest since February 24 and was last down 0.20% to 1.6610.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6550 and resistance at 1.6685.

During testimony to parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, Carney said the amount of spare capacity in the economy was probably slightly higher than 1.5% of gross domestic product, indicating that the economic recovery can continue without pushing up inflation.

He added that there was a range of views among the bank's monetary policy committee members on the amount of spare capacity in the economy.

Carney also reiterated that when rate increases do come they will be gradual.

Sterling has strengthened against many of the other main currencies in recent months, amid expectations the BoE could raise rates ahead of other central banks.

Earlier Tuesday, data showed that U.K. manufacturing output rose more than expected in January, but bad weather hampered the broader measure of industrial output.

Manufacturing production rose 0.4% in January, the Office for National Statistics reported, above expectations for a 0.3% gain, while December's figure was revised up to a 0.4% increase from a previously reported gain of 0.3%.

On a year-over-year basis, manufacturing production rose 3.3%, up from 1.4% in December.

Industrial output rose 0.1% in January, slowing sharply after a 0.5% increase in December and was up 2.9% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected industrial output to rise 0.2% in January.

Elsewhere, sterling was little changed against the euro, with EUR/GBP inching up 0.01% to 0.8340.

The pair briefly dipped to session lows earlier after European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said the bank made its forward guidance on the existence of slack in the euro zone economy more precise at last week's meeting, but this was not picked up by markets.

He also said the central bank still had policy options available, including lower interest rates or quantitative easing, if necessary.###1677||Article Tools Font size – + Share This



Fishermen huddled in their huts on a frozen lake in Michigan as a small drone flew toward them.

The drone, lifted by six helicopter rotors that spun on spidery arms, landed on the ice and departed after unclamping its cargo, a case of Lakemaid Beer.

As the test flight shows, drones can be the friends of fishermen and hunters, even though a bill introduced in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives would outlaw their use if it annoys people enjoying the outdoors.

In addition to delivering supplies or medicine to remote areas, drones can help foresters, for example, by surveying hunting land for damage done by gypsy moths.

Drones might cost less than the manned aircraft that state agencies now hire for aerial surveys.

Live video of wildfires from drones could help ground crews plan attacks and protect themselves.

The Federal Aviation Administration seeks to integrate drones into the nation's airspace without interfering with current users or decreasing safety in the air or on the ground.

So far, the FAA reacted faster to the needs of public agencies, such as foresters, than of businesses like Lakemaid Beer.

As the year began, 545 public agencies received waivers from the FAA to fly drones for purposes such as border and port monitoring, firefighting, search and rescues and military training.

Last year, the agency also let public safety agencies fly drones weighing less than 4.4 pounds during daylight if the drones fly below 400 feet and stay within sight of the operator.

Businesses still have to wait.

The FAA grounded Lakemaid Beer deliveries after seeing a video of a flight on YouTube.

Currently, the FAA only certifies two models of drones as airworthy for commercial use, and they only are approved for flights in the Arctic.

Other countries let businesses fly drones sooner.

Helicopter drones as heavy as 140 pounds spray and fertilize fields in Japan.

At the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, drones took video of snowboarding and ski jumping.

The FAA said the airspace in the United States is busier and more complex than in any other nation.

The agency probably will develop rules for small drones, those weighing less than 55 pounds, first. That means drones with which Amazon.com wants to deliver packages might win approval faster than unmanned cargo jets.

An FAA rule requires aircraft to see and avoid other aircraft, but drones lack that ability. The next generation of detection systems using GPS require aircraft to transmit their position and speed, but fitting all aircraft with the systems will be expensive, Jack Langelaan, an associate professor of aerospace engineering at Penn State University, said.

"Until this is solved I don't expect to see regular flights of large, unmanned cargo planes in the national airspace," Langelaan said by email.

At Griffiss International Airport in Rome, N.Y., a research consortium will study avoidance technology. Griffiss is one of six sites that the FAA selected at the end of 2013 to conduct research that will help develop procedures for permitting flights of commercial drones.

Larry Brinker, the executive director of NUAIR Alliance, the organization overseeing the effort at Griffiss, is a former cargo pilot. He said FedEx and United Parcel Service have expressed interest in drones. The Cessna Caravans that air freighters use on regional hops could be modified to fly without pilots when regulations allow, Brinker said.

Langelaan said colleagues at universities around the country hope drones will help them take measurements in the atmosphere, inside the mouth of volcanoes and inside storm clouds that will swirl into tornadoes.

Drones also might help take surveys of wildlife, wetlands and minelands.

Energy companies think drones can monitor pipelines and power plants.

Local governments can keep tabs on land use from the air, whereas realtors can show properties with videos that drones take.

News organizations could use drones to compile traffic reports, and filmmakers have used drones in movies.

In 2011 a filmmaker was flying a radio-controlled plane that was made of Styrofoam and weighed 4½ pounds over the University of Virginia to take video and photos for advertisements.

The FAA fined him $10,000, but an administrative law judge with the National Transportation Safety Board dismissed the fine on March 6.

In the ruling, the judge faulted the FAA's reasoning, which he said would have led to unintended consequences such as regulating paper airplanes or balsa-wood gliders. The ruling briefly cast doubt on the FAA's authority to regulate drones, but the FAA appealed and obtained a stay until the full board hears the case.

New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley told the Wall Street Journal that he will suggest doing away with the Fed’s 6.5% unemployment rate threshold for raising in short-term interest rates at the central bank’s meeting later this month. He described the unemployment rate threshold as “obsolete.” Dudley also said that the Fed is committed to tapering its monthly bond-buying and that the economic “outlook would have to change in a material way” for the Fed to alter its course.

The US press has expressed doubts over the longevity of the business, given its reliance on the one game, with The Atlantic Magazine calling the company a “horrible investment”.This week’s New Yorker also called King “part of a venerable tradition: the one-hit wonder” and drew parallels to the disastrous float of the gaming firm Zynga in 2011.

The company is currently worth $4.7 billion.Tech investors have defended King’s valuation, denying it would be a repeat of Zynga. One Londonbased venture capitalist said the company was not a “flash in the pan”, pointing out: “It’s more than a decade old and had been cash-flow positive since 2005.”The spreadbetting firm ETX Capital has been running a grey market for King, which ahead of Wednesday’s pricing announcement valued the company at between $6.82 billion and $9.32 billion.

Tripoli, Libya (PANA) - The North Korean tanker, which was seized by the Libyan military after loading an illegal shipment of crude oil from the Al- Sidera port being held by a separatist armed group in eastern Libya, has escaped from the North African nation, according to sources close to the Libyan National Congress (Parliament).



The oil tanker, named ''Glory morning”, escaped to international waters after shaking off the Libyan navy boats which had surrounded it, Abdelkader al- Houeily, member of the Committee on Energy of the Congress said on the al Nabaa - TV.



"The North Korean tanker took advantage of the bad weather to escape (from) the Libyan navy boats not designed to sail in bad weather conditions," he said.



On Monday night, contradictory information had circulated about who really controls the North Korean tanker, as Libyan government said it was under its control while the separatist armed group said it was in charge.



Last Saturday, the tanker docked at Al- Sedra, prompting Libyan authorities to send navy boats to prevent it from leaving the country's territorial waters.

The new name, a reference to the Stamford, Conn., firm’s address at 72 Cummings Point Road, was revealed Tuesday in a memo to employees. The change takes effect next month.

The name change and transfer of employees comes as SAC’s settlement and guilty plea to criminal insider-trading charges goes before a federal judge on April 10, when it may or may not be approved.

“Our two new long/short trading divisions will do business as Point72 Asset Management and EverPoint Asset Management,” SAC President Tom Conheeney wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Post.

A third SAC operation, its multi-quant business, will be called Cubist Systematic Strategies, a nod to Cohen’s status as a major modern art investor.

Conheeney said Cohen and senior management decided the firm’s “path forward” as a family office would be easier under “new legal entities and new names.”

Teams from the soon-to-be-renamed CR Intrinsic, Sigma and SAC — all divisions where insider trading took place — will move to Point72 in Stamford and EverPoint in New York City. Employee transfers are scheduled for April 7. Cohen’s private investments will be managed by Cohen Private Ventures.

As part of the deal SAC struck with US Attorney Preet Bharara, the firm agreed to return all outside investor money, accepted a probationary period of five years and has to pay for an independent compliance consultant.

“We have been through a great deal during the past few years,” the memo concluded. “Our new names, combined with the other changes we have announced, are intended to help us move forward.”###1690||After marijuana sales became legal on Jan. 1, Colorado State has reportedly raked in about $2 million off taxes from just recreational users in the first month.

According to the Associated Press, the state Department of Revenue officials reported Monday that the tax total indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold and the state collected about $2.01 million in taxes.

Despite purchases being limited to only one ounce for those 21 and older, state officials said the numbers came in as expected. Recreational marijuana has a 15 percent excise tax and 2.9 percent sales tax in the state. When combined with taxes and fees from marijuana sells, the state brought in a total of $3.5 million in January from pot sales.

The AP reported that the first "$40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction," some of the tax money is being spent on campaigns and treatment programs, an effort to convince kids to avoid smoking pot. The remaining cash will be "spent by state lawmakers."

Colorado legalized pot in 2012 and voters approved the pot taxes last year. Colorado became the first state to permit the selling of non-medicinal pot.

The Rocky Mountain state has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores. Only 24 stores were ready to sell by the start of the year, due to licensing issues. Several places have become creative with the selling of marijuana, baking it to pastries and treats.###1691||Empty###1692||HSBC Bank (NYSE:HSBC) updated its mortgage rate information for Tuesday, March 11, which shows further improvements in interest rates, following downticks a day earlier.

Bank of England Governor says it will be a 'welcome time' when rates rise

Bank rate has been at record low of 0.5% for more than five years

Savers have lost £300billion in interest but mortgages have remained low



Interest rates could rise in months before the general election, regeardles on the impact on voters, Mark Carney revealed today.

The Bank of England governor said it would be ‘a welcome time’ when rates do rise from their record lows, but other factors would play a part in deciding when to begin an increase.

Mr Carney struck an upbeat tone, claiming the ‘end of the recovery is in progress’ but Britain will continue to face ‘extraordinary times’ for many years.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the Treasury select committee it would be a 'welcome time' when rates do rise

Bank of England interest rates have been at 0.5 per cent for more than five years as a result of the financial crash and the recession which followed.

Mr Carney had set a target of unemployment falling to 7 per cent before he would consider increasing the cost of borrowing, but six months later strong jobs growth meant that figure has almost been reached already.

Today he argued that the better-than-expected recovery would mean the prospect of a rise in the cost of borrowing was now a ‘welcome’ possibility.

But he rejected the idea that the timing of the general electon, due on May 7, 2015, would play a part.

A rise in interest rates ahead of polling day would be a boost for savers who have seen £300billion wiped off the value of their nest eggs.

RBS COULD BE FORCED SOUTH AMID WARNINGS OF HIGHER DEBT

There is a 'distinct possibility' that the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move outside of Scotland if voters back independence, Mark Carney warned. MPs were also told that the rest of the UK was likely to end up bailing out Scotland in the event of a crisis if there was a currency union even if there were explicit guarantees written into an agreement ruling out such an event. European laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit Scotland, the Treasury select committee heard. Asked if RBS would have to move to the remaining UK if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: 'It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it. 'It depends on their arrangements as well, if they were to adjust more into Scotland the minor management of the institution.' It came amid claims an independent Scotland could face a deficit at least £3 billion greater than Alex Salmond has claimed. The Scottish Government has estimated that the country would have a deficit of 3.2 per cent of GDP, or £5.5 billion, but that figure is up to 2.2 per lower than projections by other organisations including think tanks, Citi Group and the Treasury. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Mr Salmond's position was 'bereft of any credibility' as he urged the nation not to 'walk away from one of the most successful political, economic and social unions that the world has ever seen'.



But homeowners could suddenly find themselves faced with bigger mortgage bills as they ponder whether they want David Cameron or Ed Miliband in Number 10.

Earlier this year Martin Weale, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, suggested it would be ‘difficult’ for rates to rise during the election campaign.

But Mr Carney insisted the timing would not be affected by politics. He told MPs: ‘When the time comes - a welcome time - to raise rates, we expect it to be gradual and the degree to be limited

‘We will still be living in extraordinary times a few years down the road," he added, referring to the slow recovery in Europe, emerging market turmoil and higher borrowing costs in financial markets.'

The central bank boss told the Treasury Select Committee his flagship forward guidance policy had helped drive the bounce back in the economy, despite having to abandon linking rates to unemployment after just six months.

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said the Bank appeared to be ‘back to where it started’ with rate-setting based on a variety of economic indicators, as it was before forward guidance was first introduced last August.

The pledge to link rates to unemployment had been well understood by businesses, giving them confidence to make hiring and spending decisions, which has in turn boosted the recovery, he said.

Mr Carney added: ‘We are moving to a period where the end of the recovery is in progress and the start of expansion should happen this year and we are moving to a period where the more conventional operation of monetary policy is a possibility, which is welcome.’

He admitted the Bank's forecasts had been woefully wrong, having first predicted unemployment would not reach 7 per cent until 2016 - a threshold that is set to be hit within months.

It has been holding an internal review of its forecasting capability and is set to report the findings next week, he said.

The Bank last week held rates once more, marking the five-year anniversary of its decision to slash rates to the historic low of 0.5 per cent.

But members of the MPC have repeatedly signalled that rates may rise next year as the economic recovery picks up pace, with the market expecting a hike at the start of the second quarter.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned that Mr Carney may be forced to raise interest rates earlier than he wishes by the ‘lopsided’ housing market, which has seen prices rise much faster in London and the South East than in other parts of the country.

Mr Balls urged the Government to build more houses to bring demand for homes more in line with supply.###1698||* Asian shares rebound after big losses but gains cut after soft China data

* Concerns over Ukraine, China slowdown and copper rout sap risk appetite

* Gold hits 6-month high; euro, Swiss franc 2 1/2-year high vs dollar

* European shares likely to rise, DAX seen up 0.5 pct

By Hideyuki Sano

TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares cautiously rebounded from two-week lows on Thursday but gains were pared after disappointing retail sales and factory output data underscored investors’ concerns over slowdown in China.

A standoff in Ukraine and a massive fall in copper prices in recent weeks also spooked investors, although a flat close on Wall Street and some positive data in Australia and Japan helped to cushion the blow.

European shares are expected to recoup some of their heavy losses on Wednesday, with Germany’s DAX seen as rising as much as 0.5 percent and France’s CAC 0.4 percent.

In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, recouping a half of its losses the previous day, with Australian shares gaining on strong local employment data.

But soft Chinese data dented many markets, with Japan’s Nikkei slipping 0.1 percent, erasing gains made after Japanese machinery orders beat expectations. South Korean shares <.KS11 >also erased most of its gains to end up 0.1 percent.

“What we’re seeing today is a reaction to yesterday’s sharp decline based on price (valuation) merits,” said Hana Daetoo analyst Chang Hee-jong.

“But concerns about China remain the biggest issue for the market, and this will continue to affect markets throughout the first half of this year.”

China’s Jan-Feb industrial output growth came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries growth could fall as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.

“Jan-Feb figures were disappointing, implying weaker growth momentum in China’s economy. Probably a storm is coming,” said Gao Yuan, analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai.

A major victim of concerns over China, copper dropped 0.4 percent to $6,508 a tonne, a day after it hit a four-year low at $6376.25 hit on Wednesday.

After a drop of around 7 percent so far this month, investors are worried about a possible unravelling of Chinese loan deals using copper as collateral, which could cause some investors more pains.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 reversed early losses and ended nearly flat, outperforming many others thanks in part to a string of positive data on the U.S. economy.

EURO AT 2 1/2 YEAR HIGH

The diplomatic stalemate between Russia and the West over Ukraine has also led investors to buy traditional safe haven assets as the European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.

Gold hit a six-month high of $1374.85.

U.S. Treasuries have erased all their losses after last week’s strong payrolls data, with the benchmark 10-year yield at 2.73 percent versus its six-week high of 2.82 percent hit on Friday.

In the currency market, the Swiss franc hit a two-and-a-half year high of 0.87322 franc to the dollar, while the Japanese yen, which is under pressure from the Bank of Japan’s easing, also ticked up slightly.

The euro also hit 2 1/2-year high of $1.3949, in a possible sign that the currency is regaining a safe haven status as it recovers from the sovereign debt crisis.

In a symbolic move, the Irish government returns to the market with its first regular debt auction on Thursday since it asked for an international bailout three years ago.

On the other hand, the New Zealand dollar hit a 10-month high of $0.8582 after the country’s central bank raised rates as expected and pointed to further tightening ahead to curb inflationary pressures.

The action put the Reserve bank of New Zealand well ahead of major central banks in developed economies, who are still grappling with the aftermath of the financial crisis, helping the kiwi against a basket of currencies at a post-float high .

The Australian dollar also jumped 0.7 percent to $0.9045 after data showed an outsized increase in payrolls .

U.S. crude futures traded near one-month lows hit on Wednesday after Washington announced a surprise plan for a test release of strategic oil reserves, trading at $98.06 per barrel, near Wednesday’s low of $97.55.

But the European benchmark Brent held relatively firm at $108.14 as it drew support from the unfolding crisis over Ukraine.###1699||Empty###1700||Gold surged in heavy Wednesday trading as investors digested a new and tougher warning issued by the G7 nations to Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. Rising tensions over Russia’s occupation of the Crimea region have boosted the metal’s safe haven appeal.

In a statement, the G7 nations denounced Russia’s “clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” The language signaled a hardening stance by European nations against the planned referendum on Crimea’s secession from Ukraine, currently planned for Sunday. On Wednesday, the European Union reportedly agreed to a framework of possible economic sanctions against Russia that could be imposed if a diplomatic solution is not found soon.

Its management said the amount was stolen after hackers exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, but some of Mt. Gox's users are not so sure, suggesting instead that the exchange's owners pocketed the cash. Now, facing silence from those owners about the fate of the money and the methods by which 6 percent of all of the Bitcoin in the world could have been stolen, a group of hackers claims it has broken into the bankrupted Bitcoin exchange's network to get answers.

Forbes reports that the group gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO. The hackers used the platforms to post a message that claimed Karpeles still had access to some of the bitcoins that he'd reported stolen. In support of the claim, they uploaded a series of files that included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, Karpeles' home addresses, and a screenshot purportedly confirming the hackers' access to the data.

Also included as part of the 716MB file was a file that appears to show the exchange's balances in 18 currencies. The hackers point to this file — which reportedly shows a balance of 951,116 bitcoins — as evidence that Mt. Gox is misrepresenting the current situation. A note in the file from the hackers reportedly reads "That fat fuck has been lying!!"

The files could simply show poor accounting practices

Forbes says the veracity of the file has yet to be confirmed. It could simply highlight the kind of poor accounting practices that allowed hackers to steal the money in the first place, showing money in Mt. Gox's balances that has long since made its way to hacker hands; or it could be evidence to support the theory that the company used the cover of a transaction exploit to steal its customers' money. The exchange claimed it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins in its bankruptcy protection filing — in addition to 100,000 of its own bitcoins — but users of the cryptocurrency are yet to see that money appear on the log of public Bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain. That would suggest whoever does have the money isn't spending it at the moment.

Forbes suggests the hack may be related to another supposed breach in which a user on BitcoinTalk's forums offered a 20GB file that they said was also stolen from Mt. Gox. The user claims the file is full of Mt. Gox users' personal details and passport scans, and that they were planning to sell it for 100 bitcoins "one or two times to make up personal losses from Mt. Gox closure."###1702||Empty###1703||Empty###1704||Empty###1705||Why is the Federal Reserve so hard to understand?

In politics, complex concepts are often oversimplified to make a point.

But the Federal Reserve plays a different kind of political game. The leaders of the powerful independent government agency, whose every moves have the power to influence world markets, often purposefully try to be a little hard to understand.

Expect new Fed Chair Janet Yellen to throw out phrases like substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and quantitative easing in her first press conference Wednesday when shes explaining the agencys monetary policy for 2014.

Wall Street will inevitably react, or overreact, to whatever she says. Investors may even be confused by it.

But theres a method behind her madness. Yellen knows if youre a Fed leader, sometimes being transparent can backfire.

Take Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who tried to spell out in June 2013 almost exactly when the Fed would ease off its stimulus of keeping interest rates near zero percent.

Worried they could see the light at the end of the tunnel, investors panicked and the market tanked.

Today, Fed watchers believe the agency is regretting spelling out its plans so clearly. So its possible this week well hear press conferences full of more mumbo-jumbo economic terms that confuse even economic experts, says The Washington Posts Ylan Mui.

And while markets are fretting over every phrase, and yes, may take a short-term tumble, know that for the foreseeable future, anything the Fed says is likely to keep your interest rates low.###1706||These are stories Report on Business is following Tuesday, March 11, 2014.

OECD sees pick-up

The harsh Canadian winter is playing havoc with the economy, but the OECD expects something of a rebound in the second quarter of the year.

Story continues below advertisement

"The United States and Canada are both also expected to experience an uneven pattern of growth in the near term, owing in part to the disruptive effect of repeated episodes of severe winter weather," the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said today in its interim economic assessment.

"A number of activities were restrained by the storms and cold temperatures, which is likely to depress first-quarter GDP, with some bounce-back effect in the second quarter in the absence of further negative shocks."

Canadians are, of course, used to wretched winters, but this one has been particularly ugly, as the OECD noted.

In its new report, the group forecasts first-quarter economic growth of just 0.5 per cent in the current quarter, but, given "one-off factors," could not update its projection for the second quarter.

In November, it forecast second-quarter growth at 2.4 per cent.

According to the latest reading by Statistics Canada, the economy expanded in the fourth quarter at an annual pace of 2.9 per cent, though contracted 0.5 per cent in December, the month of an ice storm.

Over all, the OECD said today that "most signs" point to stronger growth in the world's big advanced economies, boosted by the easy money policies of their central banks and "reduced fiscal drag."

But, as others have warned, emerging market countries have a "more mixed" showing, with some "continuing to grow strongly while others, where underlying vulnerabilities have been highlighted by reversals of capital inflows, are experiencing a marked loss of momentum."

The group pointed directly to the easing of stimulus measures by the Federal Reserve, which is hitting some of the emerging markets.

That, the OECD suggested, means the U.S. central bank should "proceed cautiously, with a careful communications policy to smooth expectations."

A number of one-off factors, such as the U.S. government shutdown last fall and December's weather woes, have hurt the overall pace of economic growth in the Group of Seven nations.

"Nonetheless, in most of the major advanced economies fourth-quarter GDP growth was better than expected, and consensus forecasts for 2014 have ratcheted up over the last few months," the OECD said.

Ford in fight with Harper

Canada's prime minister is in a war of words today with the chief of Ford Motor Co.'s Canadian operation over a free trade deal with South Korea.

Story continues below advertisement

Dianne Craig, chief executive officer of Ford Canada, objects to the trade agreement, warning in a statement today that "we believe that South Korea will remain one of the most closed automotive markets in the world under the deal negotiated by the Canadian government.

Ford, she said, can "compete and win" when the playing field is level.

"But no Canadian manufacturer can compete with a market controlled by non-tariff barriers and currency manipulation," Ms. Craig said.

"The trade agreement negotiated by the Canadian government with South Korea fails to address these issues."

As The Globe and Mail's Nathan VanderKlippe reports from Seoul, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who unveiled the trade deal, cited the fact that Ford Canada's U.S. parent had no problem with an America-Korea agreement two years ago.

"What we are doing here is allowing other Canadian companies and other Canadian sectors to have the same access that Ford already has," he said.

China in pilot project

China is embarking on a pilot project to develop private banks that will involve 10 companies.

The national regulatory group said today the program will be tested in Tianjim, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Guangdong, Reuters reports.

Among the companies are the large Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, two e-commerce groups.

The program will see the creation of five institutions, with two investors apiece.

Business ticker###1707||Empty###1708||###1709||BEIJING - China pledged on Sunday that it will make sure that 60 percent of its cities meet national pollution standards by 2020, with pressure growing to make cities liveable as hundreds of millions of migrants are expected to relocate from the countryside.

China&39;s environmental problems such as pollution and water scarcity are expected to intensify as rapid migration pushes urban infrastructures to the limit. Almost all Chinese cities monitored for pollution last year failed to meet the standards.

The environment has emerged as a key priority amid growing public disquiet about smog, dwindling and polluted water supplies and the contamination of farmland. Poor air quality is estimated to end hundreds of thousands of lives prematurely each year and has led to a series of riots and public protests.

The pledge to clean up the nation&39;s major metropolitan centres was made in a State Council plan for how to deal with China&39;s rapid urbanisation drive.

"We will improve and promote green, sustainable and low carbon development in the urbanisation process, enforcing the strictest measures on ecological and environmental systems," the plan said.

According to the State Council, 60 percent of the cities will meet national air quality standards in 2020, which it said was up from 40 percent in 2012.

However, at China&39;s annual parliamentary session earlier this month, officials said only three of 74 major cities met the pollution standards in 2013.

The State Council plan outlined a lengthy list of policies it will implement to meet the target, including boosting renewable energy use, curbing emission-intensive industries and taking the most-polluting vehicles off the roads.

China will also set up a tiered pricing system for electricity, natural gas and water, to control rapid growth in consumption of scarce natural resources.

The government plans to roll out trading systems for carbon and air pollutant emissions, energy-saving certificates and water to provide economic incentives to reduce waste.

China has already picked seven key regions to launch pilot carbon trading schemes with the intention of setting up a national market to cut emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.

Guangdong province has already launched an emissions trading scheme, along with the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin.

FOOD SECURITY

China is also seeking to ensure it has enough labour in its vast farming sector to guarantee food security, with rural worker shortages one of the country&39;s biggest challenges.

The State Council plan restated China&39;s commitment to protect agricultural land from further urban and industrial encroachment, a policy known as its "red line." It promised more state investment in major food-producing regions, improved insurance coverage in rural areas and reforms to the pricing systems of major agricultural commodities.

It also promised to raise farming mechanisation rates to around 70 percent from current levels of 60 percent.###1710||Empty###1711||Empty###1712||###1713||The success of Toyota's localised production in India to cater for a growing car buyers market has been marred with recent industrial relations issues over wages — AFP pic

TOKYO, March 17 — Toyota Motor Corp’s Indian unit has declared a lockout of its workers at two car plants after strained salary negotiations spurred workers to stop production lines.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) in a statement said it has locked out workers at the plants near Bangalore since Sunday. It did not state for how long the lockout will continue.

Over the past 25 days, some workers have stopped production lines and disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government failed to reach an agreement over salaries, TKM said.

“The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel,” TKM said.

Tokyo-based Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino said the unit and union will continue holding talks to resolve the issue.

If operations are suspended, that would result in a production loss of 700 vehicles a day, Sumino said.

TKM manufactures vehicles including the Fortuner and Innova at its 1st plant, where production started in 1997. At the 2nd plant, which opened in 2010, it makes cars including the Etios and Corolla Altis.

Toyota is not the first Japanese carmaker to be hit by labor relations troubles in India.

The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.

Spokesmen for the Justice Department and GM would not comment. The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg.

At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government’s road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn’t take action sooner.

GM announced last month it will replace ignition switches that can shut off car motors unexpectedly. When that happens, drivers lose power-assisted steering and brakes and can lose control of the cars. The ignition can slip from the run position to accessory or off, due partly to heavy key chains dangling from the steering column.

Also, if the ignition switch isn’t in the run position, air bags may not inflate if a crash occurs.

An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found that drivers started submitting complaints about the problem in early 2005, shortly after the first Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale. The review of complaints about the Cobalt, GM’s top-selling small car in the mid-2000s, found 173 instances of engine stalling or air bags failing to deploy, both symptoms of the ignition problem. Many drivers reported problems with keys sticking in the ignition in addition to the stalling.

Fred Upton of Western Michigan, the chairman of the House committee, said in a statement Monday that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks.

Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to NHTSA. The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.

Upton said the committee wants to know if GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.

“If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,” Upton said.

NHTSA has said the rate of problems in the GM cars was not significantly different from similar vehicles.

The prospect of congressional hearings means more bad publicity for GM, which is trying to distance itself from a reputation for building lousy cars. The company has said it’s more focused on quality since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009.

“It’s the old GM haunting the new GM,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports magazine. “They have a lot of the old products still hanging around.”

Fisher said GM’s new cars and trucks will have to be better than the competition to lure back buyers who swore years ago to never again to buy a GM car.

NHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the ignition problem. The agency could fine GM up to $35 million for a delayed response. Automakers must report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them.

GM said in a statement that it’s co-operating with NHTSA and the House committee.

On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).

GM said Monday that it has hired attorney Anton Valukas to investigate the company’s actions before the recall. Valukas, who investigated the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers for a bankruptcy court. GM has promised an “unvarnished” investigation into the recall.###1718||Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.

Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.

A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox’s request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets.

Mt. Gox’s Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox’s request for Chapter 15 protection.

Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.

In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.

Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.

Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###1719||Empty###1720||Empty###1721||With just two weeks remaining before the window slams shut on the Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment period, unquestionably, the best advice for the uninsured is to run – don’t walk – to get help with the enrollment process. But once you’ve made that decision to enroll, this advice is equally critical: Avoid the huge rookie error of buying the cheapest plan available and focus on finding plans that fit your situation.

There’s not just good news and bad news. There’s very good news and very bad news.

The very good news is that – chances are – you’ll find that good coverage will cost you less than you might expect because of the availability of tax credits and subsidies to help you afford insurance. By the end of February, 4.2 million Americans had enrolled in a health plan through either a state or federal exchange and, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 8 of every 10 people qualified for the financial assistance provided under the Affordable Care Act.

The federal subsidies are available to individuals with incomes up to $42,000 – and families of four up to $94,000 – but you can’t get them unless you enroll through an exchange. (This site provides a calculator that can help people determine how much financial help they might be eligible for.)

The very bad news is that if you miss the March 31 deadline, you will only be able to enroll in a plan for 2014 through an Obamacare exchange if you experience a significant life change, such as getting married or losing your job. If you remain uninsured, you may be liable for a penalty of up to 1 percent of your income.

Avoid ‘buyers’ remorse’

Enrolling in a health plan is much easier than it used to be, but it’s still not as easy as ordering a book from Amazon.com. You’ll have to plug in information about yourself (and you family, if applicable), and you’ll have to sort through what in some states can be a bewildering array of choices.

Premiums vary based on how much you’re willing to pay out of your own pocket if you get sick or injured. Platinum- and Gold-level plans have higher premiums than Silver and Bronze plans, but they cover a greater percentage of medical costs.

A lot of people undoubtedly are making decisions based only on the amount of the monthly premium and giving little consideration to what they’ll have to shell out if they have to be admitted to the hospital or undergo expensive outpatient treatment. That can prove to be a costly mistake. I’m already hearing from people who wished they had spent more time evaluating their options.

One such person is Donna Smith, a cancer survivor and executive director of Health Care for All Colorado Foundation, who told me that in retrospect, she should have called the insurance companies she was considering to figure out more precisely how much money she’d have to pay on her own if she got sick again. Sure enough, right after the first of this year when the policy she selected last fall went into effect, she was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo a series of tests.

Smith said it hadn’t occur to her that picking a Gold or Platinum level plan with a higher premium could have been better deal than the Silver Kaiser Permanente plan she opted for and that seemed to be more affordable.

After her stay in the hospital, however, she found out some limitations of her coverage that made her overall financial responsibility much higher. For one thing, hospitalization under her plan required a co-insurance payment of 30 percent. She said that if she had shopped more carefully, she would have discovered that there were other Silver plans that required a co-insurance payment for inpatient care of only 20 percent.

“In retrospect,” she said, “I needed to ask much more detailed questions about the coverage. I believe now that I would have done better with one of the Gold Kaiser plans that might have cost another $150 to $200 per month but saved me from these higher costs of getting sick.”

Plenty of help available

One of the things to keep in mind is that help is available. It’s not just you and your computer. If you are uncertain about the choices you see online, you by all means should contact one of the specially trained Obamacare navigators in your area or a licensed agent or broker.

Rachel DeGolia, a Cleveland, Ohio-based navigator, says many people who seek her help, especially people who’ve been uninsured for a long time, have a very limited understanding of how health insurance works.

“It’s a big learning curve,” she said.

One of the things she helps many people with is helping them determine if their doctor or a specific hospital is in the network of a health plan they are considering. The plans offered by many health insurers have what is referred to as “narrow networks,” meaning the list of doctors and other health care providers and facilities available to health plan enrollees can be very limited.

“The narrow networks can be a problem,” DeGolia said. “You really hate to break people up with their doctors.”

She said it’s easier to determine if a hospital is in a network than a doctor. She and her fellow navigators have access to a grid showing which hospitals are in which health plan networks. No such grid exists for doctors, however.

“We can’t figure out if doctor is in plan or not,” she said. “You either have to call the doctor or call the plan itself, and even some doctors’ staff might not even know.”

One of the things navigators cannot do by law is make specific recommendations. They can’t tell you that one plan might be a better value than any other plan. They are limited to providing education and information.

Knowing that, you might want to consider contacting a licensed insurance agent or broker – and one that belongs to the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) – before making your final selection of a health plan.

As NAHU, which represents more than 100,000 health insurance professionals, points out on its website, before deciding which policy is best for you or you and your family, you need to consider a number of factors, such as the scope of what you want to cover, your degree of risk toleration, the network of medical providers available, and the monthly cost.

Unlike a navigator, a licensed agent can explain the benefits and potential shortcomings of various plans and help you pick a plan that best fits your needs. One of the reasons for making certain that the agent you talk with is a member is NAHU, by the way, is that as part of their membership, NAHU members agree to abide by a code of ethics that requires them to make health care coverage recommendations with the customer’s best interest in mind. NAHU points out that while agents receive commissions from insurance carriers, the commissions cover “not only the selling of the plan but much of the servicing required” after the sale-“so service after the sale…is just as important as the sale itself.”

Bottom line: If you still haven’t enrolled in a health plan, don’t procrastinate any longer. It might take more than a few minutes in front of your computer to find a plan that best meets your needs. And it might be in your best financial interest to contact a navigator and very possibly a licensed insurance agent or broker in your state.###1722||IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN

Sbarro’s, the pizza chain for hungry travelers and mall shoppers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, its second time in less than three years.

Sbarro’s and its affiliates have between $100 million and $500 million in debt, according to court filings. The company previously filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was working its way out of debt.

In February, the New York-based pizza chain said it was closing more than 150 stores nationwide in a bid to improve its finances. The company faces a problem plaguing many retailers: dwindling mall traffic. Many of its stores are located in shopping-center food courts.

The number of people shopping at malls has dropped during the past decade as Americans increasingly shop online. Earlier this year, RadioShack, Staples, J.C. Penney and Macy’s announced that they were closing locations around the country.

Sbarro’s, including franchises, has more than 1,000 locations in 45 countries. The chain opened its first location in Brooklyn in 1956.###1724||Mt. Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange that late last month filed for bankruptcy protection, updated its website on Tuesday to allow customers to log in and verify their wallet, or account, balance.

The website, which went blank just over three weeks ago, had previously posted occasional updates on Mt. Gox's civil rehabilitation process - a legal procedure that may allow Mt. Gox to rebuild and pay back some of its creditors - as well as a warning that some spam or phishing emails purporting to be from the exchange were in circulation.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February, saying it may have lost 850,000 bitcoins - worth around £313 million at current prices - to hackers.

A spokesperson reached via a helpline for Mt. Gox creditors confirmed that Mt. Gox set up the log-in, based on the last available data from the exchange's servers before they shut down.

Leaked information from various hacking attacks on Mt. Gox servers and CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog and Reddit account have been released in recent weeks, and one file purporting to be the company's internal database contained malware that could steal bitcoins once downloaded.

Besides the log-in option, the Mt. Gox homepage carried a statement in English and Japanese saying: "Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by Mt. Gox of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users."###1725||Colorado has collected $2m in marijuana taxes since it became the first US state to legalise the drug for commercial sales.

Figures reveal the state's 59 marijuana firms made $14m (£8.4m) in gross sales in January, the first month under the new laws.

Colorado legalised cannabis in 2012 but commercial sales did not begin until January, when 24 recreational pot shops were opened.

In total, the state collected a total of $3.5m in marijuana taxes if medicinal marijuana firms are included.

Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said the cash would be ploughed into youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment and public health.

There are currently 20 US states, including Washington, DC, which allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold.

Barack Obama recently told New Yorker magazine he did not think marijuana was more dangerous than alcohol but still thought it was a "bad idea".

But the President has instructed the Department of Justice to stop banks that do business with cannabis firms being prosecuted.

Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.###1726||You are using an older browser version.

Why now you ask? Because Bitcoin has lost perhaps the most important element of what a credible currency requires – trust.

Currencies are used for several reasons and perhaps their most import function is as a medium of exchange to trade goods and services. But where Bitcoin fails most is in another of its core functions – its ability to be used as a store of value. Investors need a currency to be a safe and secure means to store and protect the value of their wealth. What investors really need with a currency is price stability – the inverse of volatility. They want its value to remain reasonably constant and perhaps this is where Bitcoin fails the most. Its incredible volatility makes it scare off any sensible investor who understands the simple logic that the price of a Bitcoin can go down just as easily as it goes up.

Perhaps the greatest irony of Bitcoin is that its momentous rise in value may well have caused its very downfall. It rose too much, too quickly. Speculators joined the fun and pushed it to crazy levels. Its rise in value caused volatility, which made Bitcoin vulnerable to significant downside risk.

Bitcoin is the ultimate example of investors suffering from “greater fool theory”. The theory goes that the price of a tradable asset goes up based on irrational expectations of market participants, and not based on its intrinsic value. The only way “fools” buy such an asset is because they expect to resell it at a higher value to a “greater fool”. This bubble continues to inflate until such time as the market runs out of fools. When there are no more fools around to buy the asset, the price implodes in spectacular fashion.

This is not the first such instrument to have been bought in such a speculative manner. The tulip bulb mania and IT dot com bubble are two of the more well known ones, but the history of financial markets is full of speculative bubbles where participants drove the price of assets to exorbitant levels. So the Bitcoin phenomenon is not the first and certainly won’t be the last.

In certain respects, Bitcoin is really just 21st century gold. But instead of miners working in physical mines, computer hackers work with computers to “mine” for Bitcoins. And the similarities don’t stop there – the greatest advocates of Bitcoins are the very same people who complain about the US dollar and the American economy. Buy Bitcoins because “the US dollar is worthless and doomed to failure” they say. It’s a rather strange irony that these people trust an unknown founder with an unknown history more than they do the world’s most powerful nation with a concrete central bank overseeing its money supply.

And while the purist ideal of an internet-based monetary instrument – not backed by the many developed market and over-indebted nations of the world – is a rather sweet and novel concept, the main reason why I am convinced that it is doomed to failure is because there is no confidence or surety with Bitcoin. For all its weaknesses, the US dollar is backed by the world’s strongest economy and the largest central bank in the world. America is a working, growing economy that produces a quarter of the world’s GDP. It is trustworthy.

The same cannot be said about Bitcoin. From the sudden closure of the Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, to the evaporation of millions of dollars of Bitcoins, to the attempts to hack its systems and then the recent news of the obscurity of its founder, the trust in Bitcoin has all but dissipated. There is no stability in its price. There is no company or country backing its value. It’s really just a rather speculative bubble that will most likely eventually pop, if it has not already done so.

19:48, 19 OCT 2018###1733||Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox suffered about 150,000 hacking attacks per second for several days before its collapse last month, according to a report.

Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the exchange was hit by continued distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, during which hackers take control of computers to send large amount of data to a target, resulting in servers to crash.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many bitcoins were stolen from Mt. Gox, according to the newspaper.

Mt Gox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to DDoS attacks. The company has filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.

The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, £38m, €46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.

Problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers reportedly manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins.

Known as "transaction malleability", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.

The exchange's collapse questioned the reliability of bitcoin that suffered a plunge in prices subsequently.

Separate investigations are underway in Japan and the US against Mt. Gox.

UK-based law firm Selachii said earlier that more than 400 people are willing to join a class action in London against Mt. Gox and its owners.

Bitcoin was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. They can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, reducing fees involved in the services significantly.

The digital currency gained more popularity and value as more and more merchants started accepting bitcoins, boosting investors' morale.

However, a number of adverse incidents including the Mt. Gox debacle questioned the digital currency's reliability.

Governments across the globe have made different decisions regarding businesses related to bitcoin. While some have banned all dealings in the currency, some others have come up with pro-active policies that consider bitcoin firms just like any other tax-compliant companies.###1734||Obama noted, however, that the larger question is whether the risk pool is diverse enough to ensure premiums don't skyrocket, since “the more you can spread the risk with more people, the better deal you're going to get.”

In an interview with WebMD, Obama said the fact that 4.2 million people have signed up meant enough companies will be invested to stay in the system.

President Obama on Friday said he was confident enough Americans had enrolled under the Affordable Care Act to make the program “stable.”

The Obama administration is again extending a temporary Obamacare program insuring some of the sickest patients in the country amid concerns that not enough people will find new coverage by the end of the month.

People enrolled in the temporary Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, which was set to expire March 31, can purchase an extra month of coverage, the Obama administration said this afternoon. The PCIP program covers people who traditionally had trouble affording or finding individual insurance because of a medical condition.

The White House is standing by the March 31 deadline for enrollment, but the administration's announcement shows that officials are carving out more exceptions to it.

“As part of our continuing effort to help smooth consumers' transition into Marketplace coverage, we are allowing those covered by PCIP additional time to shop for new coverage while they receive the ongoing care and treatment they need,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement.

The extension is available to PCIP enrollees who have not yet enrolled in another health plan. They have until April 15 to enroll in new coverage that starts May 1.

The Obama administration said it wanted to avoid a possible lapse in coverage for PCIP patients, who include many people getting treatment for diseases like cancer and diabetes. About 21,000 people are still in the program, according to enrollment figures updated today.

This marks the third extension of the Affordable Care Act's $5 billion high-risk pool program, which under the health care law was supposed to sunset at the end of 2013. In mid-December, CMS extended the program until January. A month later, CMS said it would keep the high-risk pools open through March 31.

The ACA program, started in 2010, was meant to serve as a transition to 2014, when insurers can no longer deny people coverage based on a pre-existing condition or charge them more for it.

Enrollment in the program was lower than expected, but the administration struggled with low funding. CMS suspended new enrollment in February 2013 in order to pay for existing members. About 100,000 were enrolled in PCIP plans.###1735||Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a steady open on Tuesday, as investors remained cautious after the release of disappointing economic data in China over the weekend continued to weigh on market sentiment.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.05% dip, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.07% loss, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.01% gain.

Markets were still jittery after data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

The telecom sector was expected to be active, after SoftBank President Masayoshi Son said he is ready to start a "massive price war" if U.S. regulators allow Sprint Corp. to purchase T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint shares edged up 0.11% in after-hour trade.

Among auto stocks, General Motors dipped 0.03% pre-market as a U.S. House panel was set to investigate U.S. regulators and the company's response to consumer complaints about ignition-switch failures that led to the recall of 1.6 million vehicles and are linked to at least 13 deaths.

Elsewhere, Qualcomm Inc. shares were down 0.29% in extended trade after the provider of mobile-phone chips promoted Derek Aberle to president, naming a second-in-command to new Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf.

In the retail sector, Urban Outfitters Inc. plummeted 2.69% in late trading after saying it expects poor weather to contribute to lower sales and profit margins in the first quarter.

Citi upgraded J.C. Penney to "buy" with a price target of $11, sending shares in the department store chain up 4.04% in early trading.

Other stocks likely to be in focus included Dick's Sporting Goods and American Eagle Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.

Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dipped 0.04%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.29%, Germany's DAX added 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.41%.

Investing.com - The economic calendar for the week ending March 21 contains reports on the U.S. housing sector, inflation and factory activity, but the main event that investors will be focusing on is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, concluding on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the euro zone is to produce what will be closely watched data on inflation. Here are the main events to watch out for:

Federal Open Market Committee Meeting

This will be the first Federal Reserve board meeting with Janet Yellen at the helm. Investors expect the Fed to continue to taper its bond purchasing program by $10 billion to $55 billion, despite recent weak U.S. economic reports. The central bank is also expected to hold interest rates at record lows.

The Fed meeting is to be followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen and the bank is also to publish its forecasts on inflation and economic growth.

U.S. inflation report

The U.S. inflation report is due to be published on Tuesday. U.S. inflation has remained at a very low level in recent years, allowing leeway for the Federal Reserve to hold the benchmark interest rate close to zero.

Euro zone inflation report

The euro zone is to release official data on the annual rate of inflation on Monday, amid concerns over deflationary pressures. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday the strong euro was dragging down inflation, indicating growing concerns that the appreciation of the euro could undermine the fragile recovery in the euro area. The annual rate of inflation in the euro area came in at 0.8% in February, well below the ECB'S target of just under 2%.

U.S. housing sector data

On Tuesday the U.S. is to release official data on building permits and housing starts. This will be followed by a private sector report on existing home sales on Thursday. Housing starts dropped 16% in January as a result of severe winter weather, while building permits fell 4.6%. Weather conditions remained bad in February, so forecasters are expecting only a moderate rebound of 3.4% for housing starts in February.

German ZEW

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research is to publish its report on German economic sentiment on Tuesday. The index deteriorated slightly in February amid concerns that the economic recovery in the U.S. is losing momentum and forecasters expect the index to continue to tick lower this month.

New Zealand GDP

New Zealand is to publish data on fourth quarter gross domestic product on Wednesday. Last week, the New Zealand dollar rallied to 10-month highs against the greenback after the Reserve Bank raised interest rates to 2.75% from a record low 2.5%, becoming the first developed nation to exit record-low borrowing costs. The bank also revised up its forecast for growth in the year to March 31.###1738||Azerbaijani health officials say three members of an Iranian ship crew have died and another eight have been hospitalized with acute poisoning###1739||Empty###1740||Hong Kong may have lost out on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s listing to New York, but Chinese technology companies continue to come to the city.

Considerable weakness overseas is weighing on Wall Street, with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day.

Concerns about economic growth in China and the situation in Ukraine have also generated some negative sentiment, although activity seems somewhat subdued amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.

Nonetheless, brokerage stocks have shown another notable move to the downside, with the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index falling by 1.2 percent. The index is pulling back further off last Friday's nearly six-year closing high.

Significant weakness has also emerged among housing stocks, as reflected by the 1.1 percent loss being posted by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. With the drop, the index has fallen to its lowest intraday level in a month.

Tobacco, telecom, and chemical stocks are also seeing early weakness, while gold stocks are moving sharply higher amid a jump by the price of the precious metal.

* Two rival bids for SFR, France’s No. 2 telecom group

* Vivendi wants to cut telecom exposure to focus on media

* Faces tough choice between Numericable, Bouygues bids

* Board meeting to weigh offers set for Friday

By Leila Abboud and Gwénaëlle Barzic

PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - The traditional shoppers’ warning is caveat emptor, or “buyer beware”. When Vivendi’s board meets on Friday to choose between two bids for its French telecom unit SFR, “seller beware” may be more appropriate.

Both offers - from conglomerate Bouygues and local cable operator Numericable - leave Vivendi with a significant minority stake in the newly-created operator and continued exposure to the French telecom market, which has been in the throes of a price war since 2012.

Complicating matters further, Bouygues’ bid has garnered support from an outspoken industry minister who says it better serves France’s interests, as well as the backing of the other telecom companies - leader Orange and low-cost challenger Iliad - which would benefit from taking the mobile market back down to three from four players.

So will Vivendi’s board members - led by veteran chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou and his chosen successor, tycoon Vincent Bollore - be able to drown out the noise and decide what is best for the group and its shareholders?

The two men agreed last year to split off SFR by this summer as the final move in a two-year effort to slim down Vivendi and refocus it on its media businesses. The move led Numericable and Bouygues to come in with competing bids for SFR.

Vivendi is still sure it wants to exit telecoms as quickly as possible, said a person familiar with its thinking.

There is no sign that the brutal competition touched off by the arrival of Iliad and its Free Mobile brand is abating. Core operating profit at SFR halved from 2011 levels to 1.07 billion euros ($1.48 billion) last year and Vivendi took a 2.4 billion euro writedown on the business in February.

But the multiple factors at play - including potentially long antitrust reviews and the bid structure with a portion paid in shares - mean the choice between Numericable and Bouygues will not be easy, said three people close to the group.

Vivendi could also still decide to stick with its original plan to spin off SFR, the people said.

“It’s going to be very close,” one said of the decision.

Two of them also said they feared Bouygues’ effort to head off antitrust concerns by agreeing to sell 15,000 mobile antennas and a chunk of spectrum to Iliad could backfire by creating a “super-charged” Free Mobile that would gore the future profits of SFR-Bouygues.

“Anything that makes Xavier Niel so happy should worry us,” said the second person, referring to Iliad’s billionaire founder who has thrown his weight behind Bouygues’ bid.

As of Tuesday, Vivendi saw the Bouygues and Numericable bids as being roughly even financially, the third person said.

It also believes both deals would have to go through an in-depth antitrust review in France that can take around nine months, the first person said, although the Bouygues bid could take longer to review because it would create the country’s biggest mobile operator with 42 percent market share.

Vivendi has given the two sides until Wednesday night to submit any changes or final improvements to their bids.

Bouygues has offered Vivendi 10.5 billion euros in cash and a 46 percent stake in new the company, while Numericable has offered 10.9 billion euros and a 32 percent stake. Both promise massive cost savings from the tie-ups - Bouygues 10 billion euros and Numericable anywhere from 6 to 12 billion euros - which would flow in part to Vivendi if achieved.

Numericable backer Patrick Drahi told Les Echos on Wednesday that he would not raise his bid. Bouygues declined to comment.

A CLOSE RACE

Henri Lachmann, former CEO of Schneider Electric and administrator at Vivendi since 1998, is in charge of a four-person committee that is now preparing a recommendation for the full board. The 14-member board is set to meet on Friday.

A significant factor weighing in Numericable’s favour is that Vivendi would get a quicker, less risky exit from telecoms because Numericable shares are already listed, said two of the people. Soon after antitrust approval was secured, Vivendi could begin reducing its stake depending on any lock-up periods.

If Vivendi accepts the Bouygues offer, the earliest it could start to reduce its stake would be mid-2015 after an initial public offering of the combined entity.

In this scenario, Bouygues Telecom would be spun out from conglomerate Bouygues, merged with SFR, and then listed. It carries with it risks not only because stock market conditions are unpredictable, but also because SFR-Bouygues’ results could worsen by then, making Vivendi’s 46 percent worth less.

But insiders cautioned against thinking Numericable was the favourite just because it held out the promise of a quicker exit for Vivendi. The board is wary of another ill-considered decision on SFR after buying out British group Vodafone’s minority stake in 2011 - six months before Iliad came on the scene - for what now looks like a hefty price.

“It’s more complex than just choosing what seems like the simpler option,” said the first person, adding that governance, synergies and political factors would be taken into account as well as the liquidity of Vivendi’s stake.

Also at play is whether Vivendi would prefer having Numericable’s founder Patrick Drahi or Bouygues patriarch Martin Bouygues as a long-term partner.

“Some people favour Drahi and some prefer Bouygues. The debate is still going on,” the person added.###1743||Empty###1744||Empty###1745||Empty###1746||Empty###1747||The complex financial manoeuvre will create the effect of a two-for-one stock split and dramatically reduce the voice of Google's common shareholders

But it will also change how the company is reflected in the value of the popular S&P 500 index. The share price will be cut in half from Wednesday's lofty per-share level of $1,207.30 , but investors will see their ability to have a say in the company greatly reduced.

The changes kick off on April 2, when Google will, using newly created class C stock, pay a dividend to existing holders of the company's class A and class B shares. The new class C shares will carry no voting rights, making them unusual relative to the common shares issued by most companies.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has reversed course on the way it will deal with the situation in the S&P 500. Originally, the index provider was going to replace Google's class A shares in the index with class C. But late Tuesday, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would include both the class A and the class C shares, meaning the S&P 500 will now have 501 stocks in it, representing 500 companies.###1748||BEIJING â€” Common interests between China and the United States far outweigh the countries' differences, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday, sounding a cordial note following a minor spat over President Barack Obama's recent meeting with the Dalai Lama.

Li told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further "unleash the potential" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.

He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."

"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.

Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.

Relations between China and the U.S. have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.

Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.

China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the U.S., while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.

However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.

###1749||A big drop in China exports has the commodity complex fearing demand destruction drops more than geo-political risk. Forget about Ukraine, Libya, a strong U.S. Jobs report or the possibility of a terrorist blowing up a Jet from Malaysia, it is about China in the early trade.

Chinese exports plunged tanked by a shocking 18.1% leading to a 23 billion dollar trade deficit. The markets are trying to adjust to a shaky new Lunar New Year. Oh, sure, some blame the holiday but after getting one China company default it is possible that China is headed towards a very hard landing.

The reason why this is so shocking is just one month ago China trade expanded by 10.6%. We saw copper imports were soaring. Still China Copper Imports were up January through February was up 41.2% but in February fell 29%.

China's consumer prices rose 2% in February at their slowest rate in 13 months. So it does give some room to stimulate if need be but one of the reason prices fell was pork prices fell by 9%. Pork prices are again on the rise as the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus is devastated the U.S. pig crop. Producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month by dropping 2%, slightly above forecasts for a 1.9% drop leading to more concerns that China is having a hard time keeping things together.

Add to that Japan revised down its growth estimate for the final three months of last year after announcing a record current account deficit for January. Japan's Cabinet Office said both private and public demand was lower than its earlier estimate.

Reuters is reporting that armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorized sale of oil from a rebel-held port. A North Korean-flagged tanker, the Morning Glory, docked on Saturday at the port of Es Sider and local daily al-Wasat said it had loaded $36 million of crude oil. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the military will bomb the 37,000-tonne vessel if it tries to leave.

Officials said on Sunday that the navy and pro-government militias had dispatched boats to stop it from getting out. The rebels said any attack on the tanker would be "a declaration of war." The escalating conflict over the country's oil wealth is a sign of mounting chaos in Libya, where the government has failed to rein in fighters who helped oust veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and who now defy state authority.

The protesters, who also include former soldiers and ex-oil guards led by a former anti-Gaddafi commander, Ibrahim Jathran, have seized three eastern ports in the OPEC member country. The Defense Ministry issued orders to the chief of staff, air force and navy to deal with the tanker.###1750||With just two weeks until the “Obamacare” deadline for Americans to get health insurance or possibly face a tax penalty, enrollment specialist Kristi Scott has some advice for her fellow Montanans: Don’t wait until the last minute.###1751||Empty###1752||Empty###1753||Empty###1754||Just because it was the 25th birthday of the World Wide Web yesterday doesn't mean you should go and buy some tech stocks as a gift (though it would be a nice gesture).

Factions of Libya's government voted to oust current Prime Minister Ali Zeidan after his leadership failed to stop eastern rebels from independently exporting oil abroad, according to Reuters and Agence France Presse.

"The parliamentary factions are meeting. There is a consensus on bringing down the government. We are going to put it to the vote shortly. The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," MP Suad Gannur told AFP.

According to Al Arabiya News, Zeidan will be replaced temporarily by the defense minister.

Zeidan's government has received extensive criticism from both the parliament and the public for its failure to calm chaos and control rebel militias throughout the restive North African country since taking office after the oust of former dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The latest showcase of his leadership failure was the ability for eastern rebel groups to use a ship called The Morning Glory to independently export at least 234,000 barrels of crude. The vessel managed to escape to sea from Al Sidra earlier Tuesday even after Zeidan's government threatened arm action and air strikes to keep the tanker from reaching international waters.

Zeidan, who was also previously abducted himself by rebel militias, has faced motions in parliament to resign in previous months. However, the General National Congress did not achieve the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members in the pass to implement the motion accordingly.###1757||Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: URBN) is up more than one percent in after-hours trading after the company released its fourth quarter results.

The firm reported a Q4 EPS of $0.59 versus the Street estimate of $0.55.

Vodafone said on Monday it expected to achieve cost and capital expenditure savings of approximately 240 million euros, before integration costs, by the fourth full year after completion.

The deal for the private equity-owned group is Vodafone’s third purchase of a European fixed-broadband asset in two years as the company seeks to improve its networks and shore up its European businesses after they were hit by fierce competition, the recession and regulatory cuts.

Vodafone has launched a program to invest in its networks, and acquire assets where necessary, after selling its US arm for $130 billion last year.

A 7.2 billion-euro price tag implies a multiple of 10.4 times the group’s operating free cash flow, broadly in line with recent deals in the European cable and telecoms sector.

“The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone,” Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said.

* Says won’t need capital increase, to cut 8,500 jobs

* Bank says to list Fineco unit, to issue additional Tier 1 bond

* Shares up 6 percent on balance sheet clean-up (Adds job cuts, internal bad bank, bonds, CEO’s comments, 2014 profit target)

By Silvia Aloisi and Gianluca Semeraro

MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit posted a record 14 billion-euro ($19 billion) loss on Tuesday due to huge writedowns on bad loans and past acquisitions as it moved to clean up its balance sheet ahead of an industry-wide health check by European regulators.

Italy’s biggest bank by assets said full-year provisions against losses from loans totalled 13.7 billion euros in 2013, with 9.3 billion euros in the fourth quarter alone.

“This is a jaw-dropping clean-up,” said one banking analyst, who declined to be named. “The company is taking 9.3 billion euros of loan losses. We had (forecast) 4.5 billion euros and thought we were high.”

Yet UniCredit shares rallied after an initial drop, as the bank said it did not need to carry out a capital increase and felt it had done more than will be required to get a clean bill of health by regulators when the European Central Bank conducts its asset quality review of the euro zone’s 128 biggest banks.

UniCredit’s share price was up 7 percent at 6.46 euros by 1604 GMT, its highest level since October 2011 and extending gains this year to 20.3 percent, compared with a 4 percent rise in the Stoxx Europe 600 banking sector index.

“I believe the group has turned the page. We could have staggered the losses over several years. We decided to take them all in one year,” Chief Executive Federico Ghizzoni told reporters.

In addition to the bad loan provisions the bank also booked in goodwill impairments totalling 9.3 billion euros as it effectively wrote down the entire value of its acquisitions since 2005.

That year UniCredit became a major force in Europe through the purchase of Germany’s HypoVereinsbank and its extensive operations in Central and Eastern Europe.

The massive net loss, one of the worst suffered by a European bank since the beginning of the financial crisis, was partly mitigated by a 1.2 billion-euro net capital gain recorded for the revaluation of UniCredit’s stake in the Bank of Italy, whose accounting treatment is still under discussion.

Analysts had on average expected the bank to report a net profit of 916.5 million euros in 2013, up from the net profit of 865 million euros reported for 2012, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates.

KITCHEN SINKING

The bank also launched a restructuring plan on Tuesday which aims for 8,500 job cuts by 2018 - nearly 6 percent of its workforce - for which it took a 700 million-euro charge in the fourth quarter.

In addition it will create an internal “bad bank” to manage 87 billion euros of bad and risky loans. These will be reduced to 33 billion euros in the next five years, Ghizzoni said.

The bank will also list a minority stake in its online unit Fineco, issue so-called additional Tier 1 bonds and will propose a scrip dividend of 0.10 euros a share for 2013, payable in shares, to further boost its capital.

“Investors are looking favourably at the kitchen sinking, and how they cleaned up the balance sheet through large loan loss charges, because it allows them to draw a line and move on,” said Alberto Gallo, credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.

UniCredit, which unveiled its 2013-2018 business plan along with the results, said it was targeting a net profit of around 2 billion euros for 2014 and an ambitious return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 13 percent in 2018.

Ghizzoni said his hopes for a quick turnaround were based on signs that economic activity in UniCredit’s Italian home base was picking up after two and half years of recession.

“For the first time in January we saw a decline in the stock (of bad debts) for corporates,” he said, adding that the bank’s targets were based on prudent economic forecasts for Italy, where UniCredit makes 40 percent of its revenues.

The bank said that after the clean-up, its impaired loan coverage ratio of 52 percent was the highest in Italy and one of the best in Europe.

UniCredit also said its fully-loaded Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio, a closely-watched measure of a bank’s financial strength, stood at 9.4 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of 2013.

That will rise by 0.3 percentage points once the Fineco listing and other capital boosting moves are completed, the bank said, putting it well above an 8 percent minimum requirement set by the ECB, despite the heavy writedowns.

Analyzing data from the seven states that have published their enrollment figures, Kaiser researchers found that some states, such as California and New York, have much more competitive insurance markets than they did before the exchanges opened. But other state markets, including Connecticut and Washington, are actually less competitive than they were a year ago.

"There are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest [now] were the biggest before," Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, told Bloomberg.

In California, for example, Anthem Blue Cross previously held 47 percent of the market for private plans in 2012, which dropped to 30 percent in the state's online marketplace. That's a change from an analysis in January that found insurers in California had largely held onto their market share.

New York's Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield comprised 28 percent of the market in 2012, but that share has lowered to 18 percent on the exchange this year. And of the 16 insurers selling individual policies on the state exchange, seven have more than a 5 percent market share.

Among states with less competitive markets, just three insurers are selling plans on Connecticut's exchange. WellPoint dominates the market with a 60 percent share. EmblemHealth has 37 percent of the market and HealthyCT has just 3 percent. And Washington's Premera Blue Cross controls 62 percent of the exchange market, compared with its 40 percent market share in 2012.

But WellPoint spokeswoman Kristin Binn told Bloomberg that the report isn't representative of all markets and shouldn't lead to widespread conclusions because, for example, the data doesn't include members whose plans were renewed from prior years or new members who signed up without using exchanges.

KUALA LUMPUR/WASHINGTON – Satellites picked up faint electronic pulses from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 after it went missing on Saturday, but the signals gave no information about where the stray jet was heading and little else about its fate, two sources close to the investigation said on Thursday.

But the "pings" indicated its maintenance troubleshooting systems were switched on and ready to communicate with satellites, showing the aircraft, with 239 people on board, was at least capable of communicating after losing touch with air traffic controllers.

The system transmits such pings about once an hour, according to the sources, who said five or six were heard. However, the pings alone are not proof that the plane was in the air or on the ground, the sources said.

An international search for the 777, which left Kuala Lumpur early Saturday bound for Beijing, involves at least a dozen countries. Ships and aircraft are now combing a vast area that has been widened to cover the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea and on both sides of the Malay Peninsula.

The United States, which has sent ships and planes, said the search area may soon expand into the Indian Ocean, consistent with the theory that the plane may have detoured to the west about an hour after take-off from the Malaysian capital.

"It’s my understanding that based on some new information that’s not necessarily conclusive – but new information – an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington.

India’s defence ministry has already ordered the deployment of ships, aircraft and helicopters from the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 1,190 km (740 miles) east of Chennai, at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.

The Indian armed forces will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide how to coordinate their search efforts with other countries that are participating, a senior command officer said.

An Indian P8I Poseidon surveillance plane was sent to the Andaman islands on Thursday, ready to join the search once cleared, the head of India’s Andaman and Nicobar air force command, Air Marshal P.K Roy, said on Thursday.

The U.S. Navy was sending an advanced P-8A Poseidon to help search the Strait of Malacca, separating the Malay Peninsula from the Indonesian Island of Sumatra. It had already deployed a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft to those waters.

U.S. defense officials later told Reuters that the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, USS Kidd, was en route to Strait of Malacca, answering a request from the Malaysian government. The Kidd had been searching the areas south of the Gulf of Thailand, along with the destroyer USS Pinckney.

LITTLE FRESH LIGHT

The new information about signals heard by satellites shed little light on the mystery of what happened to the plane, whether it was a technical failure, a hijacking or another kind of incident on board.

While the troubleshooting systems were functioning, no data links were opened, the sources said, because the companies involved had not subscribed to that level of service from the satellite operator, the sources said.

Boeing Co, which made the missing 777 airliner, and Rolls-Royce, which supplied its Trent engines, declined to comment.

Earlier Malaysian officials denied reports that the aircraft had continued to send technical data and said there was no evidence that it flew for hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers early Saturday.

The Wall Street Journal had reported that U.S. aviation investigators and national security officials believed the Boeing 777 flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from its engines as part of a standard monitoring program.

Malaysian authorities have said the last civilian contact occurred as the Boeing 777-200ER flew north into the Gulf of Thailand. They said military radar sightings indicated the plane may have turned sharply to the west and crossed the Malay Peninsula toward the Andaman Sea.

It is one of the most baffling mysteries in the history of modern aviation – there has been no trace of the plane since nor any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of over a dozen countries across Southeast Asia.

"It’s extraordinary that with all the (satellite and telecommunication) technology that we’ve got that an aircraft can disappear like this," Tony Tyler, the head of the International Air Transport Association that links over 90 percent of the world’s airlines, told reporters in London.

WRONG IMAGES

On the sixth day of the search, planes scanned an area of sea where Chinese satellite images had shown what could be debris but found no sign of the airliner.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference the images were provided accidentally, saying the Chinese government neither authorised nor endorsed putting them on a website. "The image is not confirmed to be connected to the plane," he said.

It was the latest in a series of contradictory reports, adding to the confusion and agony of the relatives of the passengers, about two-thirds of whom were Chinese.

As frustration mounted over the failure to find any trace of the plane, China heaped pressure on Malaysia to improve coordination in the search.

Premier Li Keqiang, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, demanded that the "relevant party" step up coordination while China’s civil aviation chief said he wanted a "smoother" flow of information from Malaysia, which has come under heavy criticism for its handling of the disaster.

Indonesia and Thailand have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace.

Malaysian police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.

Two of the passengers on board were discovered by investigators to have false passports, but they were apparently seeking to emigrate illegally to the West.

The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 struck a seawall with its undercarriage on landing in San Francisco, killing three people.###1765||Empty###1766||In this photo provided by the U.S. Navy, crew members on board an aircraft P-8A Poseidon on Sunday, March 16, 2014, assist in search and rescue operations for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean.

By JOAN LOWY, Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — Finding a missing Malaysia Airlines plane may hinge on whether searchers can narrow down where they need to look using satellite data that is inexact and has never been used for that purpose before, search and rescue experts say.

Authorities now believe someone on board the Boeing 777 shut down part of the aircraft's messaging system about the same time the plane with 239 people on board disappeared from civilian radar. But an Inmarsat satellite was able to automatically connect with a portion of the messaging system that remained in operation, similar to a phone call that just rings because no one is on the other end to pick it up and provide information. No location information was exchanged, but the satellite continued to identify the plane once an hour for four to five hours after it disappeared from radar screens.

Based on the hourly connections with the plane, described by a U.S. official as a "handshake," the satellite knows at what angle to tilt its antenna to be ready to receive a message from the plane should one be sent. Using that antenna angle, along with radar data, investigators have been able to draw two vast arcs, or "corridors" — a northern one from northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. The plane is believed to be somewhere along those arcs.

Air crash investigators have never used this kind of satellite data before to try to find a missing plane, but after pursing other leads it's the best clue left.

"The people that are doing this are thinking outside the box. They're using something that wasn't designed to be used this way, and it seems to be working," said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona. "In terms of search and rescue, they're probably going to have rewrite the book after this."

Authorities generally believe the plane crashed into the ocean, although they can't rule out the possibility that it may be on land somewhere. Twenty-five countries are involved in the search for the plane, using at least 43 ships and 58 aircraft.

"If it really is out there in the Indian Ocean, they're going to need a lot more than that," Waldock said. "It's immense. It takes a lot of effort, a lot of people, a lot of ships and airplanes."

In order to narrow down the location, low-flying planes are searching broad swaths of water for any sign of debris. The search is complicated by the vast amount of trash floating in the world's oceans.

If the airliner did crash into the ocean, some lighter-weight items such as insulation, seat cushions, and life jackets, as well as bodies not strapped to seats, are likely to be floating on the surface, Waldock said. The heavier parts of the plane would sink, with depths in some parts of the Indian Ocean at over 15,000 feet, he said.

When suspected debris of a plane is found, the nearest ship — whether it's a search ship or a commercial vessel that happens to be in the area — is sent to the site. A small boat or life raft usually has to be lowered into the water for a closer look at the debris to judge whether it might have come from the missing plane.

If searchers find airplane debris, ocean currents will have already moved away from where the plane went into the water. Searchers will then have to use their knowledge of currents in the region to estimate how far and from what direction the debris came, and work backward to that location.

The airliner is equipped with two "black boxes" — a flight data recorder that contains hundreds of types of information on how the plane was functioning, and a cockpit voice recorder that contains pilots' conversations and noise in the cockpit. Both are equipped with underwater locator beacons, sometimes called "pingers," that emit a sonic signal that can only be heard underwater. Sonar on ships can sometimes pick up the pings, but they are best heard using a special pinger locator device that is lowered into the water.

The U.S. Navy in the Indian Ocean region has a pinger locator. "It's boxed up, it's ready to be sent somewhere," said a U.S. official. "Right now, there just isn't enough evidence to tell us where to send it."

The official agreed to speak only on condition anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly.

Commodities Mar 11, 2014 08:08PM ET

Investing.com - Gold prices were a tad stronger in early Asia trade on Wednesday, supported by continued tension in the Crimean region of the Ukraine.



On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,348.10 a troy ounce, up 0.10%, after hitting an overnight session low of $1,338.00 and off a high of $1,352.80.



Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Tuesday.



Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices.



Meanwhile, silver for May delivery traded at $20.930 a troy ounce, up 0.55%, while copper futures for May delivery gained 0.11% at $2.954 a pound, recovering from a slump earlier in the week.



Weak Chinese trade data earlier in the week bruised copper prices.



Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.



A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.



The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling, especially China, which consumes about 40% of the world's copper supply.

The deal is expected to be announced Monday and should get regulatory approval before summer, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. Thomas H. Lee Partners and Quadrangle Capital Partners, two private-equity firms together hold 54.4 percent of Ono, which added 9,000 Internet customers and 183,000 mobile subscriptions, but lost 17,000 cable TV customers in the fourth quarter of 2013.

“We are clearly interested in broadband in Spain; we are clearly interested in offering our own solutions,” Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s CEO, reportedly said in Barcelona last month, according to Bloomberg, and increased the offer to Ono from 6 billion euros on March 5 to 7 billion euros.

The deal will allow the British telecom major to compete with Spain’s Telefonica and French company, Orange, which also has reportedly started searching for more acquisitions in Spain. Last year, Vodafone sold its 45 percent stake in New York-based Verizon Wireless (NYSE:VZ) for $130 billion to focus on Europe and emerging markets.

In 2013, Ono’s earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization fell to 686 million euros, dropping 8.8 percent from the same period last year, according to the New York Times.

Vodafone had reportedly submitted a tentative offer for Ono last week, just before the latter's annual meeting after which the due diligence process began. Although Ono’s initial public offering got shareholders’ approval at the annual meeting, its board continued the discussion with Vodafone for a potential deal, New York Times reported, citing a source.

According to data from Thomson Reuters, deals in the last 12 months in the telecom sector, including Vodafone’s sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless, increased by four times to $194 billion.

French media reported last week that media conglomerate Vivendi may enter into negotiations with Altice, for its mobile arm, SFR, in a deal worth 11.75 billion euros, leading to a race between Altice and Bouygues Telecom to acquire SFR, according to the Times.###1769||As the deadline to buy insurance on the national health-care exchange fast approaches, resources are in place to help Missoula-area residents navigate the process.###1770||Empty###1771||FXStreet (Łódź) - Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said today in a speech delivered at the Bank of France alongside Governor Christian Noyer that he expected US unemployment to drop even lower than 6.2% by the end of the year.

Forget Crimea? Forget Crimea and bring on the Fed. While Vladimir Putin mocks Obama it seems that the markets want to forget about those risks and focus on the Fed and whether or not Janet Yellen can be tougher than the President. Janet’s first job is tried to rephrase their 6.5% jobs target and to send a signal that it is just not about a number but about a slew of data. We all know that the Fed relies that their jobs target of 6.5 percent before they would even think about raising interest rates is far from sufficient in an economy where the jobs that are being created are a far cry from the jobs that were lost. Stocks rallied hard after a big rebound in industrial production that perhaps the weakness we saw was energy related. Factories that had to interrupt their natural gas slowed production and now are playing catch up. While the market hopes this is a trend but it will assure us that the Fed will not waver from the taper. We know it will be tough to back off the 10 billion dollar taper but the real challenge may come when it is the right time to raise interest rates. Even more important may be when the Fed starts unwinding its ever growing balance sheet. Of course the Fed should start to admit that there are consequences to their actions and yes tapering is a form of tightening. If you don’t believe it, talk to the emerging markets who feel like the Federal Reserve left them hanging out to dry. As I have said before it seems the first steps in removing extraordinary stimulus may not be so painless after all. The global economies tried to keep a stiff upper lip but now is feeling pain as the Band-Aid starts to get ripped off. The Federal Reserve’s failure to acknowledge the emerging markets in its statement is hurting some feelings and some emerging market balance sheets. The Fed also failed to acknowledge that quantitative easing caused the emerging markets to blow bubbles and live beyond their means now have to deal with a world post hot money. Instead of dealing with the massive inflows as the US started to deleverage, they now have to deal with the outflows unmasking the ramifications of being the Fed’s economic dumping ground. Now the question is whether or not the Fed can continue to ignore the turmoil in the emerging markets and rely on our own rebounding economy or will it come back to haunt us. China of course is a reason why oil is faltering. Oil was getting weighed down led by RBOB and a rise in refining margins. OPEC is producing like crazy and wants to hang onto market share and maybe develop new customers that are being held hostage to a country that is using its energy advantage as a weapon to invade its neighbors.

* Central bank seeks to end one-way bets on currency appreciation

* Sharp decline unlikely given sizeable surplus, FX reserves

* Cbank likely to keep tight grip on mkt until nerves settle

By Lu Jianxin and Saikat Chatterjee

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - China’s yuan eased against the dollar on Monday after the central bank doubled the currency’s daily trading band as part of its commitment to let markets play a greater role in the economy.

Yet the currency moved in a relatively narrow range reflecting market views that the People’s Bank of China will seek to limit currency swings at a time when markets fret over China’s cooling growth and the quality of corporate debt.

“The PBOC, with the help of major state-owned banks, will for certain tighten the grip on yuan’s value in coming days and weeks to prevent what it sees excessive volatility,” said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai.

In the longer run, however, the central bank is expected to allow the currency to move in a broader range in a sign of its confidence that it can keep speculators at bay and that the economy was mature enough to handle greater uncertainty about the exchange rate.

“Over time, the widening will pave the way for the PBOC to gradually lessen intervention in daily trading and will help China’s reforms to make the yuan fully convertible eventually.”

On Saturday, the People’s Bank of China doubled the yuan’s daily trading range, so that it can now rise or fall 2 percent around the daily mid-point rate. The currency opened at 6.15 to the dollar, just 0.29 percent to the weaker side of the official mid-point rate. It briefly fell to an intraday low of 6.1642, 0.2 percent weaker than Friday’s close.

Since the start of this year the yuan has lost 1.8 percent against the dollar, largely as a result of the central bank’s efforts, reversing much of last year’s near 3 percent rise as Beijing sought to change the perception the yuan was a safe one-way appreciation bet.

Beijing’s efforts to clamp down on such trades combined with concerns over China’s economic health are expected to keep the yuan on the back foot in coming weeks.

LITTLE UPSIDE

Earlier this month, a Chinese company became the first to default on a corporate bond, and concerns about economic growth were highlighted by a dramatic 18 percent fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing.

“Given China’s recent relatively weak export performance, we see little upside for the yuan this coming year,” said Tao Wang, an economist at UBS in Hong Kong.

The Bank of International Settlements data underscore that point showing the yuan at a record high against a basket of currencies of China’s trading partners adjusted for inflation.

Yuan non-deliverable forwards, that reflect bets on future currency performance, are implying a nearly 1 percent drop over the next 12 months compared with half a percent fall in December.

But China will be careful to temper expectations of more yuan weakness to prevent capital outflows at a time when the economy is facing headwinds.

A series of weak economic surveys made some economists predict that Beijing will struggle to meet its 7.5 percent growth target this year, which it itself would be already the weakest in 24 years.

China’s new leadership has signalled greater tolerance for more pedestrian growth as the necessary price for its intended rebalancing away from rapid investment- and export-driven expansion towards more sustained development.

Giving markets more leeway in setting the exchange rate is part of a broad reform plan that also includes freeing up interest rates, allowing private investment in protected sectors and cutting red tape. But Beijing has also made clear it was ready to act if the economy lost traction too quickly to preserve economic and social stability.

RENMINBI TO RISE

However, in the longer run, the yuan could still find support in China’s sizeable current account surplus and its massive $3.8 trillion currency reserve war chest.

That also chimes in with Beijing’s efforts to boost the yuan’s use in international trade. In recent months, it has opened new offshore yuan hubs in London, Singapore and Taiwan and relaxed restrictions for investors seeking yuan assets.

More than a sixth of China’s trade is now denominated in the yuan compared to less than 1 percent four years ago and analysts expect this share to double over the next two to three years.

A band widening is also seen as a precursor to a fully floating currency which would be a big step towards the yuan, also referred to as renminbi, becoming an international reserve asset.

“Any short term weakness that may occur would provide investors a good opportunity to reallocate away from the currencies of more indebted countries in favour of the Renminbi,” said Andy Seaman, fund manager at London-based fixed income fund Stratton Street Capital.

Dealers said the central bank’s mid-point level fixed 0.04 percent firmer than Friday’s level and Monday’s opening trades suggested it was Beijing’s intention to keep markets guessing about where yuan would be heading.

“These rates are the first signs that the band widening may not point to any certain direction of yuan depreciation or appreciation,” said a dealer at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai.

Reflecting that heightened uncertainty, one-month implied dollar/yuan volatilities traded in the offshore market, perhaps the clearest indicator of how volatile the Chinese currency is expected to be over the next month, hit a record before easing slightly.###1774||China significantly weakens yuan

China's central bank weakened the daily reference rate for its currency by the largest percentage in more than a year and a half, continuing a push to drive the yuan lower.



As sluggish economic news sent jitters through the market, the People's Bank of China set the daily reference rate Monday at 6.1312 to the US dollar, compared with 6.1201 to the US dollar on Friday. The 0.18 per cent change represented the largest one-day move in the rate since July 2012.



The central bank determines the rate each day, and then allows the currency to trade as much as 1 per cent higher or lower. Since 2005, it has gradually moved the rate up, allowing the yuan to strengthen 33 per cent, but in the last month has pushed it lower, seeking to discourage speculators who have channeled money into the economy in hopes of benefiting from the currency's rise.



The US dollar-Chinese yuan pair was fixed "much higher than what the market environment would have otherwise suggested," said Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank in Hong Kong. This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago.



Mr Tihanyi says the move to set the yuan weaker isn't a reaction by policy makers to news Saturday that China recorded a rare trade deficit in February, but is an element of a broader effort by the central bank to overhaul the financial system. Beijing is seeking to make it clear to investors that the yuan isn't a one-way bet, laying the groundwork for allowing the currency to trade more freely.



Premier Li Keqiang said last week at the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative session, that Beijing would expand the currency-trading band.



The trade figures, as well as disappointing news about inflation released over the weekend, weren't surprising and reflect seasonal factors, analysts and strategists said. Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year. Imports, however, were up 10.1 per cent from a year earlier, pointing to undamaged Chinese demand.



"We aren't surprised by the trade deficit in February, as China used to record a deficit in February or March in recent years and we don't think there is a big chance China will post a deficit again in March," said Huang Yi, head of currencies and commodities of China Guangfa Bank.



Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming. The "two-way" movement will persist in the short run, he said.



Analysts note that volatility in the currency has risen dramatically over the past few weeks from record lows, after the yuan spooked market participants with an unexpected 1.3 per cent tumble in late February and early March. The yuan usually barely budges; it gained 2.9 per cent in all of 2013.



On Monday, the yuan touched 6.1458 against the dollar, compared with 6.1260 late Friday in New York. The offshore yuan, which is freely traded outside China, fell as low as 6.1309 from 6.1095 on Friday.



Some say while the weekend's economic news was a factor behind the decision to change the reference rate, Chinese policy makers have taken the news as an opportunity to prompt caution in the market and shake out speculators who have driven money into China.



"We expect that the trade figures will be more real in the coming months as the [yuan] has become much more volatile and less predictable than before," economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note on March 8. The gap, or spread, between interest rates in the onshore and offshore markets is narrowing, potentially deterring people from pumping money into mainland China to take advantage of high yields in the onshore market, they said.###1775||Empty###1776||Gold futures moved up for a third straight session to end at a six-month high on Wednesday, as investors opted for safe haven assets while tracking declining global equity with fears of slowing economic growth in China after some lackluster trade data last weekend. The ongoing standoff between Russia and the West over the Crimean region in Ukraine also contributed to the spike in gold prices.

The stalemate over Russia's involvement in the Crimean region continued with leaders of the Group of Seven cautioning against any attempt to annex Ukraine's Crimea region, indicating grave implications in the event Russia goes ahead with the move. The West has also demanded the referendum slated for Sunday be called off. The crucial referendum in Crimea seeks to get people's approval to enable the region merge with Russia, after the regional parliament voted unanimously to become part of Russia.

Gold was also supported by some dismal data from the eurozone, with industrial production declining unexpectedly in January due to the ongoing contraction in energy output, reflecting the fragile nature of economic recovery in the area.

Gold for April delivery, the most actively traded contract, surged $23.80 or 1.8 percent to close at $1,370.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.

Gold for April delivery scaled an intraday high of $1,371.30 and a low of $1,345.60 an ounce.

Yesterday, gold futures settled higher, after data on Saturday indicated the Chinese to be slowing more than initially estimated, with exports in February plummeting over 18 percent.

Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, remained unchanged at 812.70 tons from its previous close.

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against six major currencies, traded at 79.58 on Wednesday, down from its previous close of 79.79 late Tuesday in North American trade. The dollar scaled a high of 79.86 intraday and a low of 79.56.

The euro traded higher against the dollar at $1.3907 on Wednesday, as compared to its previous close of $1.3860 late Tuesday in North America. The euro scaled a high of $1.3913 intraday and a low of $1.3844.

In economic news, eurozone industrial output fell 0.2 percent month-on-month in January, which was the second consecutive drop, Eurostat said Wednesday. Economists expected production to expand 0.5 percent, after a revised 0.4 percent drop in December.

Sector-wise, energy production declined 2.5 percent as seen in December. Durable consumer goods output slipped 0.6 percent, in contrast to a 0.8 percent rise a month ago. Likewise, production of intermediate goods slipped 0.1 percent. Partially offsetting these declines, capital goods gained 0.9 percent and non-durable consumer goods rose 0.4 percent.

Market Analysis###1777||There are two Social Security strategies for couples that have generated a great deal of interest among financial planners in recent years: file and suspend and claim now, claim more later. While these strategies can generate greater lifetime benefits for recipients, what about the Social Security system? With the system being stressed by massive boomer retirements (some estimate 10,000 per day) and a trust fund projected to run out of funds sometime in the early 2030s, how great is the impact of these creative filing strategies? Before looking at this question, lets review the two strategies.

In file and suspend, the higher-wage earner files for benefits at age 66 in order to let the lower-wage-earner spouse start collecting spousal benefits. The higher-wage earner, however, immediately suspends his or her filing in order to accrue delayed retirement credits until age 70. This odd-sounding file-and-suspend strategy allows the lower-wage earner to collect one half of the higher-wage-earner benefits and lets the higher earner commence greatly enhanced benefits at age 70. This strategy primarily benefits couples where the higher-wage earner makes much more than the lower-wage earner. If their earnings histories are similar, there is little benefit to file and suspend.

In claim now, claim more later, the higher earner files a restricted Social Security claim for spousal benefits only, so that he or she can collect a spousal benefit based on the work history of the lower earner. Then, at 70, the higher-wage earner files for his or her own greatly enhanced benefit. This strategy provides an even greater benefit for the couples where earnings histories are similar, which is more often the case today.

The Social Security Administration funded research to look a range of issues, including the cost to the system of people using these planning strategies. This research was partially reported in an article that appeared in the Journal of Financial Planning in August 2013. The research found that the cost of the file and suspend strategy to the Social Security system is very small, only about $0.5 billion per year. For perspective, in 2012 the Social Security Administration paid out $645 billion in retirement benefits and the Social Security Trust Fund had over $2.8 trillion in savings at the end of 2013, according to the Social Security Administrations website.

This relatively small system cost of file and suspend may be attributed to two primary factors. File and suspend, for all the attention that it has garnered, provides only modestly enhanced benefits, less than $2,000 gains in lifetime benefits for a typical couple. Secondly, the strategy only benefits a small percentage (27%) of current couples, those where the higher-wage earners earnings were far greater than that of the lower-wage earner. The cost of this strategy to the Social Security Administration would have been greater for an earlier generation of Americans when many women did not work or had very low lifetime earnings.

The research found that the claim now, claim more later strategy could benefit many more couples, with a higher cost to the Social Security Administration of approximately $23.3 billion per year if all couples fully optimize their file strategies. Fortunately for the Social Security system, but not the average couples, most couples do not optimize their strategies and leave significant money on the table. Based on real-life reported behavior, its estimated that the real cost to the Social Security Administration would be closer to only $9.7 billion per year. I would expect that with greater public awareness of these strategies and more educated financial planners this number should increase in the coming years but only time will tell.

With total income for Social Security Retirement and Survivors programs of $731 billion in 2012, the cost of these claiming strategies seems modest yet Congress will eventually be forced to look for ways to balance future balance sheets as the Trust Fund gets spent down. These juicy strategies could be on the chopping block but, for now, they may provide some real benefits to your clients.

I hear that House Republicans have a shiny new health care plan they plan to introduce sometime soon. Before I read past the headlines, let me take a guess at what’s in it:

Tort reform

Health savings accounts

Interstate purchase of health plans

High-risk pools

OK, now let’s take a look. Here is Robert Costa in the Washington Post:

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.

Hmmm. It looks like I missed a couple of things: “inducements” for small businesses and “guaranteed renewability” of policies. Still, I nailed the main points. That’s a pretty amazing feat of crystal ball gazing, isn’t it?

No, of course not. It’s like predicting that a Republican tax plan will include lower rates on the rich. They might package it in different wrapping paper, but it’s always the same old stuff. And it’s worth keeping in mind that guaranteed renewability of policies has been the law for a long time, so it’s unlikely the GOP plan actually offers anything substantive on that point. Ditto for the small business “inducements,” which will probably just turn out to be tax cuts of some kind.

Basically, Republican health care proposals are always, always, always a repackaging of the four tired old points above. Nobody seriously thinks that any of them will expand access to health care in any serious way, but that doesn’t matter. These are the only things Republicans can all agree on, so that’s what they always propose. Whether it works or not isn’t really the point.

It was taken by Libyan rebels, demanding more oil wealth and autonomy

They had loaded 37-ton ship with crude oil stolen from port of Es Sider



U.S. Navy SEALs stormed a North Korean oil tanker off the coast of Cyprus last night after it was stolen and held for ransom by a mob of armed Libyan rebels.

Under cover of darkness, the elite team of commandos swooped onto the The Morning Glory from a helicopter after tracking it down to a bolt hole some 18 miles southwest of the island nation.



A Pentagon spokesman said they were met with next to no resistance as they swept silently through the vessel's corridors and cabins, arresting all inside. Nobody was injured in the operation.



The vessel was stolen from the port of Es Sider last month by Libyan anti-Government insurgents, who are demanding a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy from the country's fledgling administration.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany's constitutional court has upheld the country's participation in a fund that can bail out troubled governments in the eurozone.

The court in Karlsruhe ruled Tuesday that being part of the fund did not violate the German parliament's right to decide how taxpayer money is spent.

Germany is the largest backer of the fund because it is the biggest economy in the 18-country currency union.

The court had already indicated in a preliminary ruling in 2012 that the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, did not violate German law, enabling President Joachim Gauck to sign off on ratification of the treaty that set up the fund.

The court has referred another important question — whether the European Central Bank can make unlimited purchases of government bonds — to the European Court of Justice.###1788||Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Urban Outfitters (URBN) slid in the the stock market today after the retailers posted holiday period financial results and gave disappointing guidance for the first quarter. But shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) moved higher after it reported Q4 financial results Tuesday before the bell, despite the fact it gave a first-quarter outlook below Wall Street views.

Struggling teen-apparel retailer American Eagle saw its fourth straight quarter of sales and earnings declines when it posted Q4 earnings before the bell Tuesday. Earnings slid 51% to 27 cents a share, slightly above forecasts by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Sales slipped 7% to $1.04 billion, also ahead of views.

But the company gave a cautious Q1 outlook: "Business conditions remain challenging with severe winter weather contributing to weak demand," it said. Based on a high single-digit decline in same-store sales, the company expects earnings to be about break-even compared to adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share a year earlier. That would be below analysts' views for 13 cents a share.

Dick's saw an 8% rise in earnings to $1.11 a share, in line with forecasts. Revenue rose 8% to $1.947 billion, topping estimates.

But the sporting goods retailer gave Q1 earnings guidance of 51 cents to 53 cents a share, below analysts' forecasts for 54 cents a share.

Urban Outfitters, which reported Monday night, saw Q4 earnings rise 5% to 59 cents a share, ahead of forecasts. But it was the first single-digit decline the trendy apparel and accessories retail store operators has seen in six quarters. Revenue rose 6% to $905.9 million, well below consensus.

Urban Outfitters operates stores under its namesake, Anthropologie and Free People brands. CEO Richard Hayne warned about Q1 for its namesake brand: "Looking forward, customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at our Anthropologie and Free People brands have been strong, but given the continued challenges facing the Urban Outfitters brand, we remain very cautious about URBN's first quarter performance," he said in a statement.

Separately on Tuesday, Wall Street got some encouraging news on the retail front. The International Council of Shopping Centers-Goldman Sachs chain-store sales index rose by a solid 1.3% for the week ended March 8 from the prior week's seasonally adjusted level as consumers came out of hibernation and shopped more. The index rose 2.1% vs. a year earlier.

Sales, however, were uneven by segment. The ICSC-Goldman Sachs consumer tracking survey found improvement at drug, discounters, wholesale club, specialty and electronics stores. But grocery, department, apparel, dollar and furniture stores were weaker.###1789||Shanghai/Hong Kong: China`s yuan eased against the dollar on Monday after the central bank doubled the currency`s daily trading band as part of its commitment to let markets play a greater role in the economy.

This week, Janet Yellen leads her first Federal Reserve meeting and holds her first news conference since becoming the central bank's new chair.

Monetary policy under Yellen is expected to virtually mimic that of predecessor Ben Bernanke, at least in the near-term. It's a bit like the classic rock hit "Won't Get Fooled Again" by The Who, specifically the lyrics, "Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss." That continuity should be welcome by the financial markets, which don't tend to digest change well.

A busy week

Here's what we have on the economic calendar this week:

The Fed reports on February industrial production, Monday at 9:15 a.m. (all times Eastern).

The Commerce Department reports on February housing starts, Tuesday at 8:30 a.m.

The Labor Department reports on the February Consumer Price Index, Tuesday at 8:30 a.m.

The Fed releases a statement after its policy meeting and Yellen holds a news conference, Wednesday afternoon.

The National Association of Realtors releases February existing home sales, Thursday at 10 a.m.

The Conference Board releases the index of leading economic indicators, Friday at 10 a.m.

On the Fed's agenda

The Federal Reserve's meeting is expected to result in another decision to reduce monthly asset purchases -- a wind-down that's widely become known as "tapering."

Specifically, the pace of bond-buying is expected to be cut by another $10 billion to $55 billion. The asset purchases are on track to end this year.

Many experts believe the Fed's first boost in short-term interest rates will come next year.

"From their perspective, I think they're going to try to keep in that mid-2015 (range). Right now, they don’t want to rock the apple cart," says Diane Swonk, chief economist with Mesirow Financial. But she thinks there's a chance the Fed might not be able to raise rates quite so soon, particularly if the recovery stumbles and inflation remains remarkably low.

Economy's temperature?

With winter presumably on its last legs, the economy is expected to shake off its recent chill. There was a reassuring sign last week when the government reported a better-than-expected 0.3 percent increase in retail sales.

"The spring recovery is on the way," writes economist Scott Anderson with Bank of the West.

For many, the arrival of spring will be more welcome than usual. That's especially true for businesses that have been seeing diminished sales because of harsh winter weather.

Some economists think growth for the first quarter will come in below 2 percent. The prediction from Chris Christopher, director of consumer economics for IHS Global Insight, is for gross domestic product growth of just 1.4 percent in the first three months of the year.

"If we'd had regular winter weather, that would've been 1.6 percent," he says.

Housing complexities

Housing, too, has been affected by the bad weather, among other negative factors. They include "tight credit, eroding affordability conditions and limited inventory," says Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors.

As we move into the springtime, "we'll probably see a bounce-back," Molony says. For all of 2014, he looks for sales of previously owned homes to be flat to down 0.2 percent this year.

"Prices, on the other hand, are likely to grow 5 (percent) to 6 percent because of ongoing shortages," Molony notes.

Of course, local conditions vary, depending upon the market. There's that "location, location, location" thing.

This week in business history

On March 18, 1852, Wells Fargo was founded. It rapidly became synonymous with one of the leading forms of transportation: the stage coach. The name has become iconic from movies about the Old West.

Before the automobile, a stage coach could carry some combination of passengers and freight, including gold dust and business papers. In 1869, completion of the transcontinental railroad was the beginning of the end for the stage coach business. But Wells Fargo lives on as one of the nation's largest banks.

Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high on Thursday, while copper re-approached the lowest level since July 2010 as investors continued to monitor the standoff in Ukraine and amid ongoing fears over the health of China’s economy.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.40 a troy ounce, the most since September 9.

Gold last traded at $1,371.80 an ounce during U.S. morning hours, up 0.09%, or $1.30. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce, on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from September 9.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.3%, or $0.06 cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday’s session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.

Silver futures were likely to find support at $20.67 a troy ounce, the low from March 11 and resistance at $21.61, the high from March 7.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies “will be forced to apply a cost to Russia’s violations of international law and its encroachments on Ukraine.”

President Obama’s comments came after Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex Crimea.

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with further action "individually and collectively."

Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data later in the day for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped 0.55% to trade at $2.946 a pound following the release of lackluster data out of China.

Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest since March 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5% increase.

A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace for the first two months since 2004.

Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions as growing concerns over the health of China’s economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the weakest since July 2010.###1798||Empty###1799||Text size

Asian markets slumped today, after China reported over the weekend weaker-than-expected February exports data. February exports slumped 18% from a year ago, surprising the market which had expected a 5% increase.

In addition, Beijingweakened its daily reference rate against the dollar by the largest since 2012, in another attempt to break the one-way bet of yuan and halt the hot flow of offshore money into China. The offshore yuan dropped to 6.13 per dollar from 6.10 on Friday.

Asia equities slumped today on renewed concerns over a China slowdown. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index was down 1.7%, the Shanghai Composite Stock Market Index slumped 2.9%. Taiwan and South Korea followed China lower as well. The Taiwan TAIEX Index lost 0.6%. The KOSPI Composite Index retreated 1%.###1800||###1801||Empty###1802||* Revenue rises 0.9 pct to 1.31 bln eur in 2013

* Confirms three-year targets set at November IPO

* Drahi says won’t raise SFR offer (Adds detail, founder on SFR offer)

PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - French cable company Numericable reiterated its three-year targets on Wednesday to grow sales 2-5 percent annually and invest in upgrading its network, as it posted a small drop in full-year core profit.

Numericable, backed by entrepreneur Patrick Drahi, is in a bidding battle with Bouygues Telecom to take over France’s second-biggest telecom operator, Vivendi’s SFR.

Drahi told Les Echos newspaper that he would not raise its 10.9 billion euro ($15.1 billion) cash bid, which will leave Vivendi with a 32 percent stake in the new combined company. Bouygues is offering 10.5 billion and 46 percent.

Numericable is 40 percent owned by Altice, the holding company of founder Drahi.

Numericable said in a statement it confirmed the targets set at the time of its stock market listing in November, which include 220-230 million euros of additional spending to upgrade its network through 2016.

The company said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 0.5 percent to 616 million euros in 2013 as revenue edged 0.9 percent higher to 1.31 billion.

Average revenue per user rose 2.7 percent to 41.9 euros at the end of the fourth quarter, Numericable added.###1803||###1804||Empty###1805||Empty###1806||Comcast is fast becoming a powerful challenger to Apple and Amazon when it comes to selling downloaded movies and TV shows — the long-awaited replacement for DVDs and Blu-ray discs known in the industry as electronic sell through (or EST). And today’s deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment will help, bringing movies including American Hustle and Captain Phillips and TV series Breaking Bad and House Of Cards to the cable company’s offerings. Comcast already has carriage deals with Fox, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal (which the cable company owns), and Warner Bros — but not Disney, Paramount, DreamWorks Animation, or MGM. Comcast doesn’t yet support UltraViolet, so consumers who buy movies or shows from it can’t access them from the entertainment industry’s cloud-based storage lockers. Comcast has its own infrastructure that makes it possible for buyers to access the content they buy, even if they move or stop subscribing to the cable video service. Last month, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said that since Comcast began offering EST in November it “has captured 15% of the EST market and expanded the business.” He said that other cable operators likely will soon follow because “it’s been too successful for Comcast.” Consumers spent $424.8M on EST in Q4, up 44% from the period in 2012, according to Digital Entertainment Group data.###1807||Both Bill Ackman and Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) have spent a lot of money on lobbying efforts aimed to help them get their way. Ackman wants to discredit Herbalife as a pyramid scheme, while Herbalife is trying to convince regulators, lawmakers and consumer advocates that it isn’t a pyramid scheme. So far as Herbalife shares have risen, Ackman’s bet against the company got him into the red there. However, CNBC reports that he’s spent less on lobbying than Herbalife has. But then as they say, money talks, and of course there’s also the fact that Herbalife has—so far anyway—been winning the lobbying battle.

Ackman spends thousands, Herbalife spends millions

The network reports that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) spent almost $2 million in its lobbying efforts last year. Bill Ackman, on the other hand, spent $264,000 last year to lobby against the company. Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) is trying to convince policy makers that it isn’t a pyramid scheme, which is defined as a company in which distributors make more money for recruiting new distributors that they do for actually selling the company’s products.

Ackman reportedly hired three Washington lobbyists last year, making it the first time the fund has ever hired lobbyists, according to the U.S. Senate Disclosure Act Database. The filing indicates that Ibarra Strategy Group earned $30,000 from Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management fund during 2013. That firm specializes in outreach to the Latino community. The activist investor maintains that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) unfairly targets minorities and low income communities, although the company says it does not. The Moffett Group earned $84,000 from Pershing Square, while Wexler and Walker Public Policy Associates earned $150,000 from the firm.

Pershing may be stepping up its lobbying efforts this year, as the firm’s latest attempts have focused on discrediting Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s top distributors.

Will U.S. regulators investigate Herbalife?

Consumer advocates, including at least one Latina organization, have called for an investigation into Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s business practices. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey also called for a probe, sending letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both agencies refused to give a definitive answer on whether they were investigating, although the FTC said it was considering Sen. Markey’s request for an investigation.###1808||LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- China's January-February economic data released Thursday disappointed to the downside, sending stocks lower.

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) respects Alibaba's decision and wishes the company well, chief executive Charles Li said in a statement.

Alibaba's move to hold a U.S. initial public offering is a blow to the HKEx, which was initially the company's preferred listing venue for the deal.

"We have to consider possible changes where they might be necessary, with everything according to our due process," Li said in the statement. "The Listing Committee's work on shareholding structures didn't start because of Alibaba and will not end now because of Alibaba."

HILSENRATH’S TAKE

Take note of the fact that central bankers are talking a lot lately about the impact of “persistent headwinds” against the economy. They are making an argument that is central to view that they should keep interest rates unusually low even after they start rising from near zero.

New York Fed president William Dudley said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this month that “persistent headwinds” to growth explained why the economy would be unable to bear much higher interest rates in the years ahead. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said in a press conference last month that “persistent headwinds mean that, even in the medium term, the level of interest rates necessary to sustain low unemployment and price stability will be materially lower than before the crisis.” Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said in a press conference last September, “we expect that a number of factors—including the slow recovery of the housing sector, continued fiscal drag, perhaps continued effects from the financial crisis—may still prove to be headwinds to the recovery.”

Here’s why this matters so much.###1812||American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (NYSE: AEO) reported fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results before markets opened Tuesday. The specialty clothing retailer reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 and revenues of $1.04 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $0.55 on revenue of $1.12 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $0.26 and $1.03 billion in revenue.

For the full year, American Eagle reported EPS of $0.74 on revenues of $3.31 billion, compared with EPS of $1.39 on revenues of $3.48 billion in 2012. The 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year included an extra week, compared with 2013. The consensus estimates called for EPS of $0.73 on revenues of $3.3 billion.

The share price was sinking Tuesday morning because the company’s comments on its first-quarter outlook include a “high single-digit decline” in same-store sales. Earnings are expected to break even, compared with EPS of $0.18 a year ago and a consensus estimate of $0.13. That was all it took to send shares tumbling.

The company’s CEO said:

The Company’s results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations. We’re taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers. Our brands remain incredibly strong and I’m confident in our ability to execute the strategic plan and resume long-term profitable growth.

Shares traded down about 6.8% Tuesday morning, at $13.24 in a 52-week range of $12.59 to $21.07.

The once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday. This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.

On 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.

As Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.

The Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for Japanese bankruptcy protection (.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.

Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss -- taking place over several years -- was due to "weaknesses in the system" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.

Over the weekend , anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt. Gox systems and lifted apparent evidence that customer investments were not the target of theft, but instead are still being held at the exchange as part of a fraudulent plot by Mt. Gox management.###1816||Vodafone Group Monday jump-started its post-Verizon future, but AT&T remains in the wings.

But Vodafone itself is targeted.

Last week, AT&T warned the window for a wireless deal in Europe may be closing. The company has been open about its interest in Europe, and people familiar with the matter say it has explored a bid for Vodafone.###1817||Gold prices were little changed on Monday as disappointing Chinese export data helped underpin the market, with bullion investors closely monitoring the latest development in the standoff in Ukraine between Russia and the West.

Earlier in the session, the yellow metal was trading lower, extending Friday's weakness after a strong February US job report.

The market later recouped initial losses as investors turned their focus to a report from China which showed the world's second-largest economy posted an unexpected tumble in export in February.

With diplomacy at a standstill, gold did not respond from the worst standoff between Russia and the West since the Cold War. On Monday, Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks resolving the Ukraine crisis.

"Provided there is no escalation in the Ukraine crisis, there's no urgency for fresh buyers to enter at current price," said Edel Tully, precious metals strategist at UBS.

Tully said that, however, gold's ability to hold above key lows despite strong US job data on Friday suggests gold buyers should hold onto their bullish positions in the longer run.

US COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up USD 3.30 an ounce at USD 1,341.50, with trading volume in line with its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.

Also supporting gold prices were lower US stocks on the soft data out of China and lingering concerns over Russia's claim over part of Ukraine.

Commodities in general sold off after a surprise fall in China's exports, with copper sinking to 8-1/2-month lows, while oil prices also fell.

CHINESE GOLD AT DISCOUNT

Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of USD 5-USD 6 an ounce to spot prices, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than USD 20 at the beginning of the year.

Investing.com - The pound trimmed losses against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, but remained under pressure after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney indicated earlier in the trading session that there is leeway for the bank to leave rates on hold for longer.

GBP/USD pulled away from 1.6597, the pair's lowest since February 24, to hit 1.6639 during U.S. morning trade, still down 0.03%.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6555, the low of January 23 and resistance at 1.6742, Monday's high.

During testimony to parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, Carney said the amount of spare capacity in the economy was probably slightly higher than 1.5% of gross domestic product, indicating that the economic recovery can continue without pushing up inflation.

He added that there was a range of views among the bank's monetary policy committee members on the amount of spare capacity in the economy.

Carney also reiterated that when rate increases do come they will be gradual.

Earlier Tuesday, data showed that U.K. manufacturing output rose more than expected in January, but bad weather hampered the broader measure of industrial output.

Manufacturing production rose 0.4% in January, the Office for National Statistics reported, above expectations for a 0.3% gain, while December's figure was revised up to a 0.4% increase from a previously reported gain of 0.3%.

On a year-over-year basis, manufacturing production rose 3.3%, up from 1.4% in December.

Industrial output rose 0.1% in January, slowing sharply after a 0.5% increase in December and was up 2.9% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected industrial output to rise 0.2% in January.

Sterling was steady against the euro, with EUR/GBP inching up 0.01% to 0.8337.

Also Tuesday, European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said the bank made its forward guidance on the existence of slack in the euro zone economy more precise at last week's meeting, but this was not picked up by markets.

He also said the central bank still had policy options available, including lower interest rates or quantitative easing, if necessary.###1820||File photo: Stringer Germany

London - German shares edged higher on Tuesday, outperforming mostly flat European stocks, as strong trade data from the region's largest economy revived investor appetite for the Dax index. Broader market sentiment, however, was still undermined by a crisis in Ukraine, where confrontation between Kiev and Moscow showed no sign of easing.

Frankfurt's Dax blue-chip index, up 0.3 percent, bucked the trend after Germany reported seasonally adjusted exports and imports both rose more than forecast in January. The bounce was led by stocks exposed to the European economy, such as car maker VW and consumer-goods maker Henkel.

The Dax had fallen 2.9 percent in the previous two sessions, dragged down by worries about Ukraine and by disappointing Chinese trade data.

“The German trade figures were very solid and do point to a continuing recovery combined with an acceleration in growth in 2014,” said Markus Huber, a senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black. “Much will depend (on) how long the crisis in the Ukraine will drag on and if harmful sanctions and counter-sanctions will be put in place.”

Russia's moves to take over Crimea have led to plans for a referendum on March 16 on whether to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. Those plans have provoked condemnation from western countries and the threat of international sanctions against Russia.

The STOXX Europe 600 index of the region's top shares was flat at 331.30 points at 1157 GMT, keeping just above support at 330 points, corresponding to last week's low.

The STOXX was still facing resistance at 339 points, a six-year high set earlier this month, with buyers reluctant to push the index to fresh highs amid threats of a war in Europe.

“If I were talking to a trader, I'd say, 'Buy now and sell at (Monday's high of) 334 and a half, even though it's a really small gain'“, said Valerie Gastaldy, the head of Paris-based technical trading firm, Day-By-Day. “This is a sideways market and I'd do as little trading as possible, because both upside and downside are limited.”

Gastaldy said the STOXX may fall as low as 320 points in the next few weeks and was waiting for the S&P 500, which had hit an all-time high on Friday, to resume its uptrend before buying back into European shares.

The narrower FTSEurofirst 300 was also flat at 1,320.37 points.

PORTUGAL LEADS RISERS

Among smaller bourses, Portugal's PSI index was the best performer, up 0.7 percent, led by lender Banco Comercial Portugues, on optimism about the debt-laden country's growth prospects.

Portugal's gross domestic product grew a revised 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the previous quarter as consumer demand rebounded and exports rose, data showed on Tuesday.

The release strengthened investor optimism that economies in southern Europe were starting to recover, as strong Italian data on Monday suggested.

The PSI has surged around 16 percent this year, leading a rally in southern European indexes. Italy's FTSE MIB has risen nearly 10 percent and Spain's Ibex roughly 3 percent.

While euro zone shares are now up 10 percent from their levels of three years ago, just before the euro zone debt crisis reached its peak, Portuguese stocks are still down 20 percent.

The MSCI Portugal index trades at a small discount to its euro zone peers, compared with a premium of up to 60 percent in 2009, Datastream data showed.

“Portugal has been recovering, and to some extent it has regained the confidence of financial markets,” said Wouter Sturkenboom, strategist at Russell Investments, who has a positive stance on peripheral European indexes

“At the same time, the problems Portugal is facing are still very real: it has extremely high debt levels and it's going to be extremely hard to deal with that debt without external support, so that's holding us back a little.”

Analysis: Comcast wants to become "a new kind of monopolist."

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

Let’s connect the dots today. Here’s Story A….

”Comcast execs led by executive vice president David Cohen pitched the Time Warner Cable deal to FCC commissioners last week in meetings over a couple of days,” Multichannel News reports.

Cohen offered three reasons why regulators should allow the merger:

• The combined company still has less than 30 percent of all cable subscriptions in the United States, a now-unusued thresshold the FCC formerly used in such cases.

• Comcast has already been through a big merger recently and demonstrated it can abide by federal conditions on the process.

• No net neutrality or other broadband harms, because Comcast already agreed to abide by current rules until 2018.

…which leads us to Story B: Politico reports Comcast has spread cash “to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it.”

In fact, money from Comcast’s political action committee has flowed to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Checks have landed in the campaign coffers of Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), who oversee the chamber’s antitrust panel. Meanwhile, the cable giant has donated in some way to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is planning a hearing of its own. And Comcast has canvassed the two congressional panels that chiefly regulate cable, broadband and other telecom issues, donating to practically every lawmaker there — including Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.). Comcast stresses its donations are a function of its business. “Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,” said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice. “It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers.”

Story C: TheStreet.com speculates what that money is intended for:

Comcast is determined to become a new kind of monopolist, combining elements of the old AT&T, Fox, and Disney empires. By using its massive lobbying power in Washington — it has contributed to nearly every senator overseeing its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC_) — Comcast first intends to become the dominant Internet pipe in the country.”

And the final leg of that plan, according to The Street? Become more magical than the Magic Kingdom.The Philadelphia Inquirer examined that possibility on Sunday, Story D.

This summer, Comcast will open a new Harry Potter ride and Potter-themed area at its second theme park, Univeral Studios Florida, which will share space with the original on the same 750-acre Universal complex. To keep ticket-buying visitors for extra days, the cable-TV company is financing what it calls the largest hotel construction project in North America: the 1,800-room, 1960s-themed Cabana Bay Beach Resort – think of the biggest Wildwood hotel you know and imagine it stretching over multiple football fields. Cabana Bay guests now can sleep, eat, and swim on the same complex as the theme parks. Comcast’s 50-50 partner is Loews Corp.//

The smart money appears to be on some kind of gradual decompression – a fault causes an aeroplane to leak breathable air so slowly out of the cabin that the pilots don’t realise they have a problem until it’s too late, when oxygen starvation prevents them from taking any decisions.



This would account for the plane drifting off course: Malaysian air force radar apparently picked up the flight off the Thai resort island of Phuket, hundreds of miles from where it should have been. Rolls-Royce have in-flight data suggesting the planes engines were working for four hours after its last radio-check with Kuala Lumpur control.



The most famous and tragic example of this phenomenon occurred in 2005, when a Helios Airways flight from Larnaca in Cyprus to Athens crashed into a Greek hillside because the pilots had failed to flick the automatic cabin pressurisation switch. As the plane climbed, gradually all the passengers and crew would have slipped into unconsciousness.



Eerie and tragic though this was, at least it meant that few people on the plane would have been aware of their impending doom. Unlike a Lockerbie-style explosion in mid-air when a number of passengers may have been initially conscious of what was going on as they fell through the air: rows of first class passengers were found still strapped into their seats, some with their fingers crossed.



Terrorism is certainly a possibility. The FBI are said to be looking at some kind of hijacking. Both the bombing of the USS Cole and the 9/11 attacks owed their gestation to a meeting of top al-Qaeda planners held in January 2000 in Kuala Lumpur.



As for flight 370, security at Kuala Lumpur International Airport seems to have been sloppy. We know for sure that at least two male passengers on the plane were Iranians travelling on stolen passports. Apparently, they had no connection with terrorism and were merely seeking new lives in the West. They are victims too, of course.



Still, a security system that doesn’t flag up young Iranian men travelling on EU passports, known to have been stolen, is a waste of rations. The Malaysian authorities are certainly nervous of any terror connection, which may account for their often vague and rambling briefings over the past few days.



But just as the sea can be a strange place – think of the Marie Celeste, the Canadian-registered schooner found floating in the Bay of Gibraltar in 1872, abandoned by her crew – strange and inexplicable things can happen in the air.



The Bermuda Triangle, an area of the North Atlantic lying between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, is notorious for aircraft disappearing in mysterious circumstances. In one of the first of many incidents to be reported, 'Flight 19', a group of five US fighter bombers, disappeared in the area in December 1945 on a navigational training exercise in circumstances that have never been fully explained.



South East Asia may have its own Bermuda Triangle, according to one Malaysian opposition politician. One of the strangest incidents in the region took place in the region in 1946, involving Air Marshal Sir Victor Goddard, a pilot in both the First and Second World Wars.



At an RAF cocktail party in Shanghai, Goddard overheard another officer talking of a recent dream in which a Dakota transport aeroplane iced up and crashed on a rocky beach beneath mountains, killing the air marshal and the other passengers – a man and two women.



Goddard thought nothing of it at the time – he was due to be flown to Tokyo that night but in a different type of aircraft, and as the only passenger.



Others at the party, hearing that the air marshal’s plane was empty, persuaded him to take some additional passengers – a man and two women. After arriving at the airfield they discovered that the aircraft originally prepared for the flight had developed mechanical problems. The replacement, fuelled and ready for take-off, was a Dakota.



Some hours into the flight, and in bad weather, the plane’s flaps iced over, forcing it to make a crash landing on a rocky beach on the mountainous Japanese island of Sado. Luckily, everyone survived.



The incident was used as the basis of a marvellous 1955 Ealing Studios film, The Night My Number Came Up, with Michael Redgrave playing the air marshal and various Ealing stalwarts the other characters. The tension and suspense in the film are extraordinarily well done, but at least in the background there was no prospect of a military conflagration breaking out.



Imagine what might happen if a Chinese Air Force transport plane or a formation of fighters on a navigational exercise went missing in mysterious circumstances. South East Asia has some of the busiest air routes in the world, very often flying over the South China Sea, an area bedevilled with high-octane territorial disputes. There are no margins for error.



We need to know what happened to Flight 370 quickly. But we won’t understand the full picture until its black box flight recorder is recovered.



That’s right, someone has to physically discover and retrieve the item from the jungle or the seabed before we can piece together the plane’s last moments.



This is crazy - the aeronautical equivalent of someone who refuses to use e-mail or buy a mobile phone. Live streaming of flight data should be introduced asap.###1823||Pakistan strongly reacts to Indian purchase of S-400 missiles: Pakistan said Friday the Indian purchase of S-400 missile system is a part of their efforts to acquire a Ballistic Missile Defence ...###1824||Tia Giftos hold an iPad that can be used to purchase using “Bitcoins” at the Coffeetime@Hellasbakery in Albany.###1825||###1826||The pair spiked up to a fresh daily high at 1.3103 before retreating slightly, as UK PM Theresa May is said to drop a key demand with an aim to resolve the Irish border issue that has been one of the main roadblocks in Brexit negotiations.###1827||King Digital Entertainment, the company behind Candy Crush, detailed IPO plans and its price sets a valuation that's a lot higher than that of social gamer Zynga, whose stock has gotten crushed.

DENVER - Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 per cent sales taxes and 15 per cent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.

Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about how to spend the windfall.

Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.

Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

"The whole world wants to belly up to this trough," said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado's budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.

Colorado's pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state's unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year's pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it's not clear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado's JBC plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

"There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don't think it's going to be that simple," said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another JBC member.

Colorado's 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Candy Crush Saga involves swapping candies to make rows of three



Study wanted to test whether this game was what’s called NP-hard

NP is a problem that is difficult to check, or can only be solved with a PC

To test this theory, a researcher constructed a theoretical board of candies



They then tried to establish a generic formula for solving each puzzle

This involved trying to prove whether a certain score could be achieved with a set number of swaps

It wasn’t easy to solve, meaning the game was classified as NP-complete

Next time someone criticises you for playing too much Candy Crush, you can tell them you’re actually solving a complex mathematical problem.

Australian researcher Toby Walsh wanted to test whether the game was what’s called NP-hard - or difficult to solve without a computer.

To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and was able to turn it into a logical math puzzle - meaning the strategy could be classified alongside other complex problems, confirming it is NP.

Australian Toby Walsh wanted to test whether Candy Crush was NP-complete, or difficult to solve without a computer. To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and turned it into a logic puzzle. The high number of possible outcomes he uncovered proves the games complexity

WHY IS THE GAME SO DIFFICULT?

Put simply, if a starting board of candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player has to decide which row to complete first. Once they have selected this row, it sets off a chain reaction and directly influences which candies fall where as the game continues. Once the game is solved, the player would need to start again, but this time choose the other row option, to determine which route scored the highest points. To make an informed, mathematical decision about which row to choose, however, requires knowing what candies will appear once the row has been completed. Each time candies fall, they create a number of new row options, increasing the number of possible outcomes. To check the best score, the player would have to go back over each possible outcome, and the rows that follow - producing a puzzle that can’t be solved manually.



Candy Crush Saga is a hugely popular game in which players move different coloured candies around a board to create lines of three in a row.

Once a line of three matching candies is completed, they disappear and candies drop from the top of the screen to fill the gaps.

Early rounds involve making a number of swaps in a set timeframe, or to achieve a minimum score.

Due to the large number of variables, Toby Walsh from NICTA and University of New South Wales, wanted to see whether the game was a P math problem, or an NP problem.

P problems are puzzles that are easy to solve, while NP problems are much more difficult and can only be solved by a computer because of the large amount of data produced.

To test this theory, Walsh constructed a theoretical board of candies, in which the size of the board was unrestricted.

He then tested whether it was possible to create a sequence of swaps (k) that obtained a specific score (s).

If a board of candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player has to decide which row to complete first. This sets off a chain reaction and directly influences future moves. Once the game is solved, the player must start again numerous times to try all the possible swap options

This turned the game into a mathematical problem. In the process of trying to solve this formula, Walsh concluded the variables and possible outcomes for each level were so high only a computer would be able to process the information – making the puzzle not only NP, but NP-complete.

NP-complete puzzles have solutions that can be applied to all other NP problems, but finding that one solution is difficult.

For example, if Walsh found the solution to the Candy Crush problem, in theory, this same solution could be applied to other puzzles with large number of variables and outcomes.

The same strategy was also used to prove games including Super Mario Brothers and Zelda are also NP-hard.###1832||(Corrects paragraph 2 to say the offer is at a premium of 5.1 percent, not 1.3 percent)

Health insurance reform through the Affordable Care Act is working. Not a week goes by that I don’t see a Facebook posting, or talk to an acquaintance who’s self-employed, who tells me their happy status of now being insured because of Obamacare. These are folks who were previously shut out of health insurance because they worked part-time, were self-employed, had pre-existing conditions, or simply could not afford it. Now, with the Marketplace, the new rules about guaranteed issue and no pre-existing conditions, and the subsidies available for moderate income earners, people are signing up and getting coverage.



In New Hampshire enrollment numbers have been great and are consistently performing well against the national benchmarks. “We are greatly outperforming expectations and are set to break our goal of over 19,000 enrollment by March 31,” a spokesman from CoveringNewHampshire.org told me on March 11.



In fact reports later that day put New Hampshire at over 21,000! Nationally, while the ACA certainly had a lousy launch, the website Healthcare.gov is now functioning effectively, and national estimates put the number of enrollees between 4 and 5 million people. States that embraced the ACA early, and built strong websites, such as California, New York, and Kentucky, are having the most success. The percentage of uninsured in the U.S. has been reported by Gallup to have dropped from 17.1 percent to 15.9 percent in just a three-month period, bucking a decades-long trend of increasing numbers. The strong numbers of New Hampshire enrollees shows how great the need has been, in spite of legislative road blocks put in place a couple of years ago. Prohibition against a state-based exchange, and delayed acceptance of grants to cover marketing efforts of our state’s insurance department, left us with an uncertain insurance environment. This is probably a major factor as to why there is only one carrier, Anthem, in our Marketplace. New Hampshire’s very informative marketing website, CoveringNewHampshire.org, wasn’t able to launch until December 24, 2013.



Although the narrow network of the Anthem plan may be annoying or inconvenient to some, it has meant that Anthem was able to keep its premiums about 25 percent lower that they might have been. This will also be a temporary problem. More insurance companies are expected to enter the Marketplace by 2015.



About Medicaid Expansion: A bill has passed in the N.H. Senate, and last week was heard in the House, that will allow the expansion of coverage to another 50,000 residents at or below poverty level, by using federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance. By not passing legislation last fall, New Hampshire has lost $40 million into our economy, half a million a day, since Jan. 1. That could have been covering those eligible, many of whom work minimum wage jobs — and pay payroll taxes!







The end of job-lock



The ACA has meant the end of job-lock. What’s that? For a long time, I’d encountered families in New Hampshire where one spouse was self-employed, and the other had the health-care job, because the cost of buying insurance as a small business was too expensive. Often that spouse felt locked into that full-time job because her family would not have health coverage otherwise. These families often put infants and small children in costly daycare, rather than work part-time and/or stay home.



The ACA now means that these families can be certain of coverage tailored to their income level, and they can make clear decisions about how much time to dedicate to work and to family.







The cancellation myth



First, every insurance contract is for one year. Insurance products change every year. In the past, if you wanted to keep the same insurance coverage as last year, it often meant a double-digit percentage premium increase. If you wanted to keep roughly the same premium, you often had to double your out-of-pocket costs. Due to the ACA, the coverage required under new insurance policies meets a new standard, including more primary care at no cost, and limiting out-of-pocket expenses.



News reports doing follow-ups on individuals claiming their policies got cancelled and their premiums skyrocketed regularly find that those people did find much better coverage at lower costs due to subsidies, once they shopped the Marketplace.







Enrollment deadline March 31



Two weeks left to enroll. How? CoveringNewHampshire.org is our state’s website for all kinds of information about enrolling in the ACA. Here you can find out about the plans available, financial assistance, and start enrollment. There are links to finding help, to contacting In-Person Assisters (The River Center in Peterborough is one location), and almost daily events state-wide for application assistance. There’s no reason to be uninsured anymore. You can’t be denied. It will be affordable. Do it for your own peace of mind.

###1835||The US Department of Defense confirmed on Monday that Navy SEALs had regained control of an oil tanker which had been seized illegally by armed men earlier in March.

"US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory [late Sunday night]," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

US President Obama had approved the military operation, which took place in international waters southeast of Cyprus. There were no reports of injuries.

The tanker will be "underway soon to a port in Libya," Kirby added.

Earlier this month, three armed Libyans took control of the North Korean tanker, which had been operated by an Egypt-based company at the time. The rebels then loaded at least 200,000 barrels of crude oil onto the vessel at the Libyan port of Al-Sidra, according to Libya's National Oil Corporation.

The company had been allowed to use the North Korean flag temporarily under an agreement with Pyongyang, North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported last week.North Korea later distanced itself from responbility for the tanker, as it had violated laws about carrying contraband.

The incident led to an escalation with the Libyan government, which threatened to bomb the vessel. The failure to stop the tanker escaping from Libyan authorities prompted the Libyan government to oust its prime minister, Ali Zeidan, who subsequently fled the country.

The bull run is not the longest or strongest in history, but it has survived the US government’s near default, Europe’s debt crisis, and Syria’s war.

A bull market is a rise of 20 percent or more over at least six months, following a decline of 20 percent or more. The runup over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the US economic recovery, and companies repurchasing their stock.

The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to secede and join Russia. President Obama and other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.

Yet stocks recovered and the S&P 500 closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.

There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest stretched for almost a decade, October 1990 to March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4½ years, making the current one longer than average.

The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was beginning. The S&P 500 fell 57 percent — from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009 — before bottoming at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.

Typically, bull markets end when investors are spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving, and consumer confidence is rising.

Inflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it raises interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.

But with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero.

Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next 12 months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, is 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.

The stock market is ‘‘not cheap, but it’s not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice,’’ Manley says.

Since starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent. If you played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays US aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market.

If you played it even safer and invested in short-term government debt, certificates of deposit, and other short-term debt securities, your return would be even smaller. Fidelity’s money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent.###1838||Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.###1839||



SINGAPORE: Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 4½ months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal.

China's inflation slowed more than estimated to a 13-month low last month while factory-gate deflation deepened as prices cooled following a week-long holiday. The consumer price index rose 2 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, compared with the 2.1 percent median estimate in a survey of analysts.

Hong Kong and Beijing - China’s exports fell last month by the most since the global financial crisis, dealing another blow to confidence as Communist Party leaders meeting in Beijing assess the risk from the nation’s first onshore bond default. Shipments abroad dropped 18.1 percent from a year earlier in February, the customs administration said at the weekend, trailing the median estimate for a 7.5 percent rise in a survey of 45 economists.

Distortions in the data from the Lunar New Year holiday and fake invoicing that inflated data last year make it harder to assess the true picture. As China chases a 7.5 percent annual growth target, set at last week’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, officials need to contain stresses in the financial system from the credit boom that began with stimulus measures in 2008.

“People see a lot of negative news coming out of China: growth momentum is slowing and when there is a default of one company they tend to think it’s going to be a systemic problem and spill over into the rest of the economy,” said Ding Shuang, a senior China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong. “These numbers may support their negative views, that even external demand may not be that strong.”

Even so, the drop in exports was not as bad as it appeared when taking into account the holiday, the inflated base of last year’s numbers, as well as a weather-related “soft patch” in the US economy, said Ding, whose forecast of an 8.5 percent decline in sales was closest to the customs figure.

Imports rose 10.1 percent, more than projected.

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology, a maker of solar cells, on Friday became the first company to default in China’s onshore bond market after failing to pay full interest due.

The number of publicly traded non-financial Chinese firms whose debt-to-equity ratios exceed 200 percent has jumped 57 percent since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index had its first gain in three weeks last week, rising 0.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop the previous week. The yuan posted its biggest weekly increase since October last year, following a record decline of 1.4 percent last month, on speculation the central bank ceased engineering a decline in the currency to discourage appreciation bets.

Trade would be a “clear drag” on growth in the first quarter and the yuan should weaken this week, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist and strategist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.

“The trade data explain some of the downward pressure on the yuan in February – it can be justified not only by central bank guidance but by actual deterioration of demand and supply in the forex market,” he said.

Analysts’ estimates for last month’s exports ranged from a drop of 8.5 percent to a 14.4 percent increase. The decline, after a 10.6 percent gain in January, was the biggest since August 2009.

Key commodities markets like New York, London and Hong Kong are just a few locations where silver changes hands. London is the center of physical silver trade, while the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange is where most paper silver trading is done.

Physical silver is sold on the spot market, meaning that buyers pay a specific price for the metal and then have it delivered immediately. Paper trading is done via the futures market, with participants agreeing for the delivery of silver in the future at an agreed-upon price. In such contracts, two positions can be taken for investing in silver: a long position to accept delivery of the metal, or a short position to provide delivery of the metal.

Paper trading might sound like a strange route to take, but it can provide those investing in silver with flexibility that they wouldn’t get from buying and selling physical silver. The most obvious advantage is perhaps the fact that trading in the paper markets means market participants can benefit from holding silver without needing to store it. Furthermore, futures trading can offer more financial leverage in that it requires less capital than trading in the physical market.

Silver Price History

In terms of historical price action, silver’s highest average annual price was $35.12 per ounce in 2011. The rise came on the back of very strong silver investment demand, and was more than double the 2009 average silver price of $14.67.

Like other commodities, silver’s price is most heavily influenced by supply and demand dynamics. The silver price is a little unique, however, in that it’s known for its volatility. That characteristic is partially due to the fact that the metal is subject to both investment and industrial demand. In other words, it’s bought both by investors interested in using it as a store of wealth and by manufacturers looking to use it for different applications. Those applications are incredibly varied – silver has diverse technological applications and is used in devices like batteries and catalysts, but it’s also used in medicine and in the automotive industry.

Looking at supply, in 2014, the world’s top three producers of the metal were Mexico, China and Peru. Interestingly, even in those countries the white metal is usually produced as a by-product – for instance, a mine producing primarily gold might also have silver output.

Silver Price Forecast

Silver prices have been on the downtrend lately. While analysts predicted the metal would average around $18 per ounce in 2015, that number has been closer to $15.91. As of the end of 2015, these were the silver price forecasts from a number of major firms and banks:

Capital Economics — $20 per ounce (by end of year)

CIBC — $15 per ounce

Citi Research — $15.70 per ounce

Commerzbank (OTCMKTS:CRZBY) — $16.50 per ounce (Q1 and Q2 2016)

HSBC — $18.25 per ounce

Natixis (EPA:KN) — $12.80 per ounce

Silver Price Manipulation

As a final note, it’s important for investors to be aware that price manipulation is a major issue in the silver space. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was long at the center of such claims, though the case against it was dismissed last year. Most recently, 10 banks were hit in a US probe on precious metals manipulation.

While that might sound disheartening, key industry figures like silver guru David Morgan have emphasizedthat in reality the silver market is no more manipulated than any other market. Furthermore, in 2014 the London Silver Market Fixing stopped administering the London silver fix, which had been used for over a century to fix the price of silver. It was replaced by the LBMA Silver Price, which is run by the LBMA, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and Thomson Reuters (TSX:TRI,NYSE:TRI), in a bid to increase market transparency.

When Will Silver Go Up?###1844||The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.

Subprime financial crisis-related events would ultimately become responsible for five out of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes, including the top two spots.

After the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 – a little under 18 months later.

U.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.

Since that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The S&P 500 Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the Nasdaq is up 235% (3,040.5).

Note: Turn market volatility into profits by learning to trade the market's most powerful index. Here's how…

In fact, as of this week, the bull market – defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more – ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group research.

However, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction – defined as a decline of 10% or more.

"I am very concerned about a correction right now," Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. "The past few weeks have seen higher prices and lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air – every step higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather and turn around."

Toyota Kirloskar Motor today declared lockout at its two manufacturing plants at Bidadi near Bangalore, following the failure of talks between the management and the union over wage negotiations.

The production at the two plants having an installed capacity of 3,10,000 units, has been disrupted since the past 25 days.

"The management and the union have been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY14 for the past 10 months.

As a bipartite agreement was not reached, the Karnataka Labour Department has conducted seven tripartite meetings to reach a settlement. But the conciliation efforts have not yet resulted in an agreement, leading to the lockout," the Japanese auto major said in a statement.

The statement also said even as the talks were on, a section of the workers, instigated by the union, has resorted to deliberate stoppage of the production line, and threatened supervisors and continuously disrupted business for the past 25 days.

"In this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," the statement concluded.

The workers' union, however, could not be contacted.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor is a 89:11 joint venture between the world's largest auto company Toyota and the Pune-based Kirloskar Group, respectively.

Set up in October 1997, the two plants at Bidadi employs over 6,400 people and has an installed capacity of 3,10,000 units per annum. The plant rolled out the first car in December 1999.

While the first facility has an installed capacity of 1,00,000 units, the second plant has an installed capacity of 2,10,000 units.

The two plants are set up on a sprawling 432 acre land parcel in the Bangalore suburb.

The company manufactures the MPV segment leader Innova, the SUV Fortuner, from the first plant since October 1999, while it has also been rolling out the sedans Corolla Altis, the Etios, the hatchback Etios Liva and the luxe sedans Camry, and the Camry Hybrid from the second plant since December 2010.

The company also sells the premium SUV brands Prado, the Land Cruiser and the hybrid sedan Prius as completely built units.###1849||Empty###1850||A recent story in The News reported on two new classes at Alpena High School: The Mechatronics and Amp Up courses blend traditional classroom lessons such as math ...

* Yellen could face questions after policy meeting next week

By Ann Saphir and Jonathan Spicer

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Janet Yellen has a message to markets: the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for a while yet and, when it does begin to tighten monetary policy, it will do so only slowly.

For now, the public has zeroed in on when the U.S. central bank might finally raise rates after more than five years near zero. But that tells only half the story: just as important for American families and businesses is how quickly the Fed will hike borrowing costs, and how high.

The Fed has telegraphed that the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year, as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, and policymakers are increasingly describing how the first tightening cycle in more than a decade will play out. It is an issue that Yellen, who took over as chair of the central bank last month, will almost certainly have to address after a policy meeting next week.

The plan for now is for a series of modest rate increases that do not risk sending the economy into relapse, according to Fed policymakers who have discussed it in recent weeks.

While an unexpected jump in inflation or a dangerous asset bubble could force its hand, the central bank is likely to deliver a dovish message of patience when it comes to removing its extraordinary monetary stimulus.

“What I’m anticipating is that the gradual rise in rates would acknowledge that there are still conditions out there that are sub-optimal,” Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, said in an interview last week.

“I can in no way predict exactly the conditions at that time,” he added. But “I don’t expect when we get to that point that we’re likely to have to move the policy rate up in large chunks to get it high fast.”

As with its easing cycle, the Fed will be in uncharted territory when the time comes to tighten. No major central bank has had to raise rates after keeping them at effectively zero for as long as the Fed has in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

By stressing a go-slow approach to tightening, the Fed can squeeze a little more stimulus out of its low-rate policy. If financial markets moved to price in a more abrupt tightening cycle, yields on long-term debt would rise, lifting borrowing costs.

“To me you really want to stretch out your expectations about the whole forward path of short rates,” New York Fed President William Dudley said last week.

“The more information that the Fed can give about what we are thinking about things going forward, I think the better market participants can assess us and, therefore, financial conditions can be set at an appropriate level.”

HOW FAST, HOW HIGH

The Fed could use its March 18-19 policy-setting meeting to map out its plan for rate rises, whether in the formal statement it issues afterward or in Yellen’s news conference.

It would not be the first time that a Fed chair will have suggested that rate increases will be far from sharp once they start. Yellen’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who stepped down at the end of January, said as much last June.

For Yellen, however, the gradualist approach would mark a departure of sorts.

As Fed vice chair she embraced a strategy known as “optimal control” in which rates are kept low for longer than might otherwise be expected in order to boost hiring. This approach would allow inflation to rise above the Fed’s 2 percent target for a short time, a problem that would then be addressed by sharper rate rises.

But most of Yellen’s colleagues don’t sanction such an approach.

Fed policymakers see the key federal funds rate at just 0.75 percent at the end of 2015, and at 1.75 percent by the end of 2016, according to the median of their forecasts published in December. That’s even slower than the two-percentage-points-per-year pace at which Alan Greenspan conducted the Fed’s last tightening cycle, which has been seen as the model of patience.

Still, what policymakers say today might not be what they do tomorrow.

“They will say ‘gradual and measured pace,’ but if the data gets a lot better then they will not hesitate to raise rates much faster,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.

Part of the calculus is deciding how high rates should be once the economy returns to normal. And because economic growth is still hobbled in the wake of the recession, the Fed believes rates may not need to be as high as in the past.

“The issue of how steep the increases are and then also where do we think the new normal interest rates are; I think those are really important questions,” John Williams, the head of the San Francisco Fed, said last week.###1856||Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signalled on Thursday that Beijing was willing to accept some debt defaults in the world's second-largest economy as it struggles to clean up its multi-trillion-dollar "shadow banking" sector.

His comments come after the country's first-ever default on a domestic corporate bond last week and as investors grow worried that other firms could follow suit.

Li said authorities "pay very high attention" to financial and debt risks, as he held his once-a-year news conference after the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the Communist Party-controlled legislature.

He could not possibly "want to see" defaults on financial products, he said at the Great Hall of the People.

"But I'm afraid sometimes certain individual cases of such defaults are hardly avoidable," he added.

Shanghai-based Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. said Friday it was unable to make bond interest payments of 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million), sending it into a landmark default.

And on Tuesday power equipment maker Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co. said its bonds would be suspended from trading after it posted two consecutive years of losses.

However, analysts said the Chaori default could benefit the market in the long term by raising awareness of risk and making investors more selective.

"Allowing Chaori to default on its bond was in fact an obvious sign that the government has started to make some adjustments (in policy)," said Zhou Hao, Shanghai-based economist for ANZ Bank.

"Previously, it wanted to avoid defaults, but now it hopes to rely more on market-oriented measures to ease some risk," he told AFP.

Ratings agency Moody's said: "We believe the default will spur needed development in the onshore bond market."

"The lack of intervention is consistent with the central Chinese government's adoption of more market-oriented policies, which include increased tolerance for corporate bond defaults, as it reforms the country's financial markets," it said.

Early this year, worries surfaced in China over other financial products issued by trust companies, which have drawn comparisons to American "junk bonds" of the 1980s.

In one case, a $160 million investment product structured by Jilin Province Trust and backed by a coal firm failed to make capital and interest payments.

Separately, a $500 million investment product structured by China Credit Trust avoided default in January after an unknown party made good on principal payments to hundreds of investors, though they did not received pledged interest.

Such products are part of a murky "shadow banking" system -- a vast network of lending outside formal channels and beyond the reach of regulators. They include activities by online finance platforms, credit guarantee companies and microcredit firms.

The "shadow banking" sector was as large as $4.8 trillion in 2012, more than half the country's gross domestic product, according to a previous estimate by Moody's.

Li said authorities have a grip on financial risks to the economy and played down worries over huge debts run up by local governments which have splurged on infrastructure and other investments.

Some local authorities, which have long used debt to fuel economic growth in their regions, have pursued projects that are economically unviable or unsustainable.

"What we should do is to step up monitoring, properly handle relevant measures and be sure that there will be no regional and systemic financial risks," Li said.

In late December, China revealed in a long-awaited debt audit that liabilities carried by local governments had ballooned to 17.9 trillion yuan as of the end of June 2013.

The figure, released by the National Audit Office, compared with 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010 -- an increase of 67 percent.

"We have released to the public the results of this comprehensive audit as it is, and the result shows that the risks are on the whole under control," Li said.###1857||The biggest story in the financial markets this morning is the weakness in Chinese assets. The Chinese Yuan sold off aggressively, experiencing one of the largest one-day declines since December. Chinese stocks were hit hard with the Shanghai Composite dropping more than 2.8%. Although a significantly weaker trade balance triggered the selling, China's central bank has been actively allowing the Chinese Yuan to weaken. After selling off throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013, CNY is down over 10% from its 2014 high as shown in the chart below. With no U.S. data scheduled for release at the front of this week, Chinese data and FX policy is driving currencies and equities around the world. Over the past two months, the market has been focused on the unexpected weather induced weakness in the U.S. data but slowing Chinese growth is one of main themes of 2014 and one with global ramifications.



The Yuan

Countries heavily reliant on Chinese growth such as Australia and Japan will be hit the hardest but the U.S. is also not immune to problems in Asia. A large part of the reason why U.S. stocks opened lower for trading this morning is because of the weakness in Asian equities. Many U.S. companies are also reliant on demand from China and their earnings could be negatively affected by slowing Chinese growth. The decline in the value of the Yuan also reduces the purchasing power of the Chinese. Both and have been affected by the weakness in Chinese assets. The following chart of the Shanghai Composite Index (white line) and the Nikkei (green line) shows that oftentimes, the movements in Chinese equities lead the movements in Japanese stocks. Since has a strong correlation with the Nikkei, this suggests that Japanese assets are also poised for further losses if Chinese equities continue to move lower.



Shanghai Composite vs. The Nikkei





The Yuan could not be moving this aggressively without the ok from the central bank. The rapid turnaround in the currency pair suggests that the People's Bank of China is shifting away from a policy of Yuan appreciation. Their motivation is simple - to use the exchange rate as a means to provide support for the export sector and in turn the overall economy. This morning's Chinese trade numbers show the severity of the problems in exports. The Chinese trade balance plunged into a deficit in the month of February due to a surprise 18% yoy decline in exports (economists had been looking for a 7.5% rise). China has accepted that growth will slow this year but they want it to happen gradually. Since it is a busy week for Chinese data and a quiet week for U.S. data, we expect G10 currencies along with global equities to take their cue from the East.

Gox to rebuild and pay back some of its creditors - as well as a warning that some spam or phishing emails purporting to be from the exchange were in circulation.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28, saying it may have lost 850,000 bitcoins - worth around $520 million at current prices - to hackers. It has since gone through a similar process in the United States.

The officials acknowledged the search for the jetliner, which disappeared early Saturday, is becoming harder and harder.

The report from The Wall Street Journal said U.S. aviation investigators and national security officials were basing their belief that the missing plane kept flying on data automatically transmitted to the ground from the passenger jet’s engines.

But Malaysia’s acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the report, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, was “inaccurate.”

Malaysian officials said they had consulted with the makers of the plane and its engines, who told them that no transmissions of any kind were received from the plane after air traffic controllers lost contact with it.

The report threatened to open the door to a fresh round of theories about what has become of the plane, which vanished while flying over Southeast Asia on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Four more hours in the air could have put the plane many hundreds of miles beyond the area currently being searched.

But one aviation industry observer expressed skepticism about the report even before the denials by officials.

“I find this very, very difficult to believe,” said Tom Ballantyne, chief correspondent for the magazine Orient Aviation. “That this aircraft could have flown on for four hours after it disappeared and not have been picked up by someone’s radar and not have been seen by anyone, it’s almost unbelievable.”

Search getting harder

The mystery over the fate of the passenger jet, a Boeing 777-200, and the 239 people it was carrying has so far left government officials and aviation experts flummoxed.

“With every passing day the task becomes more difficult,” Hishammuddin said Thursday.

Searchers have already been combing a vast area of sea and land for traces of the plane. But so far, with the search well into its sixth day, their efforts have been fruitless.

The Wall Street Journal report said the plane’s engines have an onboard monitoring system supplied by their manufacturer, Rolls-Royce PLC. The system “periodically sends bursts of data about engine health, operations and aircraft movements to facilities on the ground,” the newspaper said.

Malaysia Airlines sends its engine data live to Rolls-Royce for analysis, the report said, and that data is now being analyzed to figure out the flight path of the missing plane after contact was lost with its transponder, a radio transmitter in the cockpit that communicates with ground radar.

But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Thursday that Rolls-Royce and Boeing have reported that they didn’t receive transmissions of any kind after 1:07 a.m. Saturday. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane shortly afterward, around 1:30 a.m.

Erin Atan, a spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce in Asia, declined to comment on the matter, saying it was “an official air accident investigation.”

Still no trace

As word of the report spread, searchers appeared to draw another blank in the so-far frustrating endeavors to find traces of the plane.

Vietnamese and Malaysian planes spotted no sign of debris when they flew over an area of sea that Chinese authorities had flagged as the location of possible remnants of the missing plane, officials said.

China’s State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense had said satellite images showed “three suspected floating objects” that it described as “a suspected crash site.”

But Chinese authorities later said that the release of the satellite images was a mistake and that they didn’t show any debris relating to the plane, Hishammuddin said.

Malaysian officials say they are still trying to determine if a radar blip detected heading west soon after the plane lost contact was in fact the missing jet.

If it was, the plane would have been hundreds of miles off its original flight path and headed in the wrong direction. Malaysian officials say they have asked U.S. experts to help them analyze the radar data.

Meanwhile, India is joining the multinational search, dispatching two of its naval ships off the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands, a military spokesman said Thursday.

Navy and coast guard aircraft are also expected to be sent toward the Strait of Malacca once “exact coordinates” are received for the search area, Andaman and Nicobar’s joint naval command spokesman Harmeet Singh said.

Last known words

Also on Thursday, a Malaysian aviation official said that the last known words from the flight crew of the missing plane were “All right, good night.”

Malaysian civil aviation officer Zulazri Mohd Ahnuar said he couldn’t confirm which member of the flight crew sent the message, which was transmitted from the plane back to Malaysian flight controllers as the aircraft transferred into Vietnamese airspace early Saturday.

For the families of those on board the missing plane, the wait for news is tortuous.

Danica Weeks is trying to keep it together for her two young sons, though the possibility of life without husband Paul, who was on the plane, is sometimes overwhelming. She’s clinging to hope even though, as Weeks said, it’s “not looking good.”

“Every day, it just seems like it’s an eternity, it’s an absolute eternity,” Weeks said from Australia. “We can only go minute by minute … and hope something comes soon.”###1861||Empty###1862||Hertz Global to raise $2.5 bn through equipment rental business spin-off

Hertz Global Holdings Inc, the largest US car rental company by sales, today said that it hoped to raise around $2.5 billion by spinning off its equipment rental business, in order to repay debt and focus on its core car rental business.

Hertz, which has come under attack from investors and adopted the ''poison pill'' strategy in December 2014 to ward off a hostile takeover from activist investors like Daniel Loeb's Third Point Capital, said its board of directors has approved plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.

The two companies will be "Hertz," comprising of the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly rental car businesses as well as Donlen, a provider of fleet leasing and management services, and "HERC," the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation.

The separation will be in tax-free spin-off to Hertz shareholders, and the company expects the separation of HERC to close by early 2015.

Hertz said that the proceeds would be also used to fund a new $1 billion share repurchase programme. This new share purchase replaces the $300 million share repurchase program that the company announced in 2013, under which Hertz has utilised around $87.5 million to repurchase its own shares.

"The actions announced today will create separate companies which we expect to benefit from improved financial profiles that include increased earnings stability and higher returns on capital," said Mark Frissora, chairman and CEO of Hertz.

"Our rental car and equipment rental businesses are leaders in their respective markets with valuable assets and tremendous long-term potential. Through unbundling these undervalued assets, we unleash current and future shareholder value.

Post separation, Hertz will remain a market leading rental car company with approximately 11,555 rental locations throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and New Zealand.

Following the separation, HERC will remain one of the largest and most diversified equipment rental businesses in the world with approximately 335 branches in the US, Canada, France, Spain, China and Saudi Arabia,

HERC rents a broad range of equipment, including aerial manlifts, air compressors and tools, earthmoving equipment and power generators, forklifts and material handling, pumps, and trucks and trailers.

HERC also generates revenues from the sale of new and used equipment and consumables as well as through its Hertz Entertainment Services division, which rents lighting and related aerial products used primarily in the US entertainment industry.

HERC had annual revenues of over $1.5 billion in 2013, with 38 per cent of its 2013 revenues generated from the construction market, 26 per cent from industrial, 36 per cent from other markets, including oil and gas, and from other specialty niche markets, such as pump and power, government services, and the entertainment industry.###1863||Empty###1864||Today, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney testified at a hearing of Parliament's Treasury Committee on the central bank's February Inflation Report. The Governor pushed his message that there is no rush to increase interest rates, saying that there may be more slack in the economy than the Bank estimated. He repeated that any rate increase will be gradual and limited and agreed with BoE Deputy Governor Charlie Bean statement that the benchmark rate will stay in a range of 2%-3% after increases begin. Specifically, Carney said: “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable sense to get across”. He said that spare capacity is “at the upper end” of the 1%-1.5% of GDP estimated by the BoE, while another MPC member testifying today said the level of spare capacity in UK may be overstated and is probably under 1%, underlining an area of divergence among BoE officials. On questions about the unemployment rate, the Governor said that recent data suggest a slowdown in the pace of decline in the unemployment rate. As for QE, he said that the Bank will consider unwinding its purchases only after several rate increases.

· The other noticeable economic event today was the release of Sweden’s CPI for February. The country remained in deflation for a second consecutive month (-0.2% yoy). The Krone fell on the news, but recovered within the next few minutes.###1865||It looks like you have reached this page in error ...

Live GBP Exchange Rates:

vs EUR: 1.1351

vs ZAR: 18.8069

vs USD: 1.3061

vs NZD: 1.9824

vs AUD: 1.8348

vs CAD: 1.7124

16:04: 1.6750 could still happen

"Pound is moving inside consolidation channel; market is going to continue this correction. We think, today price may form the third wave of this correction by falling down towards lower border of this trading range and reaching level of 1.6560. Later, in our opinion, instrument may return to level of 1.6750." - RoboForex.

15:42: Sterling under-performance continues

Piet Lammens at KBC Markets notes:

"The UK currency drifted lower as several BoE members attended a hearing on the inflation report before the Treasury committee of the UK parliament.

"Governor Carney said that he estimated the spare capacity in the UK economy slightly higher than the 1.0%/1.5% indicated last month. Sterling lost some further ground after these dovish comments. However, Carney’s view was not shared by all his colleagues. Whatever, EUR/GBP came again within reach of the 0.8350 resistance. Cable filled bids in the 1.66 area, but a real test of the 1.6583 ST range bottom didn’t occur."

14:54: Commerzbank still back the £ over the €

It's been a tough week for the UK currency, but analyst Karen Jones at Commerzbank says she continues to back the UK unit:

"While capped here (0.8348/49) and by Monday’s 0.8350 high, we will maintain our medium term negative bias. The odds favour at least a short-term break higher, though, in which case the 0.8391 late December high could be hit before the currency pair heads back down again. We look for a re-test of the 55 day moving average at 0.8272 and the 0.8253 December low in the first instance."

14:42: NIESR estimate GDP less than 1% below pre-recession peak

The NIESR monthly estimates of GDP suggest that output grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months ending in February after growth of 0.7 per cent in the three months ending in January 2014.

This implies that output is less than 1 per cent below its pre-recession peak (January 2008) and we expect this peak will be recovered over the course of 2014. NIESR do not anticipate that the Bank of England's MPC will adjust interest rates until the second quarter of 2015.

13:53: British pound at risk of steep sell-off

Now we hear from Schlossberg's colleague, Kathy Lien. This is interesting as she called this one on the AUD rally seen last month:

Regarding the extended long positioning in GBP-USD:

"Current positions are near their 5-year extremes, which makes GBP/USD particularly vulnerable to a sharp sell-off. In this chart, we highlighted points of reversal in positioning and how they have corresponded with nasty reversals in the GBP/USD. Coincidently, positioning topped out not far from current levels in past years. With only the trade balance report scheduled for release this week, additional profit taking could drive GBP/USD below its 3 week low of 1.6585, which would pave the way for a move down to 1.64."

13:40: Outlook for £ remains constructive

What can we glean for the £ from the MPC's appearance in front of the UK parliament today?

Boris Schlossberg at BK Assset Management has the following:

"Cable also remained steady holding above the 1.6600 mark as BoE Governor Carney testified in front of Parliament. Mr. Carney once again tried to dampen interest rate expectations as he noted that any rate hikes will be gradual and limited in nature. The BoE is keenly aware of cable recent strength which it considers to be a threat to the UK recovery especially the country's export sector. Nevertheless, UK economic performance appears to be expanding at a steady rate and markets anticipate that the BOE will be the first amongst the G-7 to hike rates, which should continue to provide support for sterling."

12:33: UK currency reversing momentum

Ipek Ozkardeskaya expresses surprise at the reverse in fortunes being suffered by the UK currency:

"GBPUSD extended weakness to 1.6615 this morning amid the industrial and manufacturing production data showed slightly lower-than-expected performance in January. Although the recovery has been slightly slower, the industrial and manufacturing production expanded at the faster pace of 2.9% (vs. 1.8% last) & 3.3% (vs. 1.5% last).

"The negative knee-jerk reaction in GBP (hardly justified) warns of building selling pressures in sterling. The issues on BoE FX manipulation clearly keep the negative pressures tight on sterling. Technically, the Cable’s MACD (12, 26) stands in the red zone, offers pre-1.6668 (former fibo 100% & 21-dma ) keep the upside limited."

11:43: Fresh selling pressure on sterling

It's been a roller-coaster of a morning. The pound is now under selling pressure once again with GBP-USD now testing key support at 1.60. There is no overt cause. The MPC testimony is ongoing, but there is no real headline thus far.

11:40: FX in late morning

"The USD is trading mostly higher so far today; the AUD and NZD are, however, both posting gains against all their G-10 peers. The European currencies are under-performing broadly, lead by the CHF but closely followed by the EUR which is giving up more of last week’s post-ECB gains. Asian equities were modestly higher but European markets have slipped into the red, pulling US futures down. Gold and oil are slightly firmer. It’s not really risk off but it’s not really risk on either." - Shaun Osborne at TD Securities.

10:25: GBP-EUR in recovery mode

A couple of things have pushed the GBP-EUR higher:

1) Mark Carney tells Parliament, "its best to adjust interest rates by more than 0.25% before reversing QE." This part of an on-script appearance, markets will be relieved that no 'bearish' tones have been expressed.

2) The ECB appears a little taken aback by the strength of the Euro's gains following on from last week's ECB meeting. We hear ECB member Constancio saying market did not completely take in the message from the March meeting. He says the ECB have tools on the table including rate cuts and QE. Will the ECB now take a more dovish tone from here to temper expectations?

09:33: Carney, MPC Testimony Live

Click below to watch the important appearance of key MPC members before the UK parliament:

09:32: GBP in muted reaction to IP data

IP data hasn't provided a boost to the UK currency. Today's ONS releases were all well in growth territory, but crucially markets wanted a little more.

Industrial Production (YoY) (Jan): 2.9% vs 3.0% expected and 1.9% last month.

Manufacturing Production (YoY) (Jan) 3.3% vs 3.3% expected and 1.4% and 1.9% last month.

08:57: Be prepared for MPC appearance before Treasury Select Committee

Apart from the Industrial Production data, we also have MPC members appearing before parliament.

Jeremy Cook at WorldFirst says:

"There may have been some sterling selling as well ahead of Carney’s testimony in front of the Treasury Select Committee due this morning. Carney – alongside Paul Fisher, David Miles and Martin Fisher – will testify in front of MPs on the changes to forward guidance outlined in the recent Quarterly Inflation Report. However, the pointed questions will more likely revolve around accusations that the Bank of England was complicit in some form of abuse in currency markets. We would wager that this will be Carney’s most uncomfortable appearance in front of TSC."

08:33: Are markets positioning away from the pound sterling?

An interesting comment from Piet Lammens at KBC Market suggests markets are no longer too keen on the UK currency:

"Last week, sterling held reasonably strong both against the euro and the dollar even as chances on additional ECB easing declined substantially after the ECB policy decision and as the dollar found a better bid after the US payrolls. However, this constructive sterling sentiment evaporated today. Sterling fell prey to a long squeeze, both against the euro and the dollar.

"We didn’t see an exact trigger. Technical considerations might have played a role as EUR/GBP did break above the 0.8300 barrier. In cable the topside had become tough as the 1.6823 resistance was/is a hard not to crack. M&A related news might have played a role, too (Vodafone reached a deal to buy Spanish cable group Ono).

"BoE’s Bean in a speech warned that further sterling strength wouldn’t be particularly helpful for UK exports. Sterling lost a few more ticks after these headlines but at that time most of the intraday losses were already on the screens. Whatever the reason, sterling faced a substantial setback. EUR/GBP tried a test of the 0.8350 range top, but a real break didn’t occur (yet)."

08:29: Outlook for sterling dollar exchange rate hit by negative technical signals

The extent of yesterday's decline in the pound dollar exchange rate were such that at last night's close of 1.6642 3 bearish technical signals formed.

This warns that the near-term outlook is likely to be negative. The tree are:

1) Short-Term Bearish Momentum

2) Short-Term Bearish Price Crosses Moving Average (21-day)

3) Short-Term BearishWilliams %R

Below: Momentum behind the Cable has taken a turn for the worse.



08:20: Soft tone to persist

More from Lloyds:

"GBP long positions have come under some pressure at the start of this week, and in the absence of some positive GBP news, the softer GBP tone may well continue. MPC members, Carney, Fisher, Miles and Weale speak before the Treasury Select Committee this morning, answering questions about the latest Quarterly Inflation report. Headlines will be a focus; however we expect the content to be largely in line with recent BoE rhetoric."

08:13: Industrial Production Data Dominates Outlook

There has been little to guide the British pound over the past 24 hours, however Tuesday will bring with it some data from the UK's manufacturing sector.

"industrial output data will likely attract some market interest this morning. The market is expecting a modest rise in both industrial and manufacturing activity in January. However, while our economists expect marginally firmer manufacturing activity, they forecast wider industrial activity to have stagnated in January, mainly reflecting a further decline in mining activity," say Lloyds Bank.###1873||Believe when we say we saw it coming! Mercedes-Benz India has announced the CKD production of the new 2014 Mercedes S-Class from its manufacturing facility in Chakan, Pune. The new S-Class is the most powerful luxury car to be produced by Mercedes India and currently has a waiting period of approximately 3 months.

CLICK HERE FOR OUR COMPREHENSIVE 2014 MERCEDES S CLASS REVIEW

Eberhard Kern, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India said “The S-Class has always set newer standards that have retained its accolade as “the best automobile in the world” with each generation. It truly embodies our DNA and aspiration of ‘the best or nothing’ in every aspect. No other car stands for Mercedes-Benz brand promise more than the S-Class and we are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the art production facility in Chakan, Pune. Quality has all along been the strength of Mercedes-Benz India, and the new S 500 production in India is set to take this success story even further. This also reiterates our commitment to bring world class manufacturing facilities in India to support our growth in the luxury automotive business”

“It is also our constant endeavor to incorporate our brand promise and drive excellence in every aspect of our business and customer engagement. The unique multilingual chauffeur training program is one such initiative specially designed for our discerning S-Class customers in India, which will enable our customers to truly enjoy the epitome of luxury on wheels” Mr. Kern further added.

Following the commencement of local production would be the arrival of the S350 CDI diesel variant of the new gen S Class. Quite obviously, the diesel variant has good chances of becoming an even bigger sales success than the S500 petrol model.###1874||Empty###1875||Choose the plan that’s right for you.

The leading online retailer is pushing its annual membership up by $20 to $99 a year, but it had suggested in its most recent quarterly earnings call that the price could have gone even higher.

It would have been better if Amazon had timed this uptick to coincide with the addition of new features. At least then, customers would have associated the increase with enhanced benefits. Still, this is the first increase to Amazon Prime since its inception nine years ago. Can customers really complain about a 25% uptick after nine years, compared with what inflation has done to their cable bills, transportation costs, or even movie outings?

Some folks will throw in the towel, of course. If Amazon's premium shopping platform had total pricing elasticity, it would have raised its prices years ago. However, Amazon clearly believes it can push through this rate increase, which will kick in later this month for new members and for when existing members hit their anniversary renewals. It will also be interesting to see whether those who stick around will find themselves spending even more to justify the steeper cover charge.

BOSTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attack on Herbalife on Tuesday and said he has evidence the U.S.-based nutrition and weight loss company is breaking direct-selling laws in China, its fastest growing market.

Ackman, who has placed a $1 billion short bet against Herbalife, said the company was making recruits pay an entry fee and letting distributors recruit new members, activities he said were illegal in China. He also said the company is disguising its sales to distributors as hourly consulting fees.

Herbalife said it follows local laws. Chinese regulators have yet to comment on the matter but direct sales models have recently come under fire in China, where authorities launched a probe in January into Herbalife’s rival NU Skin Enterprises Inc after state media reported that it brainwashed its members.

In a telephone presentation which lasted more than two hours and drew some 300 listeners, Ackman said the findings were a first step towards bringing his concerns about Herbalife to the attention of Chinese officials.

Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, hired research firm OTG to collect the evidence through interviews with Herbalife distributors in China. He was joined on the conference call by one of his lawyers, David Klafter, who said Herbalife is violating Chinese law.

“My understanding of the facts and law in China is yes, they are violating both civil and criminal law,” Klafter said on the conference call.

Legal experts in China, however, say laws governing direct selling are unclear and enforcement is often lax, which makes any tough regulatory action against Herbalife unlikely.

Some Chinese laws allow direct selling under limited conditions, while others ban so-called pyramid selling, when members make more money recruiting new members than selling the actual product.

“These firms are operating in a regulatory grey area in China, which gives less protection because you’ve got an uncertainty hanging over it,” said Ben Wootliff, Hong Kong-based general manager for global risk consultancy Control Risks.

“The law in China says one thing, if it’s actually enforced is a completely different thing.”

Corey Lindley, chief cfinancial officer at direct sales firm dTERRA and a former NU Skin executive in China, also said the regulator was unlikely to take strong action against Herbalife any time soon.

“I don’t doubt that because of all of this attention there will be some modest movement of some sort with the regulators just trying to be responsive to all of this, but I don’t think it will be material at all,” Lindley told Reuters.

Herbalife said sales in China rose more than 120 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, the fastest of any region worldwide, contributing about 10 percent to global sales last year. The company has 200,000 sales representatives in the country and uses a “unique marketing program” to meet Chinese regulations, it said in its latest annual report.

Herbalife has said it remains confident in its business in China and said it is in compliance with local laws.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT

Ackman publically accused Herbalife of running a pyramid scheme in December 2012 when he unveiled his $1 billion short position in the company’s shares. So far he has lost money on the bet as rivals such as Carl Icahn took the other side.

The company says its business is not a pyramid scheme.

Despite the paper losses, Ackman has said that he has found fresh evidence nearly daily that is convincing him to stick by his original bet. If Herbalife ceased to exist right now he would make a few billion dollars, he said.

But there is no sign yet that Herbalife is near collapse, particularly since no regulator has yet commented publicly about its intentions in spite of heavy lobbying from Ackman.

During the conference call, many participants asked why there are virtually no public stories about people who have lost their life savings on investments in Herbalife.

Ackman said civil rights groups have identified over 1,000 victims and that this firm has found roughly 200 victims. But he said many victims are reluctant to go public because they do not realize they have been cheated or are embarrassed about it. Also “a lot of Latino victims are undocumented and the last thing they will do is complain to the government,” Ackman said.

Fresh media attention, including a front page article in the New York Times on Monday, should help galvanize regulators into reviewing the matter, he said.

Herbalife’s share price closed down 1.16 percent at $65.39.###1878||Mortgage rates on conventional home purchase and refinance loans remained firm at Branch Banking and Trust (NYSE:BBT) on Tuesday, March 11.

Word leaked out that a criminal investigation and two committees in Congress were opening probes into the matter.

The Department of Justice is currently investigating whether any laws were broken by GM when it responded slowly to the problem with ignition switches in its compact card from 2003 to 2007.

The probe is through the New York U.S. Attorney’s Office said a person familiar with the situation. A spokesperson with the DOJ and GM refused to comment on the investigation reported a major news service.

The issue is why GM had waited until February to start its recall of more than 1.6 older model vehicles worldwide even after admitting they had known about the issue for more than 10 years. The faulty switches on the ignition have been tied to 31 crashes involving 13 deaths.

Committees in the Senate and House also are inquiring as to why the road safety watchdog of the government, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not take any action any sooner.

GM made an announcement last month that it would replace the ignition switches that can shut the car motors off unexpectedly. When that takes place, drivers lose the power brakes and power assisted steering resulting at times in loss of control of car.

The ignition slips from its run position to off or accessory, due partly from heavy key chains.

In addition, if the switch is not in the run position the air bags in the car might not inflate upon a crash.

A review of NHTSA files showed that drivers started complaining about the ignition switch problems in the early part of 2005, which was shortly after the first Cobalt by Chevrolet went on sale.

The Cobalt, the top-selling vehicle for GM in the small car range during the mid 2000s had 173 complaints filed for the engine stalling or the air bags not deploying, both symptoms of a problem with the ignition.

Many vehicle drivers reported they had problems with keys sticking inside the ignition in addition to the vehicle stalling.###1880||Poking the eurozone bear How will the eurozone survive its encounter with voters in the European Parliament election in May?

The conventional wisdom is that, when confronted by a bear, you should lie motionless until it loses interest (or assumes that you are dead) and leaves you alone. But there are different species of bear, with some more likely to be deterred by bold, purposeful action. The question is how to determine the right approach when terror incarnate is staring you in the face.

This scenario is helpful for thinking about the eurozone as it attempts to survive its next round of trials – beginning with the European Parliament election in May. Can it continue simply to ‘lie still’, hoping that no new shocks arise that diminish its economic health, if not threaten its survival?

Some take the sanguine view that the current ‘lie still’ approach is adequate to ensure that the eurozone economy does more than avoid decline. From their perspective, Germany’s decision over the last three years to permit actual and prospective transfers just large enough to prevent financial meltdown will somehow be enough to enable the eurozone finally to begin to recover from a half-decade of recession and stagnation.

But the fact is that these transfers – that is, European Stability Mechanism-financed bail-out programmes and the European Central Bank’s prospective ‘outright monetary transactions’ (OMT) bond-buying scheme – can do little more than fend off collapse. They cannot boost economic output, because they are conditional upon recipient countries’ continued pursuit of internal devaluation (lowering domestic wages and prices).

Reinvigorating the eurozone economy requires a more radical effort to resolve the inter-linked sovereign-debt and banking crises. Specifically, it demands sovereign-debt mutualisation through Eurobonds, and thus the elimination of eurozone countries’ fiscal sovereignty, and a full-fledged banking union with recapitalisation authority and shared deposit insurance – a far cry from the arrangement that has been agreed.

If Europe’s leaders continue to choose mild palliatives over bold tactics, the best-case scenario is a lacklustre recovery, with GDP growing at a 1%-2% annual rate. Unfortunately, this best case probably is not enough to prevent future sovereign-debt defaults in countries like Italy, Spain, and eventually even France. In other words, at some point, lying still will no longer be an option.

In fact, eurozone leaders might be spurred into action even sooner. While the prospect of OMT seems to be keeping financial shocks at bay, at least for now, a political shock seems increasingly likely, with voters reacting against the internal-devaluation policies that are fuelling high unemployment and undermining living standards. The upcoming European Parliament election could be just such a shock.

As it stands, Europe’s political class is committed to internal devaluation in all of the troubled eurozone economies. The alternative approach – dismantling the eurozone to allow for external devaluations – has thus become the playground of hitherto marginal political parties, which are now surging ahead in opinion polls.

In France, the groups concerned – the National Front and the Union of the Left – represent political extremes. In Italy, a more ideologically neutral anti-establishment force may arise, with a much sharper anti-euro focus than Beppe Grillo’s populist Five Star Movement, which emerged last year to become the country’s third-largest political force. As these parties gain traction, the euro’s chances of survival diminish.

The predicament of Europe’s political establishment stems from a combination of irrational fear and vain ambition. This is particularly apparent in France, where the monetary union has often been viewed as a tool for harnessing Germany’s economic strength to project power worldwide. Given that dismantling the eurozone would mean the end of the French establishment’s European project and would weaken Europe’s ability to advance its interests vis-à-vis global powers like the United States and China, ‘monetary anti-union’ is unthinkable.

France’s global ambition is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro. For example, in 2011, Edmond Alphandéry, a former economy minister, declared that a eurozone exit by a member country was as likely as a dollar exit by Texas or California. Here, on full display, was the wishful thinking that brought the euro into existence in the first place: its French architects dreamed of a Europe that could equal the US. That was always an illusory ambition, but it continues to cloud European leaders’ judgment.

The single currency’s advocates are right about one thing: political motives have always underpinned the establishment of monetary unions, from Latin America’s in the period from 1865 to 1927 to that between Ireland and Britain from 1922 to 1979. But they are missing a crucial point: politics is also the reason for these unions’ dissolution. When the economic costs and divergences become too much of a threat, the political will to do what it takes to ensure the common currency’s survival collapses.

Voter reaction against the euro may well force the eurozone to stop lying still and take real action. The question is whether that would mean that some or all eurozone countries must go their separate ways.

The filing comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures. The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.

It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide and last year announced it would open 20 new food outlets in Ontario in a franchise agreement with Hassoun Enterprises Ltd.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain’s image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn’t take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 per cent. It said its filing is designed to “allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy” as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.###1888||Do you know a young business professional under the age of 40 who deserves recognition for outstanding leadership, innovative ideas or dedication to the community?

Is your adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) about to adjust? You may not want to allow that.

At current mortgage rates, today’s ARMs are resetting near 4%, which is the highest since 2009. Today’s adjusting ARM rates also continue a 2-year streak during which refinancing an ARM garnered lower rates than refinancing one into a new ARM.

Prior to 2016, it’s paid to have a conventional adjustable rate mortgage. Today, not so much.

If you’ve been riding your ARM through its adjustments, you’ve benefitted from low rates. With market sentiment shifting, though, it’s time to consider a refinancing into something different—either a new ARM or a fixed-rate loan.

ARMs are expected to adjust higher through 2107 and into 2018 as well.

How does an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) work?

An adjustable-rate mortgage is a mortgage for which the interest rate can change (i.e. adjust) over time based on “market conditions”.

Sometimes, ARM mortgage rates adjust higher. Sometimes, ARM mortgage rates adjust lower. And, ARMs can be an excellent option for first-time home buyers.

However, ARM interest rates fluctuate for the homeowners who use them, ARMs carry a financial risk not present with fixed-rate loans. For example, when you use an ARM to finance your home, there is no way to know what your mortgage rate will be in 10 years.

Uncertainty can be frightening. It can be hugely rewarding, too.

Consider this: since 2003, nearly every U.S homeowner using a conventional ARM home loan “beat the bank” on their mortgage. This is because, between 2003 and late-2015, adjustable-rate mortgages adjusted below the rates you could get on a “brand-new” loan (and with no closing costs required!).

That streak ended in December 2015, though, when the Federal Reserve raised the Fed Funds Rate from its target range near zero. When the Fed raises the Fed Funds Rate, it can affect the drivers for an adjusting ARM.

As a quick refresher, here’s how adjustable-rate mortgages work.

For a fixed period of time, usually 5 or 7 years, your mortgage rate is constant When the fixed period ends, your rate adjusts according to a preset formula Once annually thereafter, your rate adjusts using the same preset formula

The preset formula is a simple one. The new rate for the adjustable-rate mortgage is the sum of some variable market rate — typically the 12-month LIBOR — and a predetermined constant, which is typically 2.25 percent.

Adding the constant and the variable shows your new rate. Today, that sum is (2.25) + (1.7), or 3.95%.

3.95% is a low mortgage rate, but it’s higher than what you could get for a new 5-year ARM from an approved mortgage lender. According to Freddie Mac, new 5-year ARMs average 3.20 percent nationwide.

However, with a new ARM, there are closing costs to pay.

For example, in order to lock the 3.20% 5-year ARM rate shown by Freddie Mac, borrowers are expected to pay 0.5 discount points to the lender. And, closing costs apply, too.

If you prefer to let your loan adjust, you won’t get access to the 3.20% rate — but you won’t be responsible for closing costs, either. This is because, with an adjusting loan, there are no appraisals, no verifications of your income, and no credit check required.

In addition, an adjusting loan requires no underwriting and no fees paid to title companies. You’re not even required to have a job.

So, there are reasons to refinance away from your adjusting ARM, but allowing an adjustment can make sense to your cash flow, too.

Should you refinance from ARM to fixed?

If your current loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage and the loan is about to adjust, you have a decision to made as a homeowner — should I let my ARM adjust or should I refinance it?

In all, there are three options for your adjusting ARM :

Do nothing. Let your loan adjust; revisit mortgage rates again next year Refinance your ARM to a new ARM at today’s ARM mortgage rates Refinance your ARM to a new fixed rate loan at today’s fixed rate pricing

Each option has merits.

If you allow your ARM to adjust (Option 1), your lender will assign a new mortgage rate based on today’s LIBOR. Most homeowners will get a rate near 3.95% which will be assigned for the 12 months. The payment on a 3.95% mortgage rate is $475 for every $100,000 owed.

You can also refinance your ARM into new adjustable-rate loan.

Via a new ARM, you can lock your rate for the next 5 or 7 years or longer, depending on your needs. You’ll postpone the adjustments of a recasting ARM and, according to Freddie Mac’s most recent mortgage rate survey, will get an average rate of 3.20% for a 5-year ARM for an accompanying, one-time fee of 0.5 discount points.

The payment on a new ARM is $430 per $100,000, which saves $45 monthly but which is also subject to closing costs which could add up to the thousands, depending on in which state you live.

Lastly, you have the option of switching your ARM into a fixed-rate loan.

This is the most common way homeowners remove the uncertainty of “changing mortgage rates” and, according to quarterly refinance reports from the government, 66% of homeowners with ARMs make this choice.

Refinancing your ARM into a fixed-rate loan can be a good fit for several reasons — especially if you expect that the economy will improve this year or next, and you plan to stay in your home for a few more years.

An improving economy moves LIBOR rates higher and LIBOR is the basis for your adjusted ARM mortgage rate. With a fixed-rate mortgage, you’ll get a stable monthly because your interest rate is fixed and so is your payment.

The downside is that fixed-rate mortgages are roughly 100 basis points (1.00%) higher than comparable ARM mortgage rates, which means that your “stable payment” might be higher than your adjusted one.

Refinance your ARM to another ARM

Before you refinance your ARM, you need to know a couple of things:

How long do you expect to keep your loan now?

What are your ARM interest rate and payment likely to be?

Will you save money by refinancing?

Can you sleep at night without a fixed loan?

If the answer to the last question is a resounding “no,” get yourself to a lender and get yourself a fixed-rate refinance.

End of story.

However, if you expect to have your home and your mortgage for just a few years more, you may save a ton, again, with a new 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 or 10/1 ARM.

Your first step is determining what would happen to your ARM if it were adjusting today, and what it’s likely to do in the near future.

To do this, you need to look at your loan paperwork and find your loan’s index, margin and caps.

Suppose you have an ARM with a two-percent-per-year cap, a 2.25 percent margin and a five percent lifetime cap. Today’s LIBOR index is near 1.70 percent, so if your loan were resetting today, your new rate would be 3.95 percent. If your current rate is 3.0 percent, your increase is only 0.95 percent, and that new rate is good for another year.

But what about subsequent years? Here are a few more figures for you.

The median value of the 1-Year LIBOR over the last 20 years is 1.90 percent. If your loan were resetting based on that value, your new rate would be 4.15 percent.

The highest rate your loan could hit at its next adjustment is 5.95 percent, because your per-year adjustment cap is two percent.

The highest rate your loan could reach in its lifetime is 8.0 percent, because its lifetime cap is five percent.

The Federal Reserve believes that by the end of 2017, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will rise to 4.6 percent, and 15-year fixed mortgage rates will hit 3.8 percent.

Right now, ARMs just don’t look that scary.

An in-depth explanation of ARM caps

Dig out your loan agreement, and there’s a very good chance you’ll discover up to three sorts of caps that limit the amount your rate (and therefore your payments) can rise.

These caps vary from mortgage to mortgage, so you need to do a bit of reading to find the protections yours provides.

Periodic adjustment caps

The first sort is intended to prevent sudden hikes that could be hard to absorb in your household budget. It sets a top limit (often two percent) on the amount by which your mortgage rate can rise each year.

You’ve probably seen these mortgages described as 3/1 ARMs, 5/1 ARMs, 7/1 ARMs and similar. The first number specifies the initial fixed-rate period in years, and the second shows (again in years) how often hikes are allowed after that. So a 5/1 ARM has five years fixed, and then permits rate increases every one year.

Payment caps

The second type of cap applies to your monthly payments rather than interest rates. It might, for example, say those monthly payments can’t rise at any one time by more than a certain amount.

Suppose that particular cap is set at 7.5 percent in your loan agreement, and you’re currently paying $1,000 a month. At most, you’d pay an extra $75 a month when your next hike is implemented.

Lifetime caps

The third sort of cap limits the amount by which your interest rate can rise in total over the lifetime of your loan.

Check your caps, and use The Mortgage Reports mortgage calculator to model how different rate increases might impact your payments.

These three types of cap together mean that even if interest rates suddenly soar, your exposure doesn’t. That doesn’t mean you won’t face some pain, but it’s probably less scary than you think.

How long will you keep your home and loan?

The first question may be the most important. If your current home is your “forever home,” a fixed-rate mortgage might be your best bet, because it gives you the certainty and security of knowing your first monthly payment will be the same as your last: You know, the one when you become mortgage-free.

But if you’re likely to move or refinance again anyway sometime in the next few years, it may not be worth paying the higher rates that typically come with fixed rates.

So how likely is it you’ll move again to a new job? Perhaps to somewhere bigger to accommodate more kids or aging parents? Or to a downsized home? Maybe to a smarter neighborhood? Or, heaven forbid, to a post-divorce home?

Few people can answer those questions with total certainty. But your best guess could save you paying too high a rate for either an FRM or a longer-than-necessary fixed-rate period on your new ARM.

Adjustable-rate mortgages can be “safe”

An adjustable-rate mortgage is a mortgage for which the interest rate can change over time. Commonly abbreviated as “ARM”, the adjustable rate mortgage is the opposite of the fixed-rate mortgage.

Adjustable-rate mortgages are available for most common loan types. You can use ARMs for conventional financing via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and with FHA loans and VA loans, too.

Only USDA loans prohibit the use of adjustable-rate financing.

The rules for how an adjustable-rate mortgage include two very important points. First, because the mortgage rate of an ARM doesn’t change during its initial “teaser” period, during these first few years, an ARM behaves identically to a fixed-rate mortgage.

Second, when an ARM enters its adjustment phase, there are rules which govern by how much it can adjust in any given year. 5-year ARMs, for example, are capped to adjustments of ±2% per year, with the rate never allowed to move more than six percent from its starting rate.

As an illustration, with a 5-year ARM, the ARM mortgage rate remains unchanged for the first 60 months, and then it can adjust. The new mortgage rate after 60 months is equal to the then-current 1-Year LIBOR rate, plus 225 basis points (2.25%).

With LIBOR currently near 1.73, today’s ARMs are adjusting to near 3.98 percent.

Keep in mind, though, that there are limits to how much the rate can rise.

A loan with an initial rate of 3.25% can never rise more than 9.25% if it has a 6% lifetime cap (3.25% + 6% = 9.25%).

Rates for an ARM can never reach 20%, nor can they fall to zero. They can only move within six percentage points of the original starting rate. There is safety in today’s ARMs — you always know the maximum by which your rate can change on its adjustment dates.

It’s not because it makes it easier or more profitable for physicians.

Studies have shown that people without health insurance are less likely to take medicines they need, get less preventative care and are at greater risk for preventable death. They also experience higher costs when they access health care. For example, only 30 percent of uninsured women get mammograms vs. 50 percent of insured women. Fifty four percent of uninsured persons forgo treatment, prescriptions and follow-up doctor appointments vs. 21 percent of the insured. Uninsured persons are four times more likely to be hospitalized for conditions such as asthma, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and ulcers, and most of these hospitalizations are related to lack of preventative care and regular doctor visits, according to a study by the American College of Physicians.

If you are uninsured, you’re not the only one at risk. Your families may place themselves at risk to help pay your bills. Your co-workers suffer when you call in sick more often. Society suffers from supporting unnecessary disability payments or to sustain hospitals providing unpaid care.

Shanghai copper has dropped by its 5 per cent daily limit to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country’s first domestic bond default last week.

The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has plunged 5 per cent to 46,670 yuan ($US7600) a tonne, its lowest since September 2009.

On the Comex in New York, copper futures for delivery in May slid as much as 2.8 per cent to $US2.9955 a pound, the lowest intraday level since June 25, and last traded at $US3.0205 in Tokyo. The metal fell 4.2 per cent on Friday, the biggest drop since December 2011, and dropped 3.3 per cent last week.

‘‘It’s a bit of panic selling on concern that China’s demand is slowing,’’ said Kazuhiko Saito, a Tokyo-based analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi. ‘‘China is driving industrial metals lower.’’###1909||Why did this happen?

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday that the number of job openings increased slightly from December to January, from 3.91 to 3.97 million. Hires fell from 4.58 to 4.54 million. Both numbers are well below their prerecession numbers. Hires, in particular, regularly clocked in at more than 5 million over the course of the mid-1990s economic expansion.

And there were few hints in the BLS' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey that January's weak results were the product of bad weather that has been blamed for a recent spate of bad economic news rather than underlying problems in the economy. Hiring picked up in some weather-sensitive industries, such as construction, and in the South, which suffered some of the most unusually harsh winter conditions.

Although labor market churn — the pace of job creation and separations — has picked up steadily over the course of the past few years, there are no signs of an accelerating recovery.

The ratio of unemployed workers to job openings, a measure of overall slack, is only now near the lowest levels it reached in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble:



And the quits rate, which can be used as an indicator of labor market health because it represents workers voluntarily leaving their jobs, is also only now nearing the worst rates seen before before the housing bubble collapse:



The pace of hiring has been fast enough to bring the headline unemployment rate down a full percentage point over the course of the past year.

But millions of workers lost their jobs and gave up looking for work during the recession, meaning that they are not included in the headline unemployment rate. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, taking such discouraged workers into account, there are about 6 million Americans who need jobs.

As businesses create more openings and hire more workers, that backlog should be reduced, raising the labor force participation rate and ultimately cutting into the high number of long-term unemployed workers.###1911||At 04:20 London time, three-month copper stood at $6,680 per tonne, down $16 from its opening price.

After closing 155 of its corporate-run locations, the Long Island-based pizza chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it tries to settle $500 million in debt.

Sbarro LLC, the Melville-headquartered pizza chain originally based out of Brooklyn has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three years. A common sight in malls and airports across America, the chain closed down 155 of its corporate-owned US locations last month in an effort to return to profitability and has now petitioned a US Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for Chapter 11 in hopes that it will be able to quickly settle some of its $500 million debt; the company also listed its total assets around the $500 million mark.

Holders of the company’s debt have already expressed support for the filing, and a group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing as Sbarro attempts to reorganize and cut away at $140 million of the money it owes according to Bloomberg News.

“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,” said Chairman and CEO David Karam. Karam was previously an executive at Wendy’s before joining Sbarro in March of 2013.

The bankruptcy will not impact the pizza chain’s 600 global franchises, nor were any of the February closures stores run by franchise operators. Long Island saw three of its seven Sbarro locations shut down due to underperformance. Food court locations in Broadway Mall, Green Acres Mall, and Sunrise Mall were all shuttered; the Smithaven Mall location is still open, as are the two Mama Sbarro locations in Hauppauge and Deer Park, and the Sbarro-owned Umberto’s of Huntington. 220 company-run locations remain open in the US.

Sbarro previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011 and began to report losses in 2008 due to the rising cost of ingredients such as flour, pasta, and cheese. During that first bankruptcy the chain was able to eliminate 70% of its debt and emerge from Chapter 11 by November of the same year. Despite the company’s troubles in the United States, it opened 81 new locations around the world last year.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday at a press conference in Beijing after the closing meeting of the second annual session of China's 12th National People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament, said future defaults of financial products in China are “unavoidable” but the government will take measures to ensure they do not pose a threat to the wider financial system. The premier also said that economic growth would be kept in a reasonable range in 2014.

The premier said China needs to step up supervision of financial risks and he added that "isolated cases" of debt default were difficult to avoid.



"We must strengthen monitoring and deal with the problems in a timely way to make sure there are no systemic or regional risks," he said and added that a national audit of local government debt last year showed that debt risks are controllable overall.

Last week China had its first domestic bond default in modern times when Chaori Solar, a solar panel producer, failed to pay interest on Rmb¥1bn ($162m) worth of bonds it sold two years ago.

Bloomberg News reports that credit-default swaps to protect Chinese sovereign bonds from non-payment for five years climbed to 95.8 basis points or 0.958% yesterday, the highest since Feb. 5, according to prices from data provider CMA.

“We could see more defaults, not limited to solar companies but also in industries with excess capacity like steel and mining,” Steve Wang, head of fixed-income research in Hong Kong at BOCI Securities Ltd told Bloomberg. "Trust products may also face defaults, he said.

"We are not preoccupied with GDP growth," Li said, adding that jobs and income levels as well as controlling pollution were important goals.

Meanwhile, Xinhua, China's official news agency, reported that China's urban fixed-asset investment grew 17.9% year on year in the first two months of 2014, down from the 21.2% growth registered in the same period of last year, official data showed today.

The growth rate was 1.7%age points lower than the full-year pace of 2013, as China's economy still faces downward pressure, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced on Thursday.

Urban fixed-asset investment amounted to Rmb¥3.03tn (US$494.13bn) during January and February, with the growth pace in February up 1.33%age points on a month-to-month basis.

China's retail sales grew 11.8% year on year to Rmb¥4.23tn ($690bn) in the first two months of the year, the NBS also said Thursday.

The growth rate was 13.6% in December.

China's industrial added value expanded 8.6% year on year in the first two months of 2014, official figures revealed on Thursday.

On a month-to-month basis, industrial added value in February edged up slightly by 0.61% from the previous month, the NBS added.

China uses industrial added value to measure business activities of designated large enterprises with an annual turnover of at least Rmb¥20m ($3.26m) each.

The statistics showed that the added value of state-owned enterprises saw 4.4% growth in the two months, while joint stock companies ended the period with 9.9% growth.

* Producer prices edge down 0.1 percent in February

By Jason Lange

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment weakened in early March as an unusually harsh winter appeared to dim views on the economy’s prospects.

The preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell to 79.9 in March from 81.6 the prior month, a survey showed on Friday.

Analysts had expected sentiment to improve, and the weak tone of the report could be a sign that severe weather had put consumers in the doldrums. That would back the view that the U.S. economy was only temporarily stuck in a soft patch and would resume stronger growth once the weather improves.

“Most of the decline ... can be attributed to the unseasonably bad weather,” said Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

Parts of the United States have suffered colder-than-normal temperatures and blizzards over the winter, which may have contributed to several months of weak hiring.

If weather is the culprit, then the Federal Reserve can feel more confident about continuing the winding down of a bond-buying stimulus program. The Fed started trimming monthly bond purchases in January.

The sentiment index was at its lowest level since November. It was largely dragged down by a dip in consumer expectations for future growth.

There were some signs of strength in the report. Those polled expected the highest rate of annual income gains since November 2008.

“Expectations of income gains were ... consistent with a tightening labor market,” said Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York.

A separate report from the Labor Department pointed in the opposite direction with regard to inflation, as a decline in U.S. producer prices in February suggested little building of inflationary pressure.

The government’s seasonally adjusted producer price index for final demand dropped 0.1 percent last month.

On its own, the price data would make policymakers feel more comfortable holding interest rates near zero for many more months.

“There is nothing in this report that raises any concerns about inflation,” said John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. “The economy is running too far below capacity for that to happen.

U.S. inflation has held at a very low level in recent years because of a persistently high unemployment rate.

The value of the U.S. dollar slipped against the yen following the price data’s publication, suggesting investors felt the report buttressed the view that the Fed would hold interest rates extremely low into next year.

Prices for U.S. stocks and yields on U.S. government debt fell on heightened tensions over a possible U.S.-European response against Russia if a referendum in Ukraine’s Crimea region goes ahead.

Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a slight increase in prices received last month by businesses such as factories, retailers and wholesalers. The price index had risen 0.2 percent in January.

Final demand for goods rose 0.4 percent in February. Final demand for services dropped 0.3 percent. The Labor Department said about 80 percent of the decline in its services index was due to lower margins for retailers of apparel, footwear and accessories.

In the 12 months through February, producer prices increased 0.9 percent, the smallest one-year gain since May 2013.

Producer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs fell 0.2 percent. Another gauge of core producer prices - final demand less foods, energy, and trade services - nudged up 0.1 percent.###1921||Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

With the mystery over what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 still raising questions for the world’s air crash investigators, one company are hoping that the power of crowds might be able to help solve the most basic of problems: where did the plane crash?

With thousands of miles of ocean to scour, narrowing down where the wreckage is makes for a challenge – but according to ABC News, DigitalGlobe have a potential solution. They’ve trained five satellite cameras on to the region and have split up the resulting high-resolution images into thousands of smaller ones. To sort through all of this data quickly, they want to enlist the general public to help.

If you head over to the Tomnod website, you can start to sift through some of the images picked at random – marking any that look suspicious or as though they may contain debris. If thousands of people do this then the firm can then use an algorithm to figure out which images are provoking the most interest, and hand them over to the experts for them to check out.

“We’ll say, ‘Here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations,'” the ABC article quotes DigitalGlobe’s Luke Barrington as saying. “Is it really an aircraft wing that’s been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I’d start.”

This isn’t the first time this sort of crowdsourcing has been used to tackle problems involving large volumes of data – the website Galaxy Zoo has long pioneered this technique for the somewhat happier task of identifying and classifying new galaxies from photos taken by space telescopes.

In fact, DigitalGlobe have also tried this once before – when they partnered with Amazon to attempt to locate adventurer Steve Fossett, who went missing when flying over Nevada in 2007. Shortly after, many critics of the crowdsourcing dubbed it a waste of time.

So will this latest effort help solve the Malaysia mystery? Obviously we hope so. Head over to###1925||A week after the collapse of Mt. Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.

In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered - or more often, not covered - by existing law.

The issue took on new prominence in Japan on Feb. 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.

Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, "we have not grasped the situation in its entirety."

The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.

Fewer than 1 percent of Mt. Gox's 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.

"It's not money," said Finance Minister Taro Aso. "Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?" he asked at a regular news conference. "Opinions are divided."

The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.

But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.

Regarding money laundering, certain transactions - whether with bitcoin or not - require people to identify themselves, it notes.

The 6-page document is the government's official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.###1926||US Navy Seals take control of North Korean oil tanker in Libya

Washington: US Navy Seals boarded and took control of a North Korea-flagged tanker that had loaded crude oil at a port held by rebels in eastern Libya, the Pentagon said on Monday.

No one was hurt "when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

The operation was approved by President and was conducted just after 0200 GMT Monday "in international waters southeast of Cyprus."

The Morning Glory "is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra," the statement read.

The tanker will be "underway soon to a port in Libya" with a team of US sailors aboard.

The Morning Glory, which departed from the eastern Libyan port of Al-Sidra -- controlled by rebels seeking autonomy from the authorities in Tripoli -- is reported to have loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude.

Pyongyang on Wednesday however denied any responsibility for the tanker.

The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.

Pyongyang had "cancelled and deleted" the ship's North Korean registry, as it violated its law "on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo".

"Therefore, the ship has nothing to do" with North Korea, which "has no responsibility whatsoever as regards the ship," KCNA said.###1927||2014/03/13 16:01

BEIJING, March 13 (Yonhap) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged the United States on Thursday to focus on mutual interests, admitting some "frictions" in their bilateral ties amid tensions with Washington over Beijing's increasingly assertive naval reach in Asia and maritime disputes with its neighbors.

Speaking at his annual press conference, Li, however, gave a relatively upbeat assessment about the prospect of the relationship between the world's top two economies and militaries, saying, "There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of China-U.S. cooperation. We need to make the most of our complementarity."



China's rise and military modernization have increased tensions with its Asian neighbors at a time when it is embroiled in bitter territorial disputes with Japan and other nations over islands in the East China Sea and South China Sea.

The maritime disputes, along with North Korea's nuclear standoff, are the region's top security headaches as the U.S. has taken steps to expand security cooperation with its Asian nations as part of its "pivot to Asia" policy.

"China and the United States are different in history, culture and stage of development," Li told reporters. "So, it's only natural that these two countries have some differences, and they also have differences or frictions in the course of their cooperation."



"But I believe that these are the pains amidst growing cooperation," Li said.

Li, China's No. 2 leader, made no mention of specific issues on regional security concerns, with his two-hour-long press conference largely focusing on the economy and other domestic matters.

However, Li stressed his country's "unwavering commitment to pursuing peaceful development and unshakable will in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity."



"As long as the two sides respect each other's core interests and major concerns and properly manage their differences, these two countries will be able to further raise the level of their relationship."



"The common interests between China and the United States far outweigh their differences," Li said.

"As the Chinese saying goes, 'the wise will seek common interests, while the unwise focus on their differences,' " Li said. "China and the United States need to focus more on common grounds and pursue long-term benefits."



Li held the press conference at the end of China's annual legislative session, which has been overshadowed by news of a Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared last week with 239 people including 150 Chinese on board.

The premier said China will step up search efforts "as long as there is a glimmer of hope," adding that "Those people's families and friends are burning with anxiety."

BOSTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Steven A. Cohen, whose hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading, is changing the name of his firm to Point72 Asset Management as it shifts focus to managing his own assets from serving as a hedge fund for wealthy investors following an agreement with the U.S. government.

"SAC will give way to a new flagship name for the parent holding company, Point72 Asset Management, where our management and back office employees will primarily reside," Tom Conheeney, SAC's president, wrote to employees in a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Speculation had been mounting on Wall Street over what Cohen would call his firm and whether he might move out of the office building at 72 Cummings Point Road in Stamford, Connecticut, now that the firm is taking on a smaller footprint.

The name change reflects the firm's expectation that it will remain in Stamford at its headquarters "for many years to come," Conheeney's letter said. It is also meant to signal a new beginning for the firm. "We have been through a great deal during the past few years. Our new names, combined with the other changes we have announced, are intended to help us to move forward," he wrote.

The two new long/short trading divisions will do business as Point72 Asset Management (Point72) and EverPoint Asset Management (EverPoint). The MultiQuant business will operate as Cubist Systematic Strategies (Cubis).

The new names will become effective on April 7, completing the firm's transformation from a hedge fund, which oversaw $14 billion for wealthy clients at the start of last year, to a family office which will primarily manage Steven A. Cohen's personal fortune, estimated most recently by Forbes at $11 billion.

SAC was forced to stop managing outside money as part of its plea with the U.S. government when it agreed in November to pay $1.2 billion to settle securities fraud charges.

All eyes will be on the Federal Reserve this week, when the central bank concludes its first two-day policy meeting of the Janet Yellen era and Yellen will conduct her first press conference as head of the central bank.

Despite the recent turmoil in some emerging markets, the slowdown in Chinese activity, the events in Ukraine and weaker, weather-related US economic data, the Fed will likely announce another $10 billion dollar cut at this meeting, reducing monthly bond purchases to $55 billion dollars.

The two looming risks are China and Ukraine, but neither situation is likely to deter the Fed from acting at this FOMC meeting. While China appears to be slowing, it is important to note the context: the much larger size of the Chinese economy today, versus double-digit growth in the past, means that 7 percent increases are potentially just as big as those in the 2000’s. Additionally, the Chinese government is actually engineering the slower rate, which means that if growth slows down too much, the government can easily push policy levers in the opposite direction.

With regard to Ukraine, if the situation results in a prolonged diplomatic stalemate, markets are likely to remain subdued. But if there were worsening violence or an escalation to a full-blown trade war, the impact would be more severe.

Regardless of events in China and Ukraine, there is some anticipation that the Fed will discuss the conditions under which it would finally raise interest rates, which have been at 0 – 0.25 percent since December of 2008 (pity the beleaguered savers!) The so-called “forward guidance” is meant to provide investors with a clear understanding of the Fed’s next steps, but one economist’s clarity is another’s murkiness.

The central bank is expected to abandon the quantitative approach that Ben Bernanke first mentioned in 2012. At the time, the then Fed Chief said that when the nation’s unemployment rate dropped below 6.5 percent, it would be a trigger for increasing short-term interest rates. But since that time, the unemployment rate has fallen faster than expected and has now come to be seen as a red herring for the recovery.

At the January FOMC meeting, officials said that they would not raise rates until the unemployment rate has fallen “well past” 6.5 percent, but there is a possibility that the Fed may adopt and communicate a qualitative approach, which would include a wider range of labor market indicators without any set numerical targets. The net effect for all of those savers: Be prepared for rock-bottom rates for at least another year.

Justice Department is reportedly probing GM ignition recall

The Justice Department has reportedly opened a preliminary criminal investigation into General Motors’ delayed recall of cars with faulty ignitions, several news outlets are reporting.

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney’s office in New York did not comment on the report, the Associated Press reports. Among the news outlets reporting the probe, based on anonymous sources, are AP, the New York Times and Bloomberg News, which had the story first.

GM had collected complaints about the faulty ignitions for a decade, but didn’t issue a recall until February. The faulty ignitions, which shut off unexpectedly, have been linked to 13 deaths. A source told the Times that prosecutors are investigating whether GM downplayed the problem to federal regulators.

Congressional committees, meanwhile, plan hearings to learn why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn’t act.

GM has hired Jenner & Block chairman Anton Valukas to lead its internal investigation of the delayed recall. King & Spaulding will also aid the investigation.###1942||Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) continues to hammer the proposed Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal in very public venues, including telling CBS that he has gotten 60,000 responses to an e-mail soliciting input on Comcast cable service and the news for Comcast isn't good.

In an interview with CBS This Morning, a transcript of which the network was sending out to other news outlets Monday, Franken said: “I got 60,000 responses, and believe me, people don’t like their service from Comcast, and they don’t think this deal is going to help them,” he said.

In a survey posted to Franken's campaign Web site last month (he is running for re-election in the fall), Franken asked for help from consumers in protecting them from "skyrocketing cable rates." The survey asks questions about price and service quality, but also whether they "feel like" they have a choice "when it comes to cable service."

In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper following the proposed deal's announcement last month, Franken said there needed to be more competition, not less. Asked how that could be achieved, Franken said: "We don't allow the two biggest companies to merge. That's how we have more competition." He quickly added that the Senate needed to look at the deal and that he "had not come down one way or the other."

But in the CBS interview, Franken was asked whether there was anything that would make the deal OK with him, his response was that he was "against this right now, from everything I have seen."

When Norah O'Donnell suggested the deal would probably go through, Franken said he thought there was a "a little bit of a too-cozy relationship between Comcast and the regulators," but did not elaborate. He opposed the Comcast/NBCU deal, which the FCC approved with conditions, though Franken has complained those conditions were not always honored.

An FCC spokesperson declined to comment on the "cozy" characterization.

One not-so cozy relationship Comcast has with the commission was the FCC's finding that Comcast had not complied with the news neighborhooding condition when it came to Bloomberg's business news channel, although Comcast maintains it did not violate that condition.

Comcast declined comment on Franken's latest criticisms, but has said previously that the company is "proud of our track-record on complying with the conditions from our past transactions including NBCUniversal."###1943||Empty###1944||Enter your user name and password in the fields above to gain access to the subscriber content on this site.

Investigators also were examining a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one of the pilots and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government announced findings that strongly suggested the plane was deliberately diverted and may have flown as far north as Central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communications systems — the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS — about 40 minutes after takeoff. The ACARS equipment sends information about the jet’s engines and other data to the airline.

About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems was also shut down. The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane’s disappearance was deliberate.

On Sunday, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit — “All right, good night” — were spoken to air traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang told reporters he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air traffic controllers.

Given the expanse of land and water that might need to be searched, finding the wreckage could take months or longer. Or it might never be located. Establishing what happened with any degree of certainty will probably require evidence from cockpit voice recordings and the plane’s flight-data recorders.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

“The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,” he said. “It has now become even more difficult.”

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he has asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane’s final movements.

With more information, he said, the search zone could be narrowed “to an area that is more feasible.”

Investigators have said the last known position of the plane could be anywhere on a huge arc spanning from Kazakhstan down to the southern stretches of the Indian Ocean. Given that a northern route would have sent the plane over countries with busy airspace, most experts say the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. The southern Indian Ocean is the world’s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

Australia has a powerful military radar system with an approximate range of 3,000 kilometres (1,900 miles) used to monitor the Indian Ocean west of the country. But the radar would have to have been pointed in the right direction at the right time to have picked up detailed flight activity, said John Blaxland of the Australian National University’s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre.

Without any alarms triggered at the time, the radar data probably would have recorded at most a blip on a screen, which likely wouldn’t provide enough information to track the plane, Blaxland said Monday.

“So to expect that’s going to deliver some kind of miraculous tracking of an aircraft over a week ago … I think we might be a bit disappointed,” Blaxland said.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he will speak with Malaysian officials Monday to see if they wanted additional search help.

Asked whether any Australian agency had picked up any information suggesting the plane flew near Australia, Abbott said: “I don’t have any information to that effect, but all of our agencies that could possibly help in this area are scouring their data to see if there’s anything they can add to the understanding of this mystery.”

Malaysia is leading the search for the plane and the investigation into its disappearance.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the FBI was supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC’s “This Week” that so far “there’s nothing out there indicating it’s terrorists.”

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Malaysia’s police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said he asked countries with citizens on board the plane to investigate their backgrounds, no doubt looking for anyone with terrorism ties, aviation skills or prior contact with the pilots. He said that the intelligence agencies of some countries had already done so and found nothing suspicious, but he was waiting for others to respond.

Police searched the homes of both pilots Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities “didn’t see the necessity in the early stages.”

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Zaharie, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories. Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said the simulator was not in itself cause for any suspicion.

Malaysian police were also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last “ping” was sent out at 8:11 a.m. — 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia or far into the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people believe the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility it may have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defence minister, said it was possible for the plane to “ping” when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were up and running.

Australia said it was sending one of its two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search to remote islands in the Indian Ocean at Malaysia’s request. The plane will search the north and west of the Cocos Islands, a remote Australian territory with an airstrip about 1,200 kilometres (745 miles) southwest of Indonesia, military chief Gen. David Hurley said.

Whoever disabled the plane’s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Blue chips underperformed as a result of losses in Boeing ( BA ) and the financial sector, but the Nasdaq Composite squeezed out a very small gain, snapping a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 closed just in positive territory.

Global equities were undermined by the recent Chinese default along with forecasts for more downbeat economic data tonight on retail sales and industrial production. Coming on the heels of bearish Chinese trade data, the impact a slowdown in the world's second largest economy will have on Europe unnerved investors across the globe, magnified by a four-year low in copper, an industrial metal considered a barometer to Chinese manufacturing activity.

In corporate news, reverberations from New Jersey's decision to ban direct sales to consumers continued to undermine shares of Tesla ( TSLA ), while investors bailed on General Motors ( GM ) amid allegations by the Justice Department that the car maker may have broken the law by ignoring an ignition defect for more than 10 years. Shares of Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC ) tumbled following the decision by the Senate Banking Committee to dismantle the government-owned mortgage lenders.

A panel on the wing of Delta Flight 2412, flying from Orlando to Atlanta, came undone yesterday but the pilots managed to land the flight without incident.



The wing panel fell-off as the aircraft was mid-air, leaving gears and wiring uncovered.



Delta spokesman Anthony Black told NBC News that the missing panel, which fell off in mid-air on Flight 2412, did not affect the plane’s “ability to fly or land.”



As a precaution, the crew declared an emergency on approach, and the plane was towed to the gate after it landed, Black was further quoted. None of the passengers or crew members was injured.



ABC News quotes passenger David Watterson, who was on the flight and was asleep when he heard a big boom. As he woke up, he was stunned to notice a section of the plane’s wing exposed and hydraulic fluid leaking.



“All the passengers were remarkably calm,” he said. Watterson said the crew members handled the situation professionally.



An enquiry on what went wrong is underway.###1949||Pot is profitable, perhaps to barely anyone’s surprise, but the state of Colorado has hotly anticipated figures stemming from the state’s newly implemented marijuana laws.

Sales of retail recreational pot were roughly $14.02 million in January, which in turn, ushered in about $2 million in tax revenue, according to a report from the Colorado Department of Revenue. Colorado is the first state in the U.S. to begin legal sales of recreational pot. Sales in Washington state are expected to start in June or July.

The sale of marijuana for recreational use went into effect on Jan. 1 in Colorado, where Denver’s alternative Westword Magazine included “Bleu Cheese” and “Bubblegum” on its list of the top 10 marijuana strains of 2013.

The total take from marijuana-industry taxes, licenses and fees was $3.5 million for the month. Officials in the Centennial State reportedly said the numbers for January were in line with their expectations. Medical marijuana sales, which have been legal since 2000, brought in $900,000 in taxes last month.

As is the case when tax money rolls in, the powers-that-be will wrangle over its allocation. The first $40 million from the 15% excise tax is slated for school construction. Meanwhile, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper expects the state to rake in $134 million from the cannabis industry in the next fiscal year, and wants a large chunk of the money to go to anti-drug programs for young people.

So, who are the tax-cash folks to watch?

Perfect.

###1952||House Republican leaders have come up with a new health care proposal. And based on a report in the Washington Post, it will look a lot like their old health care proposals—the ones that would have done very little to improve access, reduce financial distress, and contain health care spending. But this new plan would be different in one key respect. Implementing this sort of Republican plan now would probably mean taking away coverage from quite a lot of people who just got it. That’s a pretty big deal.

Of course, they don’t admit that. The main feature of the Republican approach, according to the Post’s Robert Costa, will be cross-state purchasing, expansion of high-risk pools, and malpractice reform. The idea, which Republicans have been talking about for 20 years, would mean that somebody in, say, New York could buy a policy from a carrier in, say, North Dakota. Sounds great, right? We order shoes from far-flung websites and drive across the state line for beer—why not do the same for health insurance? Here’s why: A big reason coverage in places like New York has gotten expensive is local rules designed for protect people from insurance companies’ misbehavior. In New York, carriers must sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing condition, and they must provide a reasonably comprehensive set of benefits.

The Affordable Care Act effectively made those kinds of regulations national. But if the GOP were to get its way, scrapping Obamacare and replacing it with the yet-unpublished plan Costa describes, the insurance industry would likely evolve just like the credit card industry did, with carriers relocating to states with the least regulations. That would be good news for healthy people willing to carry bare-bones coverage, and for people with enough money to pay for a plan, would love this arrangement. But people with preexisting conditions, the ones who were only able to buy coverage thanks to the ACA’s rules, would be back to the bad old days.

Not to worry, Republicans always say—that’s the reason for high-risk pools, which are separate insurance arrangements for people who can’t buy insurance on their own. In theory, high-risk pools may sound like a sensible idea. In practice, they are relatively expensive to run—because, by definition, they don’t have the premiums from healthy people to subsidize the cost of the sick. And they rarely get the money they need from government, because they lack constituencies powerful enough to fight for funding. As a result, high-risk pools almost always end up oversubscribed, leading to long waiting lists. And they typically provide less coverage for more money.###1953||NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world equity markets were mildly negative on Tuesday, the euro edged down and gold rose as traders kept an eye on tensions between Ukraine and Russia and the pace of growth in China.

Credit market investors, meanwhile, were jumping all over Puerto Rico’s $3.5 billion municipal bond sale, which attracted huge interest from many types of funds, including hedge funds and high-net-worth names.

Markets have taken a break from recent volatile trading, and moves in most major stock markets were relatively muted. An index of global stocks .MIWD00000PUS slipped, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was lower as well.

“The market has growing pains here, and rightfully so,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.

“Basically we are at high levels, there are a lot of warnings out there, a lot of signs the market may be topping out.”

The U.S. Treasury market was muted, with the 10-year yield slightly lower to 2.769 percent, rising 3/32 in price. The activity in credit markets was focused on the municipal sector, where the island of Puerto Rico sold $3.5 billion in debt to shore up its struggling finances.

The bonds sold at an 8 percent coupon with a yield of 8.727 percent, levels much less expensive than expected in that market, and several other Puerto Rico bonds were seeing additional buying as non-traditional investors, including hedge funds, took the opportunity to grab this high-yield debt.

“For investors, this is a great return, and we’ve heard there was a lot of high net worth interest in this deal. These are tax-sensitive investors and they were heavily pitched on it,” David Tawil, co-founder of Maglan Capital in New York.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 46.85 points or 0.29 percent, to 16,371.83, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 6.07 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,871.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 11.139 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,323.309.

Economic figures were limited on Tuesday. A sharp fall in wholesale sales surprised investors and led to a buildup in inventories in January, particularly in autos and machinery stocks. Wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent. This is a positive for first-quarter growth, though economists expect the weak sales figure to be reversed.

The euro fell against the dollar and the yen on Tuesday after European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Vitor Constancio told investors that they may have missed the message on policy that rates are set to remain accommodative for some time to come.

Strong trade data from Germany, the region's economic powerhouse, helped the country's DAX .GDAXI index outperform, as it rose 0.9 percent.

“Recent events, especially concerning Russia and Turkey, have made the outlook less certain, and their impact will only be felt in a few months from now,” said Markus Huber, a senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black.

Tensions over Ukraine continued to build on Tuesday. With diplomacy at a standstill, Ukraine’s acting president announced the formation of a volunteer national guard, while ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich insisted he remained the country’s legitimate leader.

Turkish assets have been hit by political scandals and a power struggle between Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and a U.S.-based Muslim cleric.

Some enthusiastically supported Soviet "fraternal assistance" in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.





Would the British anti-war movement do better in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Sadly not. A seminal statement from one of the movement's main leaders Lindsey German is a farrago of half-truths which essentially endorses Putin's worldview. In brief, Russia is not simply the aggressor because NATO has encircled Russia, the European Union just wants to privatise and the neocons want a war because they didn't get their way in Syria. Anyway, you cannot trust those who invaded Iraq. Besides, genuine anti-war movements should tackle western imperialism. Tough luck if you are invaded by an anti-western thug.





It would be laughable if German's movement were just an irrelevant sect but it helps mobilise an odd mixture of insularity and one-sided anti-imperialism, an infantile disorder if ever I saw one, that helped block judicious action against Assad when he used chemical weapons. Its leadership is a toxic influence.





German's analysis completely discounts the idea that peoples in Russia's "near-abroad" want western democracy and markets. They are not mere western pawns and puppets. The European Union may be a sluggish giant but has a bigger capacity to deliver a better life to its members and associates than Putin's Eurasian alternative.





Here's why. At the end of the cold war, Poland and Ukraine were roughly comparable economies. Thanks to endemic corruption, Ukraine has only trebled its wealth while Poland has increased it ten-fold thanks to its reforms.





The shadow of large nations, especially superpowers, and in the Russian case a disgruntled former superpower is always difficult for smaller neighbours. This is made more so by the number of "orphaned" Russians in nearby countries.





A foolish Ukrainian decision to derecognise the Russian language added fuel to the flames but has been vetoed by the interim President. Russian minorities need fair treatment but the historical example of Sudeten Germans in pre-war Czechoslovakia is often invoked by those who fear that Russians will become a fifth column to slice up recognised nation-states and ultimately deliver whole countries as partly or fully-owned Russian property.





No wonder that the Baltic states, each with large Russian minorities, are nervous. They have formally notified their Nato allies about a threat to their security, territorial integrity and independence.





Russia is a distasteful regime but some form of peaceful co-existence based on democratic principles is vital. I detested his actions in Chile in 1973 and he is certainly hated by Kurds who remember the Algiers accord of 1975 but Henry Kissinger has some wise counsel.





He rejects the zero-sum game of "whether Ukraine joins the East or the West" and concludes that, to survive and thrive, Ukraine's geographical position means that it "must not be either side's outpost against the other - it should function as a bridge between them."





The Ukrainians also need internal bridges given what Kissinger calls their "complex history and a polyglot composition." Given it has only been independent for 23 years, comparable to Kurdistan, it is not surprising that "its leaders have not learned the art of compromise."





Self-determination, yes, but wise internal reconciliation and avoiding "institutional hostility toward Russia." Finland has pulled off this trick for a century.





The situation in Ukraine is fluid and Russian intentions are unclear in a so far propaganda rather than shooting war. Western military action is impractical but the emphasis is on diplomacy and smart sanctions if necessary to cause Rouble with a capital T. Russia is more integrated into the world economy than the USSR. Its stock market took a 10% nosedive when Russian forces entered Crimea.





A key factor is Russia's ability to turn off the heating and industry in countries which are supplied by its gas. That America now produces more gas than Russia insulates it and exporting its shale gas would undermine Russia's energy leverage. Europe is currently more vulnerable.





Asked about secure European energy supplies so that this does not end up limiting the west's ability to act against Russia, British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons that Russian actions were "a sharp reminder to everyone in Europe and in this country that it is also an important issue, and that dealing with it will become one of the important foreign policy and security considerations over the next few years." A point for the British Foreign Affairs Committee when it examines British foreign policy towards the Kurdistan Region and its relationship with Turkey as a more reliable energy hub.





Calm resolve and truth-telling rather than idiotic posturing are the vital watchwords to protect Ukraine, curb Russian aggression and avoid a new and damaging cold war.

What an awesome picture!

Not the best landing

Yesterday’s landing wasn’t ideal for the Philae lander. The probe actually bounced a couple of hundred meters on its first landing. This sent the lander away from its planned landing zone.

The harpoons also failed to fire, which could complicate plans to drill. The comet’s gravity of the comet is extremely low. While the Philae lander weighs 100 kilograms on Earth, it weighs just 1 gram on the comet. Any drilling could push the lander off the comet.

And, the lander’s final resting place is in the shadow of a cliff on the comet. This probably means the lander won’t be able to use its solar panels to charge its batteries. Rosetta mission planners are looking at their options for maneuvering the lander.

Even with the hiccups, yesterday’s landing was incredible. It marked the first time a probe has soft landed on a comet. The Philae lander should still be able conduct various observations. It’s initial battery charge is expected to last just under 3 days.

I’ll keep you posted on the latest updates from the Rosetta team as they release them.

BOSTON, March 12 — Hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attack on Herbalife yesterday and said he has evidence the US-based nutrition and weight loss company is breaking direct-selling laws in China, its fastest growing market.

Ackman, who has placed a US$1 billion (RM3.29 billion) short bet against Herbalife, said the company was making recruits pay an entry fee and letting distributors recruit new members, activities he said were illegal in China. He also said the company is disguising its sales to distributors as hourly consulting fees.

Herbalife said it follows local laws. Chinese regulators have yet to comment on the matter but direct sales models have recently come under fire in China, where authorities launched a probe in January into Herbalife’s rival NU Skin Enterprises Inc after state media reported that it brainwashed its members.

In a telephone presentation which lasted more than two hours and drew some 300 listeners, Ackman said the findings were a first step towards bringing his concerns about Herbalife to the attention of Chinese officials.

Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, hired research firm OTG to collect the evidence through interviews with Herbalife distributors in China. He was joined on the conference call by one of his lawyers, David Klafter, who said Herbalife is violating Chinese law.

“My understanding of the facts and law in China is yes, they are violating both civil and criminal law,” Klafter said on the conference call.

Legal experts in China, however, say laws governing direct selling are unclear and enforcement is often lax, which makes any tough regulatory action against Herbalife unlikely.

Some Chinese laws allow direct selling under limited conditions, while others ban so-called pyramid selling, when members make more money recruiting new members than selling the actual product.

“These firms are operating in a regulatory grey area in China, which gives less protection because you’ve got an uncertainty hanging over it,” said Ben Wootliff, Hong Kong-based general manager for global risk consultancy Control Risks.

“The law in China says one thing, if it’s actually enforced is a completely different thing.”

Corey Lindley, chief cfinancial officer at direct sales firm dōTERRA and a former NU Skin executive in China, also said the regulator was unlikely to take strong action against Herbalife any time soon.

“I don’t doubt that because of all of this attention there will be some modest movement of some sort with the regulators just trying to be responsive to all of this, but I don’t think it will be material at all,” Lindley told Reuters.Herbalife said sales in China rose more than 120 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013, the fastest of any region worldwide, contributing about 10 per cent to global sales last year. The company has 200,000 sales representatives in the country and uses a “unique marketing program” to meet Chinese regulations, it said in its latest annual report.

Herbalife has said it remains confident in its business in China and said it is in compliance with local laws.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT

Ackman publically accused Herbalife of running a pyramid scheme in December 2012 when he unveiled his US$1 billion short position in the company’s shares. So far he has lost money on the bet as rivals such as Carl Icahn took the other side.

The company says its business is not a pyramid scheme.

Despite the paper losses, Ackman has said that he has found fresh evidence nearly daily that is convincing him to stick by his original bet. If Herbalife ceased to exist right now he would make a few billion dollars, he said.

But there is no sign yet that Herbalife is near collapse, particularly since no regulator has yet commented publicly about its intentions in spite of heavy lobbying from Ackman.

During the conference call, many participants asked why there are virtually no public stories about people who have lost their life savings on investments in Herbalife.

Ackman said civil rights groups have identified over 1,000 victims and that this firm has found roughly 200 victims. But he said many victims are reluctant to go public because they do not realize they have been cheated or are embarrassed about it. Also “a lot of Latino victims are undocumented and the last thing they will do is complain to the government,” Ackman said.

Fresh media attention, including a front page article in the New York Times on Monday, should help galvanize regulators into reviewing the matter, he said.

SHANGHAI: The Chinese yuan weakened in opening deals on Monday after the central bank doubled the currency's permitted trading band, a move analysts said was a clear signal authorities are ready to allow market forces to play a greater role in the economy.

The spot yuan opened at 6.1500 per dollar, 0.29% away from the official midpoint rate, and it soon slid to 6.1617 per dollar, down 0.19% from Friday's market close.

The central bank set the midpoint at 6.1321 on Monday morning, 0.04% firmer than Friday's fix.

On Saturday, the People's Bank of China doubled the yuan's daily trading range, so that it can now rise or fall 2% from the daily midpoint rate, although in early deals it held with the previous band of +/- 1%.

The first quote in the foreign exchange trading system was initially reported at 6.1573, but that was later revised to 6.1500.

In Hong Kong, the offshore yuan (CNH) was priced at 6.1555 per dollar, 0.1% stronger than the onshore market. The offshore yuan market is not bound by the midpoint rate.

Analysts said the wider trading band was a sign of confidence the central bank had successfully fought off a plague of currency speculators. It was also seen as a signal that regulators believe the economy is stable enough to handle more promised reforms.

The yuan had ended trading on Friday at 6.15 per dollar and one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts, considered the best available proxy for market expectations of the yuan's future value, were pricing the yuan at 6.2120.

UPS AND DOWNS

Authorities have been trying to change the perception the yuan was a certain one-way bet by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other.

The yuan rose 2.9% against the dollar in 2013, outperforming other emerging economy currencies, in a rally that encouraged more one-way bets and led to a dramatic crack down by the central bank.

Indeed, since the beginning of 2014, the central bank had pushed the currency down 1.6% by Friday's close. While not a major move for many currencies, for the yuan it marked a bigger slide than over six months during the Greek debt crisis in 2012.

The currency is not the only uncertainty for investors. Earlier this month, a Chinese company became the first to default on a corporate bond, and worries of slowing economic growth were highlighted by a dramatic 18% fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing. – Reuters



###1960||King, the Swedish company behind the insanely addictive Candy Crush mobile game, is firming up its IPO plans. This morning it released an updated regulatory filing, setting the price range for the offering, which implies a valuation of up to $7.6 billion for the business.

But before jumping to conclusions about what this says about the increasingly frothy-looking valuations among new tech companies, it’s worth pointing out that King is not just profitable; it’s highly profitable. The company made $568 million in real money last year.

By way of comparison, Zynga, the company behind Farmville and Words with Friends, whose share price has struggled since its 2011 IPO, lost $37 million in 2013, while EA Sports, which makes the video games Madden NFL and FIFA, made $98 million in the 12 months prior to March 2013. Among recent high-profile tech IPOs, Twitter and Groupon remain in loss-making mode and LinkedIn eked out a $15-million profit the year before it went public. You have to go back to Facebook (which made $1 billion in 2011) to find a more profitable tech company than King before going public, in nominal dollar terms, according to a list provided to Quartz by Dealogic.

How does King make money? Its addictive games are free to download and use, but it generates revenue by selling “virtual items” to players who are seeking to “enhance their entertainment experience”—for example, if a player gets stuck on a certain level, she can buy boosters to progress or unlock new episodes. Only about 5% of its user base choose this option, but it had more than 400 million monthly active users last month.

King’s profit last year was dramatic increase from the $7.8 million it made in 2012. Which goes some way toward highlighting the real risk facing the company. Candy Crush Saga, released in November of that year, was an enormous hit. But will the company be able to replace it?

As of today, three of the company’s apps (Candy Crush, Farm Heroes Saga and Pet Rescue Saga) are listed in the top-10 high-grossing iOS apps by App Annie, which suggests that it is developing a track record. King argues in its filing that it has an “unparalleled” development process for new games, which involves testing with its most engaged users on its desktop site before new games are rolled out on Facebook and mobile. This, it says, helps the company “develop games faster, at lower risk and at lower cost than our competitor.”

Will the company be able to keep churning out hits? The market will be the ultimate judge.###1961||KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane - an informal “all right, good night” - was spoken after the tracking system, known as “ACARS”, was shut down.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status - had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”

FOCUS ON CREW

The plane vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off its communications systems as the plane flew across the Gulf of Thailand.

Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry,

Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: “We are looking at it.” But it was only one of the possibilities under investigation, he added.

Intensive efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the airplane had not, as of Monday, turned up any information linking anyone to militant groups or anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the aircraft, U.S. and European security sources said.

One source familiar with U.S. inquiries into the disappearance said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the ACARS system.

Many experts and officials say while the jet’s transponder can be switched off by flicking a switch in the cockpit, turning off ACARS may have required someone to open a trap door outside the cockpit, climb down into the plane’s belly and pull a fuse or circuit breaker.

Whoever did so, had to have sophisticated knowledge of the systems on a 777, according to pilots and two current and former U.S. officials close to the investigation.

Malaysian police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practise flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.

Some U.S. officials have expressed frustration at Malaysia’s handling of the investigation. As of Monday morning the Malaysian government still had not invited the FBI to send a team to Kuala Lumpur, two U.S. security officials said.

The FBI, which has extensive experience in investigating airplane crashes, and other U.S. law enforcement agencies have indicated they are eager to send teams to Kuala Lumpur, but will not do so unless formally invited.

VAST SEARCH CORRIDORS

Police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests it could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.

Aviation officials in Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan - as well as Taliban militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan - said they knew nothing about the whereabouts of the plane.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbour to immediately expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin said diplomatic notes had been sent to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force were also searching the southern corridor, he said, and U.S. P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft were being sent to Perth, in Western Australia, to help scour the ocean.

NORTH OR SOUTH?

Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia.

A source familiar with official U.S. assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor.###1962||Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ) recently announced plans to update its mobile app for Apple, Inc.

KHI News Service

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — With the deadline fast approaching to get health coverage this year through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace plans, a final push is on across Kansas, Missouri and other states to get people signed up.

“We have stepped up efforts with our outreach activities. Our navigators have jam-packed their schedules, getting appointments made to get people enrolled,” said Katrina McGivern, communications coordinator for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, one of the Kansas groups given federal grant dollars to help get people enrolled. The association represents Kansas’ various safety net clinics.

KAMU already had billboard advertisements for the Obamacare marketplace up in various parts of the state, but this past weekend also began airing ads in movie theaters. Radio and TV ads also have been airing in the various markets.

The last day of open enrollment is March 31 and most involved with it report that the pace has picked up considerably since the marketplace’s slow start in October 2013. Starting this year, most people who don’t have health insurance but can afford it will face penalties.

‘Starting to realize’

“I think people are starting to realize the deadline is coming. We’re seeing a lot of people who have never had insurance before. They don’t know about co-pays and deductibles. We’re really working with them from square one,” said Misty Kruger of the Shawnee County Health Agency in Topeka.

The agency hired certified navigators and counselors to help people get enrolled and stationed the workers at the public library, a popular community gathering spot, with hours that extend into the evenings and weekends.

Earlier this month in Kansas City, Kan., organizers held a two-day health fair as part of efforts to get the word out.

Salvador Lopez, an Excelsior Springs, Mo. farm worker, was among those who attended the event. He came with his wife and two daughters.

He said he would like health insurance so he could afford diabetes medicine. The coverage also could help his wife, who said she wasn’t feeling well as she had her blood pressure checked.

Lopez said Medicaid already covers his daughters and he was optimistic he would be able to find a plan he could afford through the new marketplace.

“It’s going to help me a lot,” he said.

“I would say the majority of people that we see have no idea what health insurance is, have never had it,” said Pam Seymour, executive director of Shepherd’s Center Central. The nonprofit has two locations in Kansas City, Mo., and has more than a dozen trained workers to help individuals navigate the enrollment process using the federal website.

Surge expected

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported last that 4.2 million people nationwide had purchased exchange plans through the end of February. The Congressional Budget Office had originally projected that 7 million people would enroll in private plans in the first year of the marketplace. Last month it revised that downward to 6 million.

The latest numbers from HHS included about 104,000 people who were signed up in Missouri and Kansas. According to federal estimates, about 1.1 million people in the two states are uninsured and eligible to participate in the exchange. Nationally, the number of uninsured people in 2012 was estimated at about 47 million.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 6 million people will get coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces this year, about 20 percent less than originally projected.

But officials said they are expecting there will be a flurry of enrollments at or near the deadline.

“What we are finding,” HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said with the release of the new enrollment numbers, “is that as more Americans learn just how affordable marketplace insurance can be, more are signing up.”

A department spokeswoman said agency officials were “busy preparing to handle an anticipated surge in enrollment as we approach the end of March.”

HHS officials said they had hired an additional 2,000 workers for the department’s help line – bringing the total to about 14,000 representatives.

Drafters of the Affordable Care Act intended the health insurance marketplaces to operate much like online systems that allow shoppers to compare prices on airline tickets or hotel rooms. The idea behind that was that competition among plans would yield the best deals for consumers.

There also was the assumption that the marketplace could give individuals the clout of being part of a large group similar to people enrolled in a large, employer-based plan.

Resistance

The health-reform law gave states the option of establishing their own marketplace or participating in a federally run exchange.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17 states have their own exchanges. The remaining states are relying on the federal marketplace or created a hybrid federal-state operation.

In many instances, as in Missouri and Kansas, the decision not to establish a state exchange stemmed from conservative Republican and/or voter opposition to Obamacare.

In November 2012, Missouri voters approved a proposition barring the governor or any state agency from helping establish an exchange without legislative or voter approval.

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a conservative Republican who ran for office campaigning against the health reform law, rejected $31.5 million in federal grant money that would have allowed the state to build its own exchange. He also rejected a plan that would have let the state partner with the federal government on a marketplace, opting instead for one run solely by the national government.

Final push

At the Shepherd’s Center in Kansas City, Seymour said, “everybody is ready and up to the challenge of getting these last-minute people enrolled. We are going to pull out all the stops and do whatever we need to do.”

Shepherd’s Center is among the various groups in Missouri and Kansas that are working to inform people that time is running out to buy insurance for 2014 through the marketplace. The next enrollment period starts in November.

Among the initiatives in the Kansas City metro area are Enroll Wyandotte, the coalition that sponsored the recent health fair, and CoverKC, a $700,000 effort bankrolled by the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City.

The St. Louis-based Missouri Foundation for Health has a statewide project called Cover Missouri.

In Kansas, the state insurance department is working with KAMU and other outside organizations to spread the word about the Obamacare health plans.

Various activities

Here are some of the efforts to date and plans for the next couple of weeks:

• Cover Missouri: Has helped enroll about 68,000 Missourians for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, said Ryan Barker, health policy vice president at the Missouri Foundation for Health. That total includes some people who turned out to be eligible for Medicaid. With a multimedia campaign on tap, Barker said he hopes the effort can have 130,000 people enrolled by the end of the month.

• Among KAMU’s efforts is a text messaging campaign. And various KAMU members are running their own ad campaigns and enrollment events, including an “enrollment blitz” scheduled from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Center for Health and Wellness in Wichita. The Wyandotte Health Department will be taking enrollments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the deadline day.

• CoverKC: Since January, workers have knocked on more than 35,000 doors in the urban cores of Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., according to Jessica Hembree, program and policy officer for the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City. Organizers said they hope to have knocked at 70,000 doors by the end of this month, supplemented by mail, telephone and digital marketing.

• Enroll Wyandotte workers aim to have reached about 18,000 residents by the end of the month, said Jerry Jones, executive director of the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County. By the end of the next enrollment period, which ends in mid-January, Jones said the goal is to have 12,000 previously uninsured county residents enrolled in plans through the marketplace.

Enrollment workers said the federal website is working much better than it did last fall.

Field workers said it still can take upwards of two, three or five hours to enroll, if the case is complex, but that they are cautiously optimistic the anticipated surge of sign-ups in the next couple of weeks will not lead to another meltdown.

“We hope the process works better,” said Linda Sheppard, special counsel and director of health care policy and analysis at the Kansas Department of Insurance. “I assume it will. We will see what happens.”###1964||Empty###1965||Empty###1966||Verde Media Group, Inc. logo. (PRNewsFoto/Verde Media Group, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES, March 11, 2014 /Emag.co.uk/ — Verde Media Group Inc. (OTC: VMGI)

As reported by John Ingold of the Denver Post. Colorado collected slightly more than $2 million in taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana in the month of January, according to new figures released by the state Monday.

The numbers are the first official tallies of the historic January sales, themselves a nationwide first.

In January, Colorado collected $1.4 million from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana, plus another $416,690 from the state’s standard 2.9 percent sales tax, according to a news release Monday from the Colorado Department of Revenue. Extrapolating from those figures, recreational marijuana businesses did slightly more than $14 million in retail sales during the month.

Most of the tax revenue came from stores in Denver, and the city reported it collected $616,282 in local sales taxes from recreational marijuana sales in January. In addition, the state will share $128,586 with the city from statewide collections.

Recreational marijuana businesses paid $195,318 in excise tax during January, which will be put toward school construction.

In total, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January.

Both Gov. John Hickenlooper’s budget office and legislative analysts have predicted recreational sales for the first six months of 2014 would top $190 million.

William Veve, President of Verde Media Group, Inc. stated, “Again the business landscape in the legal marijuana market is validated by significant collection of tax revenue.”

DICK'S Sporting Goods###1969||SHANGHAI: China’s central bank doubled the daily trading band for the yuan on Saturday, underscoring efforts to add more volatility and risk to the currency to make it more responsive to market forces.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said the exchange rate will be allowed to rise or fall 2 per cent from a daily midpoint rate it sets each morning. The change is effective from Monday.

The central bank had doubled the trading band to 1pc from 0.5pc in April 2012.

Many market participants have long viewed the yuan as a one-way appreciation bet. Authorities are trying to change that by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other.

“This is a major step towards building more market-oriented exchange rate mechanisms in China, signifying a gradual withdrawal by the central bank from regular intervention in the foreign exchange market,” said Fu Qing, head of foreign exchange trading at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai.

“However, with more volatility in the yuan’s exchange rate created by the reform, Chinese companies will face an uphill task learning how to hedge their currency risks.”

The widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March. Traders suspected that the central bank, working through state banks, pushed the currency down to try to force those speculating on appreciation to unwind their positions.

The idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened.

The central bank guided the yuan to rise 2.9pc against the dollar in 2013, far outperforming other emerging economy currencies and surprising markets, which had not been so bullish.

The rise encouraged capital to flow into the country betting on a steady increase in Chinese interest rates, which made Chinese assets relatively attractive given the weakness of the dollar.

Moving markets

In pushing the yuan lower, the risk was that traders bullish on the yuan would see the weaker levels as a buying opportunity.

However, foreign exchange said that the yuan continued to fall in recent weeks and stay closer to the central bank’s midpoint, even though state-owned banks had stopped intervening, indicating many bulls had been shaken out of the market.

Indeed, a senior money manager for an international investment fund in Shanghai, who spoke off the record because of the sensitivity of relations with regulators, said that the move will likely discourage foreign investors.

“It’s what China needs to do, and the smart money says, OK, this is great, this is two way, we’ll have more money coming in and out. But for the next tier of investor, they see China as very hairy still, not a lot of transparency, and the only news is bad news. They don’t look at this as good news they just look at it as more volatility.”

Analysts said allowing the yuan to trade in a wider range each day and so respond more to market forces would make the currency more attractive internationally.

“China needs to internationalise the yuan and a 1pc fluctuation cannot adequately reflect market demand for and supply of the yuan,” said Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai.

The deadline to enroll for Affordable Care Act health benefits is fast approaching. To get covered through state or federal health exchanges starting this year, most will need to enroll by March 31, 2014.





Maybe you’re on the fence about signing up for ACA insurance. Is it worth it? Will you be able to get the kind of coverage you need? Do medical offices know how to deal with ACA billing? Is HealthCare.gov a glitchy nightmare?

Smart consumers know to read up on any big purchase before buying, so we asked Marketplace listeners to give us their “user reviews” of being insured under the Affordable Care Act. Here’s what some of them had to say:

Jan in El Cajon, CA says she’s been pretty disappointed with what the Affordable Care Act has had to offer her 27-year-old daughter:

Jen in Collingswood, NJ says she’s generally satisfied with the affordability of the ACA plans, and hasn’t run into much trouble using her benefits:

And Cameron in Seattle, WA wishes the ACA offered drastically different coverage options than traditional plans, but she does appreciate how affordable it’s made her medications:

The strong uptick in mortgage applications during the week ended February 28 faded quickly and the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said today that application volume has resumed the downward trajectory that has prevailed since late last fall. According to MBA's Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage volume decreased 2.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from the week before and down 1 percent on an unadjusted basis.

The Refinance Index fell 3 percent week-over-week and refinancing garnered a 57 percent share of mortgage activity, down from 57.7 the previous week. The refinancing share is off 6 percentage points from the level at the beginning of the year and is at the lowest point since April 2011.

Refinance Index vs 30 Yr Fixed

The seasonally adjusted Purchase Index was 1.0 percent lower and the unadjusted Purchase Index was 1.0 percent higher than in the week ended February 28. The unadjusted index was 17 percent below that of the same week in 2013.

Purchase Index vs 30 Yr Fixed

Both contract and effective interest rates rose for all mortgage products during the week. The average contract rate for conventional (loan balances under $417,000) 30-year fixed-rate mortgages (FRM) was 4.52 percent with 0.29 point. The previous week the rate was 4.47 percent with 0.28 point.

The average rate for the jumbo version of the 30-year FRM (balances in excess of $417,000) was 4.41 percent, an increase of 4 basis points from the week before. Points were unchanged at 0.20.

FHA backed 30-year FRM had an average rate of 4.18 percent with 0.21 point. This was an increase from the prior level of 4.13 percent with 0.13 point.

The average contract interest rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 3.53 percent from 3.52 percent. Points increased to 0.28 from 0.18.

Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) had an 8 percent share of mortgage applications which has been essentially unchanged for the last eight weeks. The average contract interest rate for 5/1 ARMs increased to 3.18 percent from 3.09 percent, with points decreasing to 0.36 from 0.38.

MBA's survey covers over 75 percent of all U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, and has been conducted since 1990. Respondents include mortgage bankers, commercial banks and thrifts. Base period and value for all indexes is March 16, 1990=100 and interest rates are based on loans with an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio. Points include the origination fee.###1974||Story recast.

Passenger car sales in Europe increased for the sixth successive month in February, data published by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) revealed Tuesday.

Registrations of new passenger vehicles advanced 8 percent on an annual basis in February to 861,058 units, which the ACEA said was the second lowest unit figure to date for a month of February since it began the series in 2003 with the enlarged EU. In January, sales grew 5.5 percent.

Among the major member countries, sales grew 4.3 percent annually in Germany, and by 8.6 percent in Italy. Spain recorded a 17.8 percent rise in sales, and U.K. posted a 3 percent gain.

Meanwhile, new car registrations in France decreased by 1.4 percent compared to February 2013, the agency said.

During the two months ended February, demand for new passenger cars advanced 6.6 percent annually to around 1.79 million units.

She hasn't highlighted one labor indicator that economists say is sounding inflation alarms: short-term unemployment.



With total joblessness at 6.7 percent in February, still higher than the Fed wants, the rate for those who've been out of work less than 27 weeks was just 4.2 percent.



That's important because Fed policymakers have cited a slack job market and subdued inflation as reasons for keeping short-term interest rates near zero even as the economy picks up.



Consumer prices rose in January at a 1.2 percent annual rate, below the Fed's 2 percent target.



That measure leaves aside those who have been without a job for more than 26 weeks, a group that represented 37 percent of the unemployed in February, compared with 16 percent in the 20 years before the start of the last recession.



The Fed chair suggested that the jobless rate, if anything, may understate how loose the labor market is.



New York Fed economists M. Henry Linder, Richard Peach and Robert Rich also highlighted the importance of short-duration unemployment in a Feb. 12 note, concluding that it has done "a better job" tracking changes in worker compensation than the overall jobless rate.



Based on that measure, full employment – the rate at which inflation remains steady – is about 4.6 percent, the New York Fed economists found.

US Navy Seals boarded and took control of a North Korea-flagged tanker that had loaded crude oil at a port held by rebels in eastern Libya, the Pentagon said Monday.

No one was hurt “when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans,” Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

The operation was approved by President Barack Obama and was conducted just after 0200 GMT Monday “in international waters southeast of Cyprus.”

The Morning Glory “is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government’s National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of Al-Sidra,” the statement read.

The tanker will be “under way soon to a port in Libya” with a team of US sailors aboard.

The Morning Glory, which departed from the eastern Libyan port of Al-Sidra — controlled by rebels seeking autonomy from the authorities in Tripoli — is reported to have loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude.

Pyongyang on Wednesday however denied any responsibility for the tanker.

The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.

Pyongyang had “cancelled and deleted” the ship’s North Korean registry, as it violated its law “on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo”.

“Therefore, the ship has nothing to do” with North Korea, which “has no responsibility whatsoever as regards the ship,” KCNA said.###1978||Empty###1979||Asian CEOs are mostly declining to take a stand on whether they will speak at an investment conference that has become contentious after the suspected death of Saudi journalist, a contrast with U.S. and European counterparts.###1980||Empty###1981||Investing.com - Soft Chinese trade numbers and concerns the Ukraine crisis remains in a standoff that could escalate sent stock prices edging lower on Monday.

At the close of U.S. trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21%, the S&P 500 index fell 0.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.04%.

Weak Chinese trade data sent stocks edging lower on Monday.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling which sent investors ditching stocks for safe-harbor asset venues.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine also helped push stocks south.

Russia remains at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions.

Friday's better-than-expected February jobs report cushioned losses somewhat.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase.

January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals###1985||Gold climbed to a 5-1/2 month high on Wednesday, geopolitical tug-of-war between Russia and Kiev and the West over Crimea and fears of more corporate defaults in China hurt equity markets, increasing the metal's appeal as an insurance against risk.

Spot gold touched its highest since September 20 at $1,362.24 an ounce in earlier trading and was up 0.6% at $1,357.30 an ounce.

US gold futures rose over 1 percent to their 5-1/2 month high of $1,364.10 an ounce, before trading at $1,356.70, up 0.7 percent. "The increase in Asian physical gold demand over the past ten years has been largely due to the huge rise in wealth in that region, so you would think anything that disrupts growth would negatively affect gold demand," Macquarie analyst Matthew Turner said.

"However, until we see that an element of western safe-haven buying because of the knock-on effect it is having on equities and currencies seems to be the dominant driver."

European equities tumbled on worries over global growth, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of main currencies and yields on 10-year U.S. treasuries moved lower at around 2.7 percent.

China's first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world's second-biggest economy, sending London copper prices to their lowest in 44 months. Copper is often put up as collateral for lending.

Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are also weighing on appetite for risk globally on a growing chance of western sanctions over Crimea.

The Group of Seven advanced economies will demand that Russia halt efforts to annex Ukraine's Crimea region in a statement to be issued later on Wednesday.

Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, benefiting from worries about signs of soft economic growth in the United States and China.

The market was now awaiting the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting on March 18-19.

The central bank is most likely to announce another $10 billion cut to its bond-buying stimulus after a series of U.S. economic data showing that growth has been hurt by severe cold weather.

"With the Chinese New Year and the US weather we have been in a bit of a data vacuum and events (like Ukraine, China) have become much more important for gold and those have been on the bullish side," Turner said.

"The following month will be crucial to assess if the US economy is really accelerating and to see what the Fed new outlook is and also how the Chinese demand is going to hold up."

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has fallen due to the jump in prices.

In China, the world's biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20. Platinum was up 0.5% at $1,462.99 an ounce, while palladium fell 0.5% to $760.70 an ounce.###1986||Empty###1987||Empty###1988||Dow Averaging 3% Since 2000

Recent headlines make you believe that the market has been doing exceptional, and it is had a nice run recently, but let's get real. The Dow Jones industrial average (NYSE:DIA) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and NASDAQ (NYSE:QQQ) handily. In addition, if current sentiment has anything to do with it, another major peak may be on the horizon.

Smaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time. My business is one that is constantly monitoring these smaller investors, be it through their responses through social media, traditional media outlets, market based financial articles, television, or through the real time trading reports that we publish for individual stocks, and in keeping my finger on the pulse of these smaller investors I often find contrarian indicators that are actionable from time to time.

This might be one of those times.

The epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again. Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.

To anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener. The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily). Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.

During that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery. Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy. They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind. On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.

Given what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business. The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.###1989||Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HTZ) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 results before markets opened Tuesday. The car rental firm reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.26 on revenues of $2.56 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company reported EPS of $0.33 on revenue of $2.32 billion. Fourth-quarter results compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $0.32 and $2.62 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Hertz reported an EPS of $1.63 on revenues of $10.77 billion, compared with EPS of $1.31 on revenues of $9.02 billion in 2012. The consensus estimate called for EPS $1.70 on revenues of $10.84 billion.

Hertz also announced this morning that it will split the company into two pieces. One will be called Hertz and will comprise its car rental business plus its fleet leasing and management services company Donlen. The second piece will consist of its equipment rental company and will be called HERC. The separation is expected to be achieved as a tax-free spin-off of the equipment rental business to Hertz Global shareholders and the company expects the deal to be completed in early 2015.

It is that spin-off and a new buyback program that drove Hertz Global’s share price higher Tuesday morning, not the paltry results for the quarter or the year. Hertz anticipates net cash of around $2.5 billion as a result of the spin-off, and it will use the cash to pay down debt and support a new $1 billion share repurchase program that the company expects will make most of its purchases following the separation. Hertz said its repurchases could total up to 20% of Hertz’s outstanding shares.

In its comments on the company’s outlook for 2014, revenues are forecast to rise to a range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, and adjusted EPS is forecast in a range of $1.70 to $2.00. Consensus estimates call for EPS of $2.07 on revenues of $11.6 billion.

The company’s CEO said:

In a difficult fourth quarter, we achieved an adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 despite an estimated $0.12 impact of lower than expected pricing and higher expenses related to carrying extra fleet. … We are forecasting Q1 adjusted earnings per share of between $0.07 and $0.09, reflecting the impact, estimated at $0.07 to $0.08 adjusted earnings per share this quarter, of excess U.S. rental car fleet, although we expect fleet levels to be aligned with transaction day growth by the end of this quarter.

Shares were up about 3% in premarket trading Tuesday, at $27.99 in a 52-week range of $19.73 to $29.81.

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 U.S. bankruptcy protection on March 9, a follow up to a similar filing in Japan in late February.

Chapter 15 protection allows for insolvent international companies to benefit from the U.S. court system. It is not exactly clear yet how this will benefit Mt. Gox. The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and other parties of interest involving more than one country.

"Generally, a chapter 15 case is ancillary to a primary proceeding brought in another country, typically the debtor's home country," according to the U.S. Federal Court bankruptcy statute.

Another report has the Mt. Gox system being hacked over the weekend with someone breaking into Mt. Box CEO Mark Karpeles blog. The hackers allegedly pulled a spreadsheet showing that 950,000 Bitcoins were still on the books. Other tidbits include that Mt. Gox had around 1 million customers as of December, although no personal data was released by these tech hounds.

Karpeles has blamed his company's weak security system for the original Bitcoin loss.

This is just the latest in a string of moves surrounding Mt. Gox and the Bitcoin world during the last week.

Bitcoin itself has been the center of controversy since it was created in 2009. Banks and nations have fretted over what it could do to traditional currencies and the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last month is causing further worries over the viability of the currency and the fact that the largest such exchange simply lost or could not find 850,000 Bitcoins priced at the time at around $500 billion.

That is a lot of money, real or digital.

Then, last week the burner was turned on full blast with the revelation by Newsweek that the mysterious man behind Bitcoin was an unassuming, retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto has denied he is the brains behind Bitcoin and that until recently he had never even heard about Bitcoin, but Newsweek is sticking by its story.

Since then Nakamoto has had to lead a life more akin to a Hollywood celebrity, with dozens of reporters chasing his every move.

The urge to discover who truly is the founder of the digital currency is understandable. That person could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and if a face could be connected with the service it could help make it even more successful or at least save it from an early death.

A famous definition of money is that it's an idea backed by confidence, something that is lacking right now. A currency depends on people believing that it is a safe haven and there is little reason for any confidence to be placed on Bitcoin now with the only names associated with Bitcoin either denying their affiliation or trying to explain why their firm went bankrupt or dying.

The most important failure may well be that the entire Bitcoin universe is nothing but a house of cards waiting to topple.

"Mt. Gox is not alone. Forty-five percent of Bitcoin exchanges to date have failed, in most cases with their customers' money. The digital currency industry's track record on fiduciary responsibility is abysmal," wrote Ken Griffith.

The other aspect of this that has to be studied is whether or not a currency, digital or otherwise, can be sustainable without being governed and backed by a national entity.

At Hackingdistributed.com Bitcoin exchanges were compared to the infamous Nigerian prince Internet scams, but these are actually targeted at tech-savvy people.

"Even if the Bitcoin protocol were perfect, and it isn't, our computing infrastructure is not up to the task of handling high-value transactions. The exchanges are built on the latest hyped technologies that have incredibly poor guarantees, and routinely run into technical problems," the site wrote.

Bitcoin has received a lot of recent press attention, both as a speculative investment and as an alternative payment option to fiat currency. The anonymous nature of Bitcoin payments has also caught the attention of tax authorities and other regulators, both in Australia and overseas.

One issue that has received little attention is the GST treatment of Bitcoin transactions that occur within Australia. As discussed below, Bitcoins may not qualify as "money" for GST purposes. As a result, some Bitcoin payments or trades conducted within Australia could attract GST (which is not generally the case for transactions involving fiat currency).

These issues are particularly relevant for GST registered entities that may accept Bitcoin payments. After receiving such payments, an entity will likely either:

use the Bitcoins to make its own payments for goods and services; or exchange the Bitcoins for another currency.

If these transactions occur within Australia, a GST liability could potentially arise.

In a worst case scenario, a GST registered entity that makes a taxable supply in consideration of a Bitcoin payment could be liable for GST twice. Once when the Bitcoins are received as consideration for a taxable supply, and secondly when the Bitcoins are exchanged for Australian currency. This is illustrated through an example in section 8 below.

1 WHAT IS BITCOIN?

Bitcoin is a form of virtual (digital) currency. The currency is transferred online, including for the purposes of payment or trade, via a peer-to-peer payment system. Users store their Bitcoins in a "digital wallet".

Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoins are not issued by any country. One of the key attractions for some investors is the fact that the value of Bitcoins cannot be controlled through traditional monetary policy.

The value of Bitcoins has grown spectacularly. In June 2010, a Bitcoin was worth approximately 8 US cents. The value reached parity with the US dollar in the period between February and April 2011. On 29 November 2013, Bitcoins reached a record price of US$1,124.76.

2 IS BITCOIN "MONEY" FOR GST PURPOSES?

As explained above, Bitcoin is a virtual currency which is intended to be an alternative to fiat currency. However, Bitcoins may not qualify as "money" as that term is defined in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (GST Act).

The term "money" is defined in section 195-1 of the GST Act as follows:

"money includes:

currency (whether of Australia or of any other country); and promissory notes and bills of exchange; and any negotiable instrument used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency (whether of Australia or any other country); postal notes and money orders; and whatever is supplied as payment by way of: credit card or debit card; or crediting or debiting an account; or creation or transfer of a debt." (Emphasis added)

There is a risk that Bitcoins do not meet this definition. In particular, Bitcoins may not qualify as a "currency" or "negotiable instrument" of the type described in paragraphs (a) and (c). This is on the basis that Bitcoins are not issued by the Australian government, or the government of any other country.

Further, Bitcoins are not a promissory note or bill of exchange (i.e. a cheque) for the purposes of paragraph (b). Nor are Bitcoins a postal note or money order for the purposes of paragraph (d).

In relation to paragraph (e) of the definition, the payment of a Bitcoin will not involve a credit or debit card. Nor will it involve the creation or transfer of a debt.

It could perhaps be argued that a Bitcoin payment will involve the "crediting or debiting" of an account for the purposes of paragraph (e)(ii). However, the contrary argument is that such payments will instead involve the transfer of Bitcoins from one "digital wallet" to another, rather than the crediting or debiting of accounts.

3 WHY DOES IT MATTER?

GST applies at the rate of 10% to "taxable supplies". For these purposes, the term "supply" is defined in section 9-10(1) of the GST Act to mean:

"... any form of supply whatsoever".

To ensure that GST does not apply to payments of "money", section 9-10(4) of the GST Act provides:

"However, a supply does not include a supply of money unless the money is provided as consideration for a supply that is a supply of money".

In other words, monetary payments are not treated as a "supply" for GST purposes, except in the context of foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, because payments of "money" are not a "supply", GST is not applicable to such payments.

However, if a Bitcoin is not "money" as defined, the carve out from the definition of "supply" in section 9-10(4) may not apply to Bitcoin transactions. This means that, unlike fiat currency transactions, a Bitcoin transaction could potentially be a taxable supply that attracts GST.

4 WHEN COULD GST APPLY TO A BITCOIN PAYMENT OR TRADE?

Generally speaking, GST only applies to "taxable supplies". An entity that supplies a Bitcoin (through either a payment or trade) could potentially make a taxable supply if each of the following requirements is satisfied:

The supply is made for "consideration"; and

The supply is made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise that the entity carries on; and

The supply is "connected with Australia"; and

The entity is registered for GST, or required to be so registered.

Note that for these purposes, "consideration" can be non-monetary. Therefore, the entity may receive "consideration" if a Bitcoin payment is made in exchange for goods, services or other things.

As one of the requirements is that the entity must make the supply in the course of carrying on its enterprise, a GST liability may not arise for individuals who use Bitcoins as a payment method in a private and domestic capacity.

However, if an individual carries on an enterprise that involves trading of Bitcoins then, depending on whether the individual exceeds the GST registration threshold of A$75,000, the individual may need to register for GST and could potentially be liable for GST on the Bitcoin trades.

5 EXAMPLE OF GST APPLYING TO A BITCOIN PAYMENT

White Co is a GST registered company based in Australia. It has decided to purchase an apartment in Pyrmont from Rebecca for $550,000. The apartment will be converted to an office and has been acquired as a part of White Co's business enterprise. Rebecca is not GST registered and the apartment she is selling was used as her principal place of residence.

Rebecca has agreed that she will accept either $550,000 in Australian currency, or the equivalent value in Bitcoins, in exchange for the apartment. As the supply of the apartment is made by Rebecca in a private capacity, no GST liability will arise for her on the sale (regardless of whether she is paid in Australian currency or Bitcoins).

If White Co paid for the apartment using Australian currency, which is "money" as defined in the GST Act, the payment would not be treated as a supply. Therefore, White Co would not be liable for GST in respect of the payment.

However, if White Co instead paid for the apartment using Bitcoins (which may not qualify as "money" as defined), White Co may be treated as making a taxable supply of the Bitcoins which triggers a GST liability. The consideration for the supply of the Bitcoins is the $550,000 apartment transferred by Rebecca, triggering a GST liability of $50,000 for White Co.

In this example, White Co's GST liability would not be offset by any input tax credit (GST credit). White Co would need to have the funds available to the pay the $50,000 liability in Australian dollars.

6 ACCEPTANCE OF BITCOIN PAYMENTS

If a GST registered entity accepts Bitcoins as payment for a taxable supply, this may give rise to some practical issues that do not arise where Australian currency is accepted in payment. Specifically:

The entity will need to determine the market value of the Bitcoins that have been received so that it can calculate the amount of GST that is payable on the taxable supply.

If a "tax invoice" is issued, the entity will need to show the amount of GST payable on the taxable supply in Australian dollars on the tax invoice. This is notwithstanding that the total invoice amount may be paid in Bitcoins.

The entity will need to have Australian dollars available to pay the GST on its taxable supplies. The ATO will not accept Bitcoins as payment.

While these issues should generally be manageable, they are additional practical considerations for entities that intended to accept Bitcoin payments. These same issues do not arise for payments that are received in Australian dollars.

7 COULD GST APPLY IF A BITCOIN IS EXCHANGED FOR AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY IN AUSTRALIA?

Foreign exchange transactions which occur within Australia are treated as a "financial supply". Financial supplies are "input taxed" and not subject to GST.

For these purposes, Item 9 in Regulation 40-9.05(3) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Regulations 1999 (GST Regulations) provides that a supply will be an input taxed financial supply if it involves an interest in:

"Australian currency, the currency of a foreign country, or an agreement to buy or sell currency of either kind".

It is unlikely that this Regulation could apply to an exchange transaction involving Bitcoins, as a Bitcoin is neither "Australian currency" nor "currency of a foreign country". Rather, it is a virtual currency that is not associated with any country. Therefore, such transactions could involve taxable supplies, where the requirements outlined in section 4 above are satisfied.

Note that as discussed in section 9 below, GST may not apply if the Bitcoins are supplied to a nonresident counter party that is not in Australia.

8 EXAMPLE OF GST APPLYING TWICE WHERE BITCOINS ARE ACCEPTED AS PAYMENT

White Co has sold equipment worth $11,000 (including GST of $1,000) to an Australian customer. White Co has agreed to accept an equivalent amount of Bitcoins instead of Australian currency in payment for the equipment.

White Co will have a GST liability of $1,000 on the sale of the equipment, notwithstanding that it has received Bitcoins instead of Australian currency.

Following the sale, White Co decides the convert the $11,000 worth of Bitcoins that it has received to Australian currency. White Co sells the Bitcoins to a purchaser within Australia for $11,000. The sale of the Bitcoins may be treated as a taxable supply, triggering a second $1,000 GST liability for White Co.

Had White Co accepted Australian currency at first instance, there would not have been any need to convert the Bitcoins and the second potential GST liability would not have arisen.

9 WOULD GST APPLY IF A BITCOIN IS SUPPLIED TO SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF AUSTRALIA?

If a Bitcoin is supplied (as either a payment or trade) to an entity that is outside of Australia, that supply may be GST-free (and not subject to GST) under the export exemption provisions in section 38-190(1) of the GST Act.

Section 9-5 of the GST Act provides that where a supply is both GST-free and taxable, the GST-free treatment will prevail.

10 COULD GST APPLY TO BITCOIN ATM SERVICES?

There have been recent press reports regarding proposals by some companies to introduce Bitcoin ATMs into Australia.

Generally speaking, ATM services are treated as a financial supply and input taxed under Regulation 40-5.09(4A) of the GST Regulations. However, it is unclear whether those provisions may only apply to ATM services provided in respect of accounts that are maintained in relation to "money" (as defined in the GST Act).

If the provisions do not apply, services provided via Bitcoin ATMs located in Australia could be taxable supplies and subject to GST.

11 CAUTION REQUIRED FOR BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS

For the reasons outlined above, the GST treatment of Bitcoin transactions that occur within Australia should be considered carefully. This is particularly the case for GST registered businesses that may be considering accepting Bitcoins in payment for goods or services, and for entities that engage in significant Bitcoin trading activities.

The Chinese central bank's decision to relax its grip on the yuan has been welcomed as a sign of financial liberalization, but it is aggravating concerns among foreign executives and investors about their exposure to China in the near term.

The doubling of the trading band from Monday points to much greater downside risk in a currency that many investors have treated as a one-way appreciation bet for years, even when the yuan's daily trading range was expanded in the past.

But it adds to a combination of factors that had already made these investors cautious. The central bank had engineered a slide in the yuan's value, adding to jitters in a market already anxious over the country's first default on a domestic bond, and signs of slowing economic growth, highlighted by a dramatic 18 percent fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing.

"The foreign investors who we spoke with before this announcement were already becoming cautious," said Brian Ingram, chief investment officer at Ping An Russell Investment Management in Shanghai. "I think this announcement adds to the short-term or near-term bear case for those investors."

The central bank said that from Monday it would allow the exchange rate to rise or fall by 2 percent from the official guidance rate on any given day. Previously the range had been 1 percent.

The move was welcomed by economists as a sign that Beijing is following through on a promise to allow market forces to play a greater role in the economy.

In theory it means the central bank will meddle less in the market, although foreign exchange traders suspect the regulator, through state-owned banks, deliberately pushed the yuan down this year to shake out those speculating on one-way appreciation of the currency.

Still, the risk of greater volatility implicit in a wider trading band will make already nervous investors more cautious.

Companies that sign billions of dollars worth of trade contracts with Chinese firms, and foreign investors considering whether to hedge their China bets, may well reduce their level of exposure.

"From some Western investors' perspective, China is just bad, so anything that looks funny or sounds squirrely means volatility and less interest," said a senior money manager for an international investment fund in Shanghai, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

"In general the large institutions, the pension funds, they just see this as bad news."

The yuan rose 2.9 percent against the dollar in 2013, outperforming other emerging economy currencies, in a rally that encouraged more one-way bets and led to a dramatic crack down by the central bank.

Uncertain

These various risk factors have left analysts increasingly divided over the direction of the yuan this year. In past years, as the economy boomed and trade surpluses flooded into the country's coffers, it was a question of choosing how far the currency would rise.

Now forecasters are less certain and wonder if the government had other motives behind Saturday's announcement.

"We have all been surprised at the sell-off of the yuan versus the dollar," said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.

"It was down near 6 and now above 6.10. We are scratching our heads and wondering if the beginning of a trend reversal is being orchestrated by the government ... Everyone is afraid of a slowdown in the Chinese economy."

Lars Christensen, chief emerging market analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, also questioned the timing of the move and wondered if the slowdown in economic growth is the real concern for authorities.

"The big question is why they are doing this and to what extent they are being forced to do it, if outflows have been more than were thought. So is it a defensive move or a pre-emptive move that opens the door for monetary easing?"

While the uncertainty lasts, it is a victory for the central bank, which has struggled for years to get those in the currency market to shake off the belief that the yuan can only rise.

Reflecting an increasing divergence of views, Li Heng, economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing, predicts the yuan will stay flat or weaken in 2014 to end the year between 6.15 and 6.20 per dollar.

The yuan ended trading on Friday at 6.15 per dollar and is down 1.6 percent so far this year, its sharpest fall since during the Greek debt crisis in 2012.

One-year non-deliverable forwards contracts, considered the best available proxy for market expectations of the yuan's future value, last priced the yuan at 6.2120 per dollar even before the band was widened.

But HSBC economists believe the recent decline in the yuan, which is also known as the renminbi (RMB), is not sustainable given China's durable attraction for investors as the big growth story compared with other economies, and predicted it will still go on to end the year at less than 6 per dollar.

"We still expect RMB appreciation to 5.98 versus the USD by the end of 2014, but the path will be volatile," they wrote in a client note.

In a sign that the central bank has succeeded in adding uncertainty to the direction of the yuan, dealers said sentiment has remained subdued even though intervention by state owned banks has wound down in the last week or so.

During the Greek crisis, the sliding yuan deterred many corporates from adopting the currency for use in trade, and the offshore yuan market saw its expansion stall, implying that much of the corporate enthusiasm for using the unit was dependent on appreciation expectations.

Ping An's Ingram said Chinese markets are "going to stay very ugly for a bit" but that will lead to investment opportunities.

"Once the market can get past all these scares about what is happening with defaults, all these scares about to what extent growth is going to slow down, there is actually good investment opportunity here," he said, citing a cheaper renminbi and attractive bond yields.

"We are waiting for that opportunity to jump back in."###1999||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below. These symbols will be available during your session for use on applicable pages. Update

Speaking at the closing press conference of the National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday, China's No.2 leader said he was confident in the health of the country's economy, and that bearish talk of a 'hard landing' had consistently been proven wrong.

Mr Li conceded the "downward pressure" on the economy was the toughest challenge he faced last year, and said the challenge may prove even harder this time round as China continues to push through a painstaking restructuring of its economy.

"There is no denying we may encounter a more complex situation this year," he said, raising the difficult balancing act of maintaining jobs growth, keeping inflation in check, alleviating environmental problems, all while improving the efficiency and quality of China's economic growth.

"We need to strike a proper balance among all these goals and objectives."###2002||Empty###2003||Shanghai: China is planning a major expansion of its transport networks and urban infrastructure as it seeks to increase migration from rural to urban areas, lifting incomes and demand to drive continued economic growth.

The 2014-20 urbanisation plan released on Sunday aims to boost domestic consumption by increasing the proportion of urban residents among China`s population of almost 1.4 billion to 60 percent by 2020, up from 53.7 percent now.

Among the biggest obstacles to the planned relocation of several hundred million rural residents is the huge infrastructure development needed to accommodate the new wave of city dwellers as well as reform of the country`s "hukou" registration system.

This complex system of residency registration is a major sticking point because it controls the benefits that residents can enjoy. The system denies basic services to those who relocate without permission, fanning social unrest.

China`s leaders, however, will make it easier for rural migrants to obtain residency status in smaller cities, with the intention of helping to unlock the nation`s huge potential domestic demand. Urban salaries are higher than rural incomes, meaning that a larger city-based population should have greater spending power.

"Domestic demand is the fundamental impetus for China`s development, and the greatest potential for expanding domestic demand lies in urbanisation," state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the plan from China`s State Council, which added detail to previous announcements about the urbanisation drive.

RAIL LINKS

The plan will create "huge" demand for investment in public infrastructure, with authorities seeking a substantial increase in social housing as well as the development of expanded urban underground transport networks by 2020.

Every city with more than 200,000 residents will be covered by standard railways by 2020, the plan said, with high-speed services connecting cities with more than 500,000 residents. The civil aviation network, meanwhile, will cover about 90 percent of the population.

Authorities are also targeting environmentally friendly growth, a serious issue for a nation that has been bogged down in pollution issues including toxic levels of smog, polluted waterways and so-called "cancer villages".

These villages, hit by high levels of water, air and soil pollution, are a symptom of China`s many years of rampant economic growth, when environmental issues took a back seat to financial rewards.

The 2014-20 urbanisation plan said it will improve water safety and air quality.

"Green production and green consumption will become the mainstream of city economic life. The amount of power and water-saving products, recycled goods and green construction will be raised substantially," the report said.

China will also increase the number of small and mid-sized cities, boosting less-developed regions in the west of the country and improving services to meet demand from the influx of rural residents, the plan said.###2004||Gold posted a modest gain on Tuesday as investors sought a safe haven amid growing concerns about China’s economic growth and the standoff between Russia and the West over Ukraine.

On Monday, China posted its first monthly trade deficit in two years. In February, Chinese exports dropped 18.1% year-over-year, largely due to a plunge in steel shipments to North America and Europe. The report renewed fears over the strength of the Chinese economy. In Ukraine, no diplomatic resolution of the Russian occupation of Crimea appeared in sight as Russian forces continue to consolidate their control of the peninsula.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Growth in China's retail sales slowed to 11.8 percent, or 4.23 trillion yuan (690 billion U.S. dollars), year on year in the first two months of the year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday.

The growth rate in December stood at 12.3 percent.

Urban consumption in the first two months amounted to 3.65 trillion yuan, up 11.7 percent year on year. Rural residents spent 581.4 billion yuan, up 12.8 percent, the NBS data showed.

The catering sector reported 441.4 billion yuan in revenues, up 9.6 percent year on year, while retail sales of consumer goods stood at 3.8 trillion yuan, up 12.1 percent.

After being adjusted for inflation, retail sales went up 10.8 percent in the first two months.###2006||Parents of the students who were directly involved were notified personally, and all other parents of high school students were contacted using an automated One Call Now system with a recorded message.###2007||The Bank of England's Governor has said that there is room for British business to hire more people as the country continues its economic recovery.

Mark Carney, speaking to Treasury Committee in the House of Commons, said he believed there is "some spare capacity in firms as well as in the UK's labour market", but stressed others on the central bank's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had varying opinions.

Carney's comments come after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) recently revealed that the country's unemployment rate slightly rose to 7.2% in the three months to December 2013.

"What we've learnt over the course of the last seven months since we put in place the first phase of forward guidance, or so what I've learnt, is that that equilibrium rate of unemployment has gone down," Carney said.

He added: "It's lower than we would have thought in August and in August we estimated as a committee that it was about 6.5%.

"I personally would mark it around 6% now, potentially slightly lower.

"So we have a 7.2% unemployment rate a year at present, relative to a medium-term equilibrium level of about 6%."

Toyota Motor Corp. spokesman Naoki Sumino said some workers were disrupting production. There have been no injuries or damage at the plants.

The lockout came Monday following negotiations that began in April last year, and arbitration talks that failed earlier this year.

The two plants in Bangalore produce 310,000 vehicles a year, including the Innova van, Fortuner sport-utility vehicle, Corolla subcompact and Etios models.
