3191||Republican Tennessee Rep. Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

We've tweaked the language at the beginning of this post to reflect this development.

The trade-in incentive launches March 26, and will roll-out at 3,100 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores across America in conjunction with CE Exchange.

Later this year, pre-owned games will be placed on shelves, so the games you trade-in for store credit next week won’t be available for re-sell immediately.

The retailer has posted a video tutorial showing you how to go about trading your unwanted games in, and we’ve posted it below.

Pre-owned games are already available through the firm’s website.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent, or 5.99 points, to 2,029.66. Turnover was 46 billion yuan (US$7.5 billion) by midday.

Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd led the gains of distilleries, rising 5.3 percent to 175.31 yuan, after the Shanghai Securities News reported that the state-owned liquor maker plans to list Guizhou Xijiu, a unit of its portfolio, in Hong Kong later this year.

Most homebuilders were sluggish after the National Bureau of Statistics showed that 57 of the 70 major cities in China recorded rises in new home prices, down from 62 in January.

Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 6.93 yuan. Gemdale Corporation shed 1.1 percent to 6.27 yuan. Deluxe Family Co Ltd slipped 2.2 percent to 4.07 yuan.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###3201||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3205||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Source: Eastman Chemical Company Eastman Chemical Company Named as a 2014 World's Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere(R) Institute Eastman reaffirms its commitment to honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior

Kingsport, Tenn., USA, Mar 21, 2014 - (ACN Newswire) - Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) announced today that it has been recognized by the Ethisphere(R) Institute as a 2014 World's Most Ethical Company(R) for its efforts to continually raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior.



"Eastman is dedicated to conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest legal and ethical standards," stated David Golden, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary for Eastman. "For nearly 100 years, business ethics have been top priority for Eastman. Ethics are critical to success because they build trust and confidence in our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we work and live. Receiving this prestigious recognition further reinforces the commitment to honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior inherent in the Eastman culture."



Eastman has a number of policies and initiatives in place that allow its team members to cultivate a culture of the highest integrity and ethical standards. The company has an Office of Global Business Conduct, led by Eastman's Chief Legal Officer, which establishes the Code of Business Conduct. Globally, dedicated Eastman professionals are employed to support the company and its partners in doing business in the most ethical and compliant manner. The Code of Business Conduct outlines the laws, principles and guidelines all employees follow regarding honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior.



The company also has a third party Code of Conduct, called 'Doing Business with Eastman', which outlines the high ethical standards that Eastman expects of its business partners. Annual training on the Code of Business Conduct is required for all employees. Additionally, the 24-hour available Business Conduct Helpline provides an anonymous means for employees and business partners to report suspected violations.



World's Most Ethical Company honorees understand the correlation between ethics, reputation and daily interactions with their brand and that the award belongs as much to their associates as it does to them. Eastman is one of only three companies in the global chemical industry honored this year.



"The entire community of World's Most Ethical Companies believe that customers, employees, investors and regulators place a high premium on trust and that ethics and good governance are key in earning it," said Ethisphere's Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Erblich. "Eastman joins an exclusive community committed to driving performance through leading business practices. We congratulate everyone at Eastman for this extraordinary achievement."



The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient(TM) framework. The Ethics Quotient framework has been developed over years of effort to provide a means to assess an organization's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. The Ethics Quotient framework and methodology was determined, vetted and refined by the expert advice and insights gleaned from Ethisphere's network of thought leaders and from the World's Most Ethical Company Methodology Advisory Panel.



Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

Today's Budget will include at least one money-making scheme for Wales, with the Royal Mint at Llantrisant ready to roll out the replacement for the £1 coin.

The new £1 will have the same 12-sided shape of the “threepenny piece” which vanished with decimalisation in 1971.

According to the Royal Mint, about 3% of all £1 coins (or 45 million) are now forgeries. The present £1 has been in circulation for more than three decades – much longer than the lifetime of a typical coin – and is prey to counterfeiters.

The new “bi-metallic” two-colour coin should be introduced in 2017 and will be roughly the same size as the £1 coin, and the Royal Mint – which developed the technology at its South Wales base – is confident it will be “the most secure coin in the world”.###3208||Before a crowd of supporters at a campaign rally on Thursday afternoon in the city of Bursa—about a two-hour ferry ride from Istanbul—Turkey’s Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, vowed to ban Twitter. The threat came in the middle of a particularly fiery speech, even for Erdoğan, who wields a nuclear arsenal of angry declarations and allegations. “We now have a court order,” he said. “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic.”

Just before midnight, as though yielding directly to the force of Erdoğan’s fury, Turkey became one of only two countries in the world to block Twitter entirely. (The other is China.) Four separate court orders prevent Turkish Internet service providers from connecting to Twitter’s servers, making it impossible to access the service.

Twitter has been a target of Erdoğan’s increasing anger since May of 2013, when the social-media platform was used to help organize the anti-government protests that spread from Istanbul’s Gezi Park throughout Turkey. Back then, he called Twitter a “scourge.” Even before Gezi, individuals were occasionally prosecuted for tweets that were considered blasphemous or were found to “incite hatred.” In February, the Azeri journalist Mahir Zeynalov was deported from Turkey for two tweets. When a controversial investigation into government corruption, launched in December, was effectively blocked in the courts, information described as “suppressed evidence” began to be leaked online by opponents of Erdoğan, often using Twitter. One particularly explosive recording purports to feature an anxious conversation between Erdoğan and his son Bilal about hiding millions of dollars from investigators.

A pamphlet called “Everybody Should Know These Facts,” recently distributed throughout Istanbul by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.), warns readers to beware of false news that is spread on Twitter—where, Erdoğan alleged last month, his government was being assailed by a “robot lobby.” It’s obvious that the Prime Minister views Twitter as a serious threat to his leadership. It’s harder to know why he thinks blocking it is a good move.

This morning, when I reached Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Istanbul’s Bilgi University and an expert in cyberlaw, he was at a conference in Ankara on Internet freedom. “Blocking access to Twitter is the worst kind of censorship one can imagine,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Absence of these social media platforms will be seen as a significant democratic deficit in Turkey. Certainly, it casts a dark shadow over Turkey’s democratization process and potential EU membership.” What it does not do, unfortunately for Erdoğan, is prevent people from using Twitter.

According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, fourteen per cent of Turkey’s eighty million people use Twitter—a relatively high figure for a country where only forty-five per cent of the population uses the Internet. Shortly after news outlets reported the ban, articles about how to circumvent it began to circulate widely, and the hashtags #twitterisblockedinturkey and #turkeyblockedtwitter were among Twitter’s trending keywords worldwide. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, retweeted the company’s advice—in Turkish—about how to post tweets using S.M.S., while other Turks on Twitter sang the praises of their V.P.N. services, which bypass local Internet providers. According to a company that tracks Twitter use in Turkey, more than half a million tweets were posted in the first ten hours after the ban took effect, roughly in line with normal daily activity. Even members of the A.K.P. appeared to breach the ban, including Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç, who announced his campaign schedule on Twitter.

Among ordinary users, anger mixed with mockery. Many people posted a drawing of Erdoğan spraying a black cloud of insecticide at the blue bird that is Twitter’s logo. Another popular illustration turned the white crescent on the Turkish flag into a Pac-Man about to eat the bird. A photo of Erdoğan on the phone has the Prime Minister asking the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, “I’m blocking Twitter. Then what?” Representatives from the European Union and the United States have already condemned the ban, as have human-rights groups—but Erdoğan claims not to care about the international community.

Among Erdoğan’s critics and among journalists in Turkey, the ban only serves to demonstrate how tone-deaf the A.K.P. has become in its zeal for message control. The move against Twitter looks desperate and, given how accessible the service remains, futile—the sort of clumsy measure that authoritarian leaders often take as they witness their power draining away. (The last time I woke up to news of Twitter being blocked was three years ago, in Cairo, when it was ordered by Hosni Mubarak.) But the ban also highlights a disturbing trend in Erdoğan’s attitude toward the opposition, and signals that the authoritarian tendencies that surfaced during last year’s Gezi protests are only growing stronger. Local elections are set to be held in nine days, and the atmosphere is tense.

Yesterday, before the ban went into effect, the journalist and author Mustafa Akyol wrote about the A.K.P.’s reëlection campaign for the news site Al-Monitor. In the article, called “Erdoğan’s Great Patriotic War,” Akyol dissects a campaign video that in grand, dramatic strokes implies that there are forces inside Turkey that are intent on dismantling the nation, and only Erdoğan, along with the unwavering support of Turkish citizens, can stop them. “No words are spoken other than Erdoğan’s excerpt from the national anthem,” Akyol says, “but for all Turks who see it, the message is all too obvious: Erdoğan’s political opponents are not only attacking him, they are attacking the nation itself. Turkish patriots must unite against these most wicked of enemies.”

In February, the Turkish parliament passed a bill, which President Abdullah Gül later signed into law, that gave the government broad control over the Internet, including the ability to block sites without a court order and to collect and retain user histories. When the law was first passed, I interviewed Geoffrey King and Nina Ognianova, of the Committee to Protect Journalists. They were both dismayed by the new law, and, though Twitter was still unblocked, it was already clear that online speech was not entirely free. At that point, China was the only country still blocking Twitter, and neither King nor Ognianova anticipated a complete ban in Turkey—which, after all, still hoped to join the E.U. “Losing a platform like Twitter, even if it’s replaced by another, is a disaster for both regular citizens and professional journalists,” King told me. In a separate conversation, Ognianova was equally direct. “In the past few years, Turkey has gone from a country that’s been considered a regional hope to a country that’s now considered a regional concern,” she said. “That’s characterized by a shrinking space for freedom of expression.”

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.###3211||ATLANTA (AP) — Federal and state officials have been working for nearly two years to shore up the nation's election infrastructure from cyberattacks by...###3212||Technology employed to protect banknotes from counterfeiters has been introduced into a prototype £1 coin by The Royal Mint.

Integrated Secure Identification Systems (iSIS) is the result of R&D from engineers at The Royal Mint that has so far seen £2m of investment into a coin that will have ‘covert’ security embedded into it for the first time.

Launched in May 2013, iSIS is said to give coins three tiers of ‘banknote-strength security’ that can be authenticated through high-speed automated detection. A survey undertaken in November 2013 found that the rate of counterfeit UK £1 coins in circulation at the time had risen from 2.74 per cent to 3.04 per cent, and the Royal Mint add that a new level of detection in vending machines will also be possible too, thereby removing this method of introducing fake coins.

Expected to be introduced in 2017, the new 12-sided coin will be constructed from two different – but as yet unspecified – coloured metals.

According to Royal Mint, iSIS is expected to reduce costs by replacing expensive clad and homogeneous coins with a more affordable full-plated option rather than a surface coating that is prone to wear over time.

In a statement Adam Lawrence, chief executive of The Royal Mint said: ‘We are already known as the world’s leading export mint, but iSIS confirms our place as leaders within our industry, as we continue to expand the boundaries of minting technology.’

A public consultation will be held over the summer before a final decision is made on the precise specification of the new coin.###3213||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###3214||Empty###3215||Why did this happen?

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: " After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit".

The reverse side of a 12-sided three-pence piece which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971 (PA/HM Treasury)

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: " The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

The Treasury believes that around three per cent - amounting to a total of £45m - of pound coins are fake.

To combat the problem a new 12-sided pound coin will be introduced in 2017.

But until then how can you tell if your pound coins are genuine or fake?

Key signs of a fake are:

- Quality. A genuine coin will have sharp, clearly defined markings of the Queen's head or the picture on the flip side.

- Alignment. The Queen's head and the picture on the flip side should line up, as in the image above. They are often askew on fake coins.

- Design. The design on the reverse of the coin corresponds with a specific year of production. A list of the correct designs can be found here

- Colour. If the colour does not match the usual colour of most pound coins it is likely to be fake, or if on old coin shows no sign of ageing it could be fake.

- Milled edge. Uneven depth in the lettering or spacing is a sign of a fake.###3218||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo last month, and raised doubts about the viability of the virtual currency, has announced stumbling upon a stash of about 200,000 bitcoins kept in offline wallets.

The Tokyo-based company has not yet explained how the huge amount of bitcoins, currently valued at about $120 million had moved to “old format” wallets. The company said only that the bitcoins were found in an old-format wallet which it thought no longer held any bitcoins. With the discovery, the number of bitcoins missing from the exchange comes down from 850,000 to 650,000.

Mt. Gox was not supervised by local regulations in Japan and thus user’s deposits were uninsured by government entities. Following news of the controversy, in U.S., District Judge Gary Feinerman had frozen the assets belonging to Mt. Gox, but later loosened his restraint on March 11 to allow movement of small amounts of the digital crypto-currency.

The records and offline wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings, the company said in a statement posted on its website. It said the bitcoins rediscovered now had been moved to its offline wallets. Though it did not specify the nature of the offline wallets, normally USB sticks and paper documents are used as such.

The statement mentioned further, “For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC which were at first on the 7th moved to online wallets, were moved between the 14th and 15th to offline wallets. These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels.”

When the company filed for bankruptcy protection it said that nearly all of its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, and said the most likely reason was theft. Out of the 850,000 bitcoins, about 750,000 belonged to those who used the exchange.

Zurich, Switzerland, March 21, 2014 - ABB, the power and automation technology group, has been named by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent research center promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, to its 2014 list of the world's most ethical companies. This is the second consecutive year that ABB has been recognized by the Institute, which acknowledges organizations that continue to raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior. According to Ethisphere, honorees understand the correlation between ethics, reputation and daily interactions with their brand."We are once again very pleased with the progress we have made in ethical leadership in our business processes and our organization," said ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. "Ethical leadership is key to ABB's long-term success and we are therefore very proud that Ethisphere recognizes this." "We want to integrate ethical leadership deep into our organization. Our integrity program relies on local management to lead by example," Diane de Saint Victor, ABB General Counsel and member of the Executive Committee, added. "All local managers have to take responsibility for ethical leadership and corporate behavior to ensure that the ethics message comes from the same person that sets the business targets." The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based on the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient framework, which has been developed over years to provide a means to assess an organization's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. The Ethics Quotient framework and methodology was determined, vetted and refined by the expert advice and insights gleaned from Ethisphere's network of thought leaders and from the World's Most EthicalCompany Methodology Advisory Panel . "The entire community of the World's Most Ethical Companies believe that customers, employees, investors and regulators place a high premium on trust and that ethics and good governance are key in earning it," said Ethisphere's Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Erblich. "ABB joins an exclusive community committed to driving performance through leading business practices. We congratulate everyone at ABB for this extraordinary achievement." Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

WASHINGTON � Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said yesterday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state � Iowa � where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that�s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month.

Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrate that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That�s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more-positive view of the nation�s job market than the employer survey did.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state�s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next-highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.

North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil- and gas-drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.

Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn�t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.

The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.

California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.###3223||Empty###3224||Empty###3225||Why did this happen?

Live Better” and the new online shopping tool will allow customers to do just that by seeing the competitors price before they purchase an item online.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt.

Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. For example, in Atlanta, Walmart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General.

Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. They can redeem in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Shoppers compare competitor prices so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Walmart has a long history of undercutting competitors prices, this move could not only change the way people shop, but also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart said it wants to see how competitors and customers respond to the program, but it doesn’t have any plans to add online stores to the test.

Walmart built its business on offering lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Walmart’s “every day low price” model is under attack from dollar stores and grocery stores like Kroger in addition to the Amazons of the world. On top of that, the retailer’s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

The companies U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

The fresh idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Walmart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. Last month, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don’t feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

The company declined to say when the program could be expanded nationally.

The rouble-denominated MICEX was down 3 percent while the dollar-denominated RTS index had fallen 3.6 percent.

Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from

ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor’s. They’ve both downgraded the outlook for Russia’s sovereign debt from “stable” to “negative.”

Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister had said that he did not see any immediate impact from sanctions on Russia’s financial sector or creditworthiness.

On Friday, Visa and Mastercard stopped authorising point-of-sale transactions for Bank Rossiya, which is on the list of targeted economic sanctions leaving many cardholders in shops with declined purchases.

The sanctions against Bank Rossiya has raised fears that similar actions could be taken against other Russian banks, echoing US measures against Iran or Syria.###3229||Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg Yves Mersch warned that failing to reach a deal on the last element of the banking union would be 'close to suicide'

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

[R]eports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###3230||You know how it is: you’re in a tight spot financially and in one last ditch effort to find some petty cash you go to scrape around for coins in an old purse or coat pocket—and come up with $100 million or so. No? That’s pretty much the latest in the saga of embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

After having announced the alleged theft of 744,408 bitcoins—about $350 million at the time—in late February, and filed for bankruptcy in Japan, the exchange has apparently stumbled upon a forgotten stash of 199,999.99 BTC. That’s around $116 million in old-school money.

The news was announced in a filing posted on the company's site dated 20 March. The report explained Mt. Gox had happened upon the trove of bitcoins in an old wallet it thought was empty. “MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain old format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins. Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched,” the filing reads.

Mt. Gox confirmed the unexpected contents of the old wallet on March 7 and reported it to the Court, then moved it to offline wallets for security reasons . They wouldn't want to lose it again, now, would they?

While coming across an unsuspected fortune of forgotten cryptocurrency is the stuff of dreams for Bitcoiners—it’s certainly been known to happen among those who took a punt on Bitcoin early on—this discovery isn’t all cause for celebration.

On the one hand, it does make the chances of some kind of refund for those who lost money when the exchange went down look a bit more likely; there’s more in the pot. But while 200,000 BTC is a lot of money, it’s only a fraction of what was lost. As the filing states, “Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.”

And what’s perhaps most worrying about the whole scenario is the fact that Mt Gox managed to “lose” 200,000 bitcoins in the first place. It’s one thing for an individual miner to absent-mindedly chuck their personal Bitcoin wallet in a landfill, but it’s another for a company trusted to deal with other people’s money to just “forget” about a $100 million cache.

As Motherboard’s Alex Pasternack has previously written, despite all of the faith in Bitcoin’s math, trust in humans (first and foremost those running the exchanges and other Bitcoin businesses) is still essential to using the cryptocurrency. Surprises—even good ones—don’t exactly fill people with confidence when it comes to dealing with their finances.

This latest episode will only raise more questions about quite how poor record-keeping at Mt. Gox was, and will do little to raise the company’s reputation. One look at the Reddit Bitcoin community’s reactions makes it clear people aren’t exactly jumping for joy at Mt. Gox’s sudden windfall.

The details of the whole debacle are still mired in mystery right now as court proceedings continue, and this latest twist comes with a disclaimer on the initial reported loss: "Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation."

The only really good surprise for those who lost money through Mt. Gox's collapse right now would be if they got all of their bitcoins back. Unfortunately, it's still looking like that really would be a surprise.###3231||Privacy Policy (Updated: 5/18/18)

Beto O'Rourke, Stephen Colbert said on Monday's Late Show. "It's been very contentious, the polls are incredibly close, and both candidates are spending tens of millions of dollars to win this thing. So I wanted to send a correspondent down there who could deliver a thorough, nuanced report for The Late Show. And coincidentally, my friend Conan O'Brien is on hiatus right now, so he was kind enough to lend us the one reporter who I believe is able to meet those high standards," Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.

Triumph, Colbert explained, was the right dog for the job because he'd tried and failed to grab an interview with Cruz when he was running for president in 2016. "I followed Ted Cruz from Iowa all the way to New Hampshire, and I never got to meet him, despite being the only person in the world who wants to," Triumph told Colbert. This time he had better luck. He ribbed Cruz harder than O'Rourke, but Cruz also made more of an effort to join in on the insult comedy, to mixed effect.###3234||Empty###3235||Mt. Gox, the Tokyo bitcoin exchange that collapsed and filed for bankruptcy last month, said it had found 200,000 bitcoins that were held in a digital storage file.

Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement on the company’s website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching files that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed.

Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today’s rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million.

Plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the Bankruptcy Court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site.###3236||Did Wal-Mart just put GameStop out of business? That's the question buzzing around Tuesday morning on the heels of news that the superstore chain is re-starting its video game trade-in program, a move that positions the retailer to take a huge bite out of GameStop's core business strategy. As a result of the speculation, shares of GameStop are down about 6% in early morning trading.

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday morning that starting March 26, customers will be able to trade in their old video games in exchange for gift cards that can be used towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, in stores or online. Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide and accepting games used on consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360, the move marks a direct threat to GameStop, whose 6,488 stores do significant business in the pre-owned video game category. In its third fiscal quarter in January, GameStop said it saw pre-owned sales increase 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, or 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also said in January that gross margins for the pre-owned category are expected to range from 46% to 49% for both its fourth quarter and its full fiscal year.

Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S, acknowledged that the company is "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," saying that gaming is important category to Wal-Mart. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,” Mac Naughton said in a statement Tuesday morning.

It's worth noting that this is Wal-Mart's second attempt at entering the pre-owned video game market; in 2009, the superstore chain introduced kiosks that customers could use to trade in their old video games, but the program failed to work and was suspended in 2010. More recently the retailer was quietly accepting trade-ins online, but in partnering with CE Exchange, the company behind Wal-Mart's tablet and smartphone trade-in program, Wal-Mart is clearly hoping this newest attempt at capturing the pre-owned video game market will be more successful.

It remains to be seen if Wal-Mart's new program is appealing to hard-core gamers, who often trade in old games just to buy new ones -- and not things like clothes or sports equipment or other Wal-Mart products. If enough video game customers aren't interested in Walmart or Sam's Club dollars, GameStop could very well emerge from this test unscathed.

Following Wal-Mart's announcement, shares of GameStop initially sank more than 7% in Tuesday's pre-market trading session; the stock is currently down about 6.3%. Year-to-date, the video game retailer has trailed the market, posting a near-20% decline for 2014 thus far. It finished 2013 trading with a 92% return. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, was relatively unmoved in Tuesday's pre-market trading: the stock is currently down just .08%. Year-to-date, the superstore is down 5.4%.###3237||A NEW 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that three per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: “After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of “We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit.”

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the “exciting project”, adding: “The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

“It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

“We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.”

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: “Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: “The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.”

By Emily Stephenson

WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and other banks will find out if the Federal Reserve thinks they can cope with the next financial crisis when it publishes the results of an annual health check on Thursday.

If the Fed finds that any of the 30 banks subject to the so-called stress tests are still at risk, the banks will then have a few days to change any plans they may have made to return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buy-backs.

Most banks are expected to pass the exam, but analysts will closely watch the results. Last year, American Express lowered its capital distribution proposal after the first submission.

And banks may have been more willing to take risks with their initial plans this year, now that they have been building up capital in the years since the crisis.

“These banks are very well capitalized and I know they’re going to want to get more aggressive each incremental year in terms of what they ask for,” said Fred Cannon, global director of research for Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.

The annual testing has become an increasingly important tool for regulators to ensure that banks are not eating too much into their capital cushions, by examining how banks would weather a hypothetical major market shock.

Analysts said the biggest U.S. banks will probably meet the Fed’s requirements, having reduced their leverage, the amount of debt compared to shareholder equity, since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Bigger fireworks could come next week, when the Fed will either approve or reject each firm’s plans to pay dividends to shareholders or buy back shares.

The Fed conducts stress tests each year to measure how banks’ loan books and security portfolios would hold up under extreme economic scenarios not unlike those experienced during the last crisis.

Thirty banks participated in this set of tests, up from 18 last year.

The first chunk of results is meant to show banks’ relative strength if each firm made the same capital moves. The Fed assumed each bank would pay dividends equal to the average of the past four quarters, and buy back no shares.

Last year, only Ally Financial failed to meet the minimum 5 percent capital buffer in the first round of the tests.

In a new hurdle imposed this year, the biggest eight banks had to consider what would happen to their business if their largest trading counterparty were to default.

The Fed will make its own projections for bank balance sheets this year, and banks may release results of their internal stress tests if they disagree.

Many already are, decriminalizing possession of smaller amounts of pot, as well as legalization for medical purposes.

Sales in Colorado have been stellar, and the state is reaping the benefits, big time. In the first month alone, licensed dispensaries hit a whopping $14 million dollars in sales, and the state received a cool $2 million of those proceeds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year — about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

And then there is big tobacco, with companies seeing a serious decline in sales in the U.S., are forced to turn their markets to other countries, and pushing their deadly fares in China, Russia and India, to name a few. Smokers in the US have dropped to less than half of the people who smoked in the 1950’s. Smokers are becoming a thing of the past. It is a known fact that tobacco kills and as such, many states have banned smoking in any public buildings or structures.

With the popularity of tobacco declining, and the popularity of marijuana on the rise, following the medical marijuana legalization in 20 states and recreational legalization in Colorado and Washington, and at least 58 percent of Americans agreeing that it should be legalized, it appears pot already has replaced tobacco smoking in America, and the tobacco industry would be crazy not to get on board.

With all of this cash to be made from an alternative smoking product, why not? However, when the largest tobacco company in the U.S., Philip Morris, was asked the question about the future intentions of its company, spokesman Bill Phelps told CBS: “We have a practice of not commenting or speculating on future business. Adding, tobacco companies are in the business of manufacturing and marketing tobacco products.”

But one can rest assured, if governments continue to treat smoking as the public health menace it is, the tobacco industry may not have a future at all, at least in the U.S. And as marijuana popularity continues to grow, thereby inadvertently replacing tobacco products, it could save their imminent decline, so it makes perfect sense.

But there is another entity that could take the marijuana boom to a new level, and that is the liquor industry.

The Washington State Liquor Control Board is receiving plenty of applications from people who want to be certified to be able to grow pot legally, even though the agency is not yet soliciting such applications. The agency’s spokesman Brian Smith said Tuesday that some applications so far have come from people who have long been growing marijuana when it was against state law.

“We’re getting a lot of interest from people that want to be producers,” Smith said. “Some say they have been growing it illegally until now.”

Where pot will go commercially is still unknown, but it is bound to happen soon.

Image via YouTube###3241||Empty###3242||Months after the launch of legalized retail marijuana in Colorado, the state is still trying to better regulate the drug and close the loopholes.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, as part of that effort, just signed a new law calling for uniform packaging of edible marijuana. In an effort to make those products less attractive or accessible to kids, they will have to be sold in opaque, childproof packaging.

State Rep. Daniel Kagan, who co-sponsored the legislative fixes, explained: "We identified these problems and we sought to tighten it up, to make sure that marijuana is really kept for adult use and kept away from under-aged persons and especially from toddlers."

Kagan added, "We do it differently in Colorado. Everybody came together on this."

Children's Hospital, based in Aurora, has weighed in on the legislative efforts -- reporting an increase in emergency room visits and patient admissions from accidental exposure.

Dr. Sam Wang, pediatric emergency physician, said symptoms range from basic sleepiness to more severe cases, where children have not been able to breathe properly and required breathing tubes. "As recreational marijuana goes forward, it's obviously going to increase availability and potentially increase unintentional exposures as well," Wang said.

Other fixes signed by the governor on Monday include giving authority to pot shops to confiscate forms of identification, if they have reason to believe someone underaged is using a fake ID. Another measure calls for local jurisdictions to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal record checks on people working in marijuana businesses.

State Sen. Linda Newell, a Democratic co-sponsor, acknowledged their work is not done. "We will probably find these clean-up bills as we go through the years after marijuana, both medical marijuana as well as recreational marijuana, has become a norm in Colorado," she said.

The issue of stoned drivers is another trouble spot for state lawmakers. At a laboratory certified to test blood samples for marijuana, the director told Fox News there is not a roadside test, such as a breathalyzer, in the foreseeable future for determining if a driver is under the influence of cannabis.

"One person may have a very high THC concentration in their blood, particularly medical marijuana users, and they're not affected. Where someone who has never smoked marijuana before, will have a much lower concentration and be very affected," said Dr. Robert Lantz, of Rocky Mountain Instrumental Laboratories.

According to state Marijuana Enforcement Division Public Information Officer Julie Postlethwait, Colorado has issued licenses to hundreds of vendors, including:

-- 183 retail stores

-- 238 retail cultivation facilities

-- 44 product manufacturers (i.e., edibles)

-- 4 testing facilities (for product potency and contaminants)

Dozens more are pending with the state in these categories. For those with state licenses in hand, they may not be open yet because they have to obtain paperwork at the local level, too.

Local permission can be thorny because Amendment 64, the state constitutional amendment which legalized recreational pot, left it up to municipalities in the Centennial State to decide whether to allow marijuana businesses within their borders.

Dale Dyke and Chastity Osborn, a husband-and-wife team who converted their home into a bed and breakfast, complained that the "laws are very gray." Their business Get High Getaways was catering to marijuana tourists until the City of Lakewood ordered them to shut down the overnight stays. One complication is that while Colorado legalized recreational pot, the state left it illegal to use the drug outside in public or in traditional hotel rooms. For now, the couple is maintaining their location as a car service while working with investors to purchase a new location.

Recently, a marijuana job fair in Denver drew thousands of people with lines stretching a few blocks long. It has been referred to in local media reports as a "green rush."

Visitors told Fox News they're moving to the state in hopes of finding jobs in the marijuana business. Shane Wylie and Matthew Bean are among them. They drove 1,300 miles from Louisiana, just in time for the fair.

"This is our life-changing experience, this is our big step and career change," Wylie explained. Bean added, "I want to start from the bottom, so I can learn everything."

It was the fifth straight month that unemployment fell in Louisiana.

In January, 1,990,531 people were employed in Louisiana, helping lower the state's unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, according to figures released from state labor officials.

Seasonally adjusted data released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that there were 25,787 more people employed this January than were employed in January 2013; while there were 102,47 people unemployed, translating to 29,310 fewer people not working the year earlier.

The national unemployment rate for January was at 6.6 percent.

In January, Louisiana's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was at its lowest since September 2008 and lowest in the 17-state southern region, where 6.2 percent was the average rate.

The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved in every parish and in all eight metropolitan areas for January 2014. Baton Rouge's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent, from 7.1 percent the year prior. New Orleans' rate decreased to 5.1 percent, down from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

"2014 is picking up right where 2013 left off," said Curt Eysink, executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission in a statement. "Our labor markets are strong and we expect employment will continue to increase as billions of dollars of new projects ramp up during the next three or four years."

The total number of people employed and unemployed, more commonly known as Louisiana's civilian labor force, was 2,093,007 in January, 3,523 fewer than January 2013.

Seasonally adjusted total non-farm employment was 1,956,300 in January. According to the BLS, leisure and hospitality increased the most among all employment sectors with a 10,000-job increase over the year.

Other industries experiencing large increases included transportation, trade and utilities at 5,300; education and health services with a 4,200 jump; and the manufacturing industry with a 2,700 increase.

The largest decline, however, came in the government sector. About 7,200 fewer federal, state and local jobs were counted than in January 2013. Also declining were the information industry, which lost 2,500 jobs; and the mining and logging industry, which decreased by 700 jobs.

###3247||Bentonville – Walmart is getting in on a business that impacts more than 110 million gamers across the country.

Starting Wednesday (March 26), customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value towards purchases of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online, according to a news release Tuesday.

The games will be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase at a lower price, according to the news release.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,” Naughton said.

Here is how it works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online.

Later this year, customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and online. They will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned.”###3248||DENVER — Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper — who opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in his state — said Monday he hasn't seen the economic fallout he feared.

Hickenlooper, whose priority has been luring businesses and entrepreneurs to Denver, Boulder, and other hubs, had worried a view of Colorado's as the stoner state could "distort all the work that we've done" in presenting a pro-business image, he said in an interview.

"We haven't seen it yet," he said of the feared negative economic impact. "That's why we have been so aggressive and rigorous with implementing the regulations."

The referendum legalized the use of marijuana, as well as possession of up to an ounce, for all Colorado residents over 21. Titled "Amendment 64," it went into effect on Dec. 10, 2012, after passing by a 9% margin of the popular vote the previous month, though legal sales of marijuana didn't begin until January of this year.

Hickenlooper, to the fury of the referendum's supporters, opposed it, but has worked with the nascent legal industry to impose a strict regulatory and tax regime — and he said the industry has been as cooperative as he always thought it would be.

"We predicted that this would be an industry that would function like any other industry — that they would be no more or less driven or acquisitive than any other industry and they would be no more or less given to regulation and supporting regulation," Hickenlooper said between bites of breakfast burrito at a long desk in his Capitol office. "They look at their self-interest just like another business, but it's a whole different framework: No one has ever had a self-interest like this, where they have got to protect the right to do in a state what's illegal nationally."

"The industry was a great supporter of our very stiff tax rates; generally they've been supportive of our pretty stiff regulation," he said.

Colorado residents can purchase up to an ounce of marijuana only from specialty licensed retail shops. Currently, only already-existing medical marijuana dispensaries are eligible for a recreational license, though this restriction will lift in October of this year. Retailers must properly label all products with clear information regarding warnings, serving size, and potency, and any marijuana magazines must be treated like pornography by being placed behind the counter. Additionally, those who choose to grow their own plants at home are limited to six plants, with only three flowering at any given time.

Hickenlooper said his main remaining worry is polling suggesting that legalization has persuaded young people that marijuana is perfectly safe, when many neurologists believe it can impair a developing brain.

He also said the benefits of tax revenues from the legal product can be overstated.

"The other governors tease me, they say, 'I wouldn't be so rigorous if I had $130 million in tax revenue projected,'" he said. "But that's a drop in the bucket compared to how the world thinks of your state as a place to build a business."

Hickenlooper, indeed, is running for reelection on a platform of economic growth and pro-business management. His state weathered the economic crisis better than most, and his regular emails to supporters bely much concern that marijuana has derailed its growth.

"While the rest of the country's economy is slowly picking back up, we're thriving here in Colorado," he wrote earlier this month.

Weed also appears unlikely to be a central election issue. Hickenlooper opponent Bob Beauprez recently told ABC News that he'd look for "a way to agree with" Hickenlooper on marijuana regulation.

Hickenlooper said he was "surprised" that Beauprez, a former congressman, had chosen to enter the race. "I would have thought he would have supported a lot of our economic development stuff," he said.

Colorado, though, is the fulcrum of nearly every other divisive issue in the country: Hickenlooper is under assault from the right for his support of gun control, and from the left for backing the natural gas extraction technique known as fracking. Republicans, in particular, see an opportunity in tying Hickenlooper to the Affordable Care Act, which he supports, although Colorado's state-run health insurance exchange has not been as troubled as HealthCare.gov.

"I am concerned that it is going to be a difficult year for Democrats and I am going to be painted with that same brush," he said. And while he pointed to a rare decrease in the rate of growth in health care costs as a sign that the Affordable Care Act's cost-control measures are working, he says he doesn't expect that to help much with the politics. He also said he doesn't anticipate wanting President Obama (or any other out-of-state figure) to campaign for him.

"As a campaign thing, when I walk into a room and say how many people hate the ACA, half of the hands or two-thirds of the hands in the room go up," he said.

Hickenlooper also quietly came out for marriage equality toward the bottom of a press release March 3, a decision he described Monday as a "nuance" and natural evolution from his longtime support for equal civil marriage rights, while leaving churches free to make their own decisions.

"The debate had changed sufficiently that I think people can understand that supporting civil marriage is a way of saying I support every single right for every single person," he said.###3249||Attention Walmart shoppers: you may now trade-in games at the media department at select store across the United States.

Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as CEO in July 2012, with the goal of positioning Symantec to compete with a new generation of security companies, The Wall Street Journal reported.

However, Bennett had reportedly yet to deliver on new products.

"We weren’t making enough progress in product innovation," The Wall Street Journal reported a person close to the board as having said. "We were not seeing revenue growth."

Symantec has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO as it begins its search for a permanent CEO.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth," company chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Schulman also acknowledged the work Bennett has done for the company.

"We recognise Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," Schulman said.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5pc organic revenue growth and better-than 30pc non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

Symantec’s revenue sank 4.8pc to US$1.7bn in the period ended 27 December. Yesterday, the company said revenue in the current quarter would amount to US$1.62bn to US$1.66bn, down from US$1.75bn a year earlier. Shares fell nearly 7pc in after-hours trading yesterday. Previously, they were down nearly 15pc over the past 12 months.###3251||NEW YORK � Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart stores for store credit but not cash. The credit can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

''Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,'' said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that Wal-Mart works with on its trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy offer used video trade in programs, but the Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

Wal-Mart made a point of saying that credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with ''modest'' success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

''History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,'' he wrote in a client note.

Wal-Mart shares rose 23 cents to $74.92 in morning trading.###3252||Empty###3253||WASHINGTON - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

WASHINGTON � Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said yesterday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state � Iowa � where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that�s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month.

Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrate that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That�s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more-positive view of the nation�s job market than the employer survey did.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state�s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next-highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.

North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil- and gas-drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.

Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn�t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.

The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.

California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.###3254||surged to new intra-day high levels on Tuesday after opened on a positive note following postive global cues.

Asian shares rose on Tuesday and the yen remained well off recent highs as the threat of immediate military conflict in Ukraine receded, though investors remained cautious ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve policy meeting.

On Wall Street on Monday, US stocks turned in a solid performance, with the S&P 500 adding about 1%.

The United States and the European Union imposed sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on a small group of officials from Russia and Ukraine after the weekend referendum.

Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1%, recovering from a six-week closing low hit on Monday.

For the time being, risk appetite improved as the likelihood of immediate military conflict faded, and participants turned their attention back to the US economic outlook and the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting on Wednesday.

The Fed is expected to continue to stick to reducing its monthly asset purchases by an additional $10 billion, and could also alter its forward guidance in its statement.

Fed policymakers could adopt less specific language to describe conditions under which it might tighten policy, instead of the bank's current threshold of a 6.5% unemployment rate for considering a rate rise. The rate now stands at 6.7%, though Fed officials are still signalling that rates need to stay low for some time to support the economy.

The dollar was slightly higher on the day at 101.78 yen, while the euro added about 0.1% to 141.80 yen.

The euro edged up about 0.1% to $1.3932, within sight of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 touched on Thursday.

The single currency's resilience was despite data on Monday showing a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to back the view that the European Central Bank needs to take further monetary steps to support growth.

The improvement in risk sentiment took a toll on gold, which hit a six-month high on Monday before plunging more than 1%. It was last down about 0.4% at $1,360.21 per ounce, well shy of the previous session's peak of $1,391.76.

US crude edged down 0.1% to $97.97 a barrel, falling for the second day in a row, as expectations of growing petroleum stockpiles in the world's biggest oil user offset any fears that Ukraine tensions could worsen.

A third set of images, this one from a French satellite, show potential objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean that could be linked to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, which has been missing since March 8, when it disappeared from radar screens.

The images, clarified by the French ministry as satellite-generated radar echoes, or radar signals that give information about an object's location, do not seem to have been publicly released, though they were immediately sent to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is now coordinating the plane search near Perth, according to the Malaysian Ministry of Transport.

The newly spotted object or objects were floating about 1,430 miles (2,300 kilometers) from Perth, Australia, according to the Sunday Times, a Singapo

re news site. [Facts about Malaysia Flight 370]

Satellite images from both China and Australia have revealed floating objects that may be Flight 370 debris in the same area over the past week.

The Malaysian Ministry of Transport didn't provide any other details about the French image or images or the object's location, the New York Times reported.

Even so, the image or images may solidify the idea that the plane fell into the ocean off Western Australia, after radically departing from its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, according to the Times.

The new image will also be compared with the past images of possible debris. The March 16 Australian satellite images of possible debris, which were released on March 20, showed two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysian aircraft, according to the AMSA. The objects (marked by arrows in the satellite images) measure up to 79 feet (24 meters) long and 16 feet (5 m) long, respectively, according to a Reuters report. (Searches in the area have yet to turn up the floating objects.)

The more recent Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released Saturday (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The image showed a large object — about 72 feet (22 m) by 43 feet (13 m) — some 75 miles (120 km) southwest of the location of the possible debris sighted by the Australian satellite, according to SASTIND officials. (The AMSA plotted the object and though its location fell within Saturday's search area it was not sighted, the AMSA reported.)

The new French satellite photo is the latest clue in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 jet; the search effort has focused on two vast swaths of ocean, one stretching north from Malaysia toward Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and another stretching south across the Indian Ocean.

Today's search involved eight aircraft, including a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon, along with the Royal Navy's HMAS Success, covering an area of nearly 23,000 square miles (59,000 square km) across two search regions within the Australia Search and Rescue Region in the southern Indian Ocean southwest of Perth.

The search will continue Monday, with the Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft and Japanese P-3C aircraft expected to join the effort, according to the AMSA.

Ooooh! Let’s throw a Brosurance keg party!!!

The March Obamacare numbers are surging! Yes, in just the first two weeks of March, the number of “enrollees” has surged 800,000 from 4.2 million to 5 million. How do I know this? Because the Department of Health and Human Services told me so and the most “transparent” administration in history would never fib, would they? If you think that your humble correspondent is incredibly naive for blindly swallowing the HHS Obamacare numbers, I am just reflecting the attitude of a report at NBC News written by senior health writer Maggie Fox acting as if she were a stenographer for the HHS PR department:

“Five million people have now signed up for health insurance on the state and federal online exchanges, the Obama administration said Monday — a number that suggests a big-last minute surge to get coverage.

“The new figures suggest a final push by the White House to get people to enroll is working. The deadline to get signed up for 2014 is March 31, just two weeks away. As of March 1, the Health and Human Services Department said 4.2 million people had signed up.”

I am so excited that I can hardly contain myself! But after that moment of excitement, nagging questions start to gnaw at me. Like questions about how many of those supposed enrollees have actually paid for their Obamacare? Ms Fox conveniently refrains from exploring that piece of data but many of her readers in the comments section express the healthy skepticism that Fox completely avoids:

“HHS actually tells you it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to know how many people have actually paid, this despite word from the Insurance Industry that they have been reporting these numbers to HHS all along.

“Less than 2% of Americans get Obama Care. But how many people had their insurance cancel them because of the changes?

“Now 1 million people have signed up in the last 2 weeks???????????? Since we are getting these #’s, how about the number of people who have active , paid for coverage now?????”

We landed a man on the moon 35 years ago. We invented wireless communication. We basically are living much like the cartoon Jetsons. Yet we can’t count how many people have paid for the policy? This defies common sense.

Further searches, by Australian, New Zealand and US planes, were needed to find out if they were part of the missing plane.

Others have speculated that the pilot or co-pilot may have intentionally crashed the plane. The FBI is trying to restore deleted simulator-flights from Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah's computer – but these could be innocuous. Critics of the crash theory say neither the pilot nor co-pilot had ever expressed any kind of radical sentiment or displayed mental issues, and both possessed adequate flying experience.

Theories abound. Fellow pilot Chris Goodfellow has suggested that a tyre may have caught fire, causing the pilots to turn towards the closest suitable airport, with the rapid ascent and descent perhaps representing an attempt to extinguish the fire. Critics of this theory have pointed out that the change in path was programmed into the plane's computer 12 minutes before the calm toned "good night" transmission, suggesting the change in course was planned.

At 1.30am, on point 4, the plane is spotted for the last time on civilian radar. At 2.15am, on point 5, military radar spots it, although it is not clear at the time that this was MH370. Satellite data suggests the plane could also have angled towards point 6.

Forensic experts examining the home flight simulator of Malaysia Airlines pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah have found nothing suspicious, collapsing the only significant lead investigators have been pursuing to try to solve the mystery disappearance of MH370, police sources say.

Investigators became suspicious last week when they discovered Zaharie, 53, had deleted logs on a computer linked to the simulator on February 3, almost five weeks before the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board inexplicably turned around during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and was still flying more than seven hours later.

The computer hard drive was sent to FBI experts in the US to search for evidence of some kind of hijacking plot.

Zaharie and his co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, have been a key focus of investigations after Malaysian authorities said they believed a “deliberate action” by someone on board caused the plane to lose communications and then turn around from its scheduled flight path.

Intensive scrutiny of Zaharie’s background has failed uncover any links to extremists groups or terrorism.

Investigations have also failed to find anything suspicious in the background of Fariq, who was due soon to marry another pilot.

Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein was expected to announce that police had found nothing suspicious on the simulator at a media briefing in Kuala Lumpur late on Saturday, Malaysian time.

Australia has cautioned that their investigations in the southern Indian Ocean remained a tentative one.



Officials are bracing for the "long haul" as searches by more than two dozen countries turn up little but frustration and fresh questions about Flight MH370 which vanished on a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8.



Six aircraft and two merchant ships are now scouring an area of the remote southern Indian Ocean where suspected debris was spotted by satellite earlier this week.



Australia, which announced the potential find and is coordinating the rescue, has cautioned the objects might be a lost shipping container or other debris.



"Even though this is not a definite lead, it is probably more solid than any other lead around the world and that is why so much effort and interest is being put into this search," acting Australian Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters at a Perth airforce base.



China, Japan and India are sending more planes and Australian and Chinese navy vessels are also steaming towards the zone, more than 2,000km southwest of Perth.



Weather conditions are good, with 10 km of visibility, according to search officials - a crucial boost for a search that is relying more on human eyes than the technical wizardry of the most advanced aircraft in the world.



"While these aircraft are equipped with very advanced technology, much of this search is actually visual," said Truss, who also warned that the objects detected by satellites may now be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.



"It is a very remote area, but we intend to continue the search until we are absolutely satisfied that further searching would be futile, and that day is not in sight," he said.



Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman John Young said the operation was still considered search and rescue.



"The plan is we want to find these objects because they are the best lead to where we might find people to be rescued," he said.



CLOCK TICKING



Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said searchers were facing the "long haul" but were conscious that the clock was ticking. The plane's "black box" voice and data recorder only transmits an electronic signal for about 30 days before its battery dies, after which it will be far more difficult to locate.



Aircraft and ships have also renewed the search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas that have already been exhaustively swept to find some clue to unlock one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation.



Investigators suspect the Boeing 777, which took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing shortly after midnight on March 8, was deliberately diverted thousands of miles from its scheduled path. They say they are focusing on hijacking or sabotage but have not ruled out technical problems.



The Telegraph newspaper published what it said was a transcript of communications between the cockpit of Flight MH370 and Malaysian air control, but few if any new clues emerged.



The search itself has strained ties between China and Malaysia, with Beijing repeatedly leaning on the Southeast Asian nation to step up its hunt and do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers.



For families of the passengers, the process has proved to be an emotionally wrenching battle to elicit information, their angst fuelled by a steady stream of speculation and false leads.



Some experts have argued that the reluctance to share sensitive radar data and capabilities in a region fraught with suspicion amid China's military rise and territorial disputes may have hampered the search.



Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been slowed in some cases by delays over the paperwork to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.



Truss said he was grateful for the search craft offered by China and others, which are expected to arrive at the Australian airforce base on Saturday.



Australian rescue coordinators said they are awaiting confirmation of the planes and ships offered before they are included in any search schedules.

-Reuters and Fairfax Australia###3260||WASHINGTON -- The United States has slapped fresh sanctions on individuals close to President Vladimir Putin over Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, penalties that officials and legal experts say could severely restrict the targeted Russians' ability to do business throughout the world.U.S. President Barack Obama announced the measures, aimed at senior Russian officials, wealthy businessmen in Putin's "inner circle," and Bank Rossiya, which has close ties to Russia's leadership."Based on the executive order that I signed in response to Russia's initial intervention in Ukraine, we are imposing sanctions on more senior officials of the Russian government," Obama said. "In addition, we are today sanctioning a number of other individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership, as well as a bank that provides material support to these individuals."The administration also vowed that further punitive steps are on the way.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "the question at this point is not if we will do more sanctions, it’s when."Those hit with sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the influential head of Russian Railways, oil trader Gennady Timchenko, and Putin’s chief of staff and close associate, Sergei Ivanov, as well as a handful of others.The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned Bank Rossiya -- among the country's 20 largest banks -- which it called “the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”Its chairman, Yury Kovalchuk, was also placed on the sanctions list.A senior U.S. administration official told reporters in a call that the named individuals “will be unable to access any U.S. financial services, will find it difficult to transact in the dollar, and I suspect will find it very difficult to transact in Europe and elsewhere, as our partners around the world have demonstrated over time a willingness to also adhere to the sanctions that we are imposing."Russian officials included in an initial round of U.S. sanctions on March 17 scoffed at that move, saying they had neither any assets in the United States nor any desire to visit the country.But another senior U.S. official who spoke to journalists by phone after this latest round insisted that the sanctions have teeth.“People may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not,” the official said.Legal experts said the fresh sanctions could create havoc for the designated individuals as they try to conduct business, particularly when trying to move money around the world.Douglas McNabb, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in financial sanctions and extradition law, said that "even some banks that don’t have corresponding relations with the U.S. still won’t have anything to do with individuals who have been designated.”One of the targeted individuals, Timchenko, is a Soviet-born Finnish citizen who until this week was a co-owner of the oil-trading company Gunvor, which has a head office in Geneva and a registered office in Cyprus.Gunvor issuedsoon after the announcement saying that in anticipation of "potential economic sanctions," Timchenko on March 19 sold all of his shares in the company to his partner, Swedish businessman Torbjorn Törnqvist.Last year, Reuters reported that Timchenko had hired Washington lobbyists in a bid to secure funding backed by the U.S. government for a luxury aircraft business.Though quickly denied by officials at Gunvor, theon Thursday asserted that "Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds."Meanwhile, Bank Rossiya, with about $10 billion in assets, will be effectively shut out of U.S. dollar activities worldwide and have its correspondent relationships with banks across the globe placed under threat, according to Steve Ganis, an expert on financial sanctions with the Boston law firm Mintz Levin.Obama also announced an executive order signed that enables the U.S. government to introduce sanctions on entire sectors of the Russian economy. A senior administration official said that could include the energy, engineering, financial services, or metals and mining sectors.“Once those sectors are designated...we will then be able to impose sanctions on specific entities within those sectors,” the official said. “This is a flexible tool that we can use in response to further provocations” -- the official said, citing potential Russian incursions into other areas of Ukraine.Boston lawyer Ganis said that sanctions on the Russian energy sector could be “quite disruptive” to Russian energy companies but that such sanctions could also affect global markets and create problems for European countries dependent on Russian energy.A U.S. administration official said Washington is "working actively to prepare additional sanctions under these authorities using their creative breadth to design sanctions that will hurt the entities with...the smallest possible impact on us and our allies."Obama’s is traveling next week to Europe, where he said he will discuss the Ukrainian situation with the United States' Group of Seven (G7) partners.###3261||The new-look £1 coin, designed to be the hardest in the world to fake, has been unveiled. Based on the historic three pence piece, it will be introduced in 2017.

Ahead of Wednesday’s Budget, chancellor George Osborne tweeted an image of the £1 coin next to the Budget Box, saying, “Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin.”

The Royal Mint says that the coin’s launch is necessary because the current coin – which has been in circulation for 30 years – is vulnerable to counterfeiting.

The Treasury-owned body estimates that 3% of all existing £1 coins – about 45 million – are forgeries.

“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency,” they said.

The new coin is based on the design of the ‘threepenny bit’, a 12-sided coin that was used from 1937 to 1971. However, the new design will use pioneering technology developed by the Mint to make it easier to authenticate and much harder to duplicate.

It is hoped that the move will save taxpayers millions by cutting fraud, though in the short term the changeover may prove costly.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Royal Mint’s director of circulating coin sales Andrew Hill admitted that it is likely that coin-accepting machines across the country – such as parking meters and vending machines – will have to be adapted.

This process would cost the economy around £20 million over the next three years, he said.

“Our role is very important – for now it is to consult with our stakeholder and a major stakeholder is the automatic vending association.

“We have to make sure that, as well as being a secure coin, we look at the impact to industry and make sure that we do everything we can to make the changeover as smooth as possible.”

The replacement of the £1 coin follows the Bank of England’s announcement that plastic banknotes are to be brought into circulation in the UK by 2016.

The polymer notes are also said to be more difficult to counterfeit, more durable and resistant to water.

Funny story: that just happened to Mt. Gox, the troubled bitcoin exchange now mired in Japanese bankruptcy proceedings.

In a document released yesterday, Mark Karpelès, Mt Gox's 28-year-old CEO, announced that:

Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old ­format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC (199,999.99 BTC).

Of course, Karpelès writes, as soon as Mt. Gox discovered the missing bitcoins it brought the discovery to the attention of the Japanese judge in charge of the bankruptcy. Everything on the up-and-up.

Karpelès goes on to explain that this means that actually, Mt. Gox is missing fewer bitcoins due to the alleged hack that led it into bankruptcy:

MtGox Co., Ltd. had previously reported... that MtGox Co., Ltd. had lost almost all of the approximately 850,000 bitcoins it held... Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.

So, doing the math, there's been an overnight 23.5% reduction in the losses Mt. Gox suffered as a result of its alleged hack. This is nothing short of a Vernal Equinox Miracle. Four or five more little discoveries like this and the whole thing will be in the clear.

And don't worry, continues Karpelès:

(Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation.)

In other words, sit tight, every bitcoin person who may have lost large sums here! Do not pay attention to the men behind the curtain at Reddit, or the lawyers in that class action suit filed in a Chicago federal court, who believe that something fishy went on here.

Definitely don't read this Wired article about Karpelès' management practices inside Mt. Gox itself.

No, just sit tight. An investigation is ongoing. Karpelès has it covered.

Andrew O'Day takes it up a level.###3266||Backed by a court order, Turkey has clamped a ban on Twitter. Prime minister Recep Tayyib Erdogan said on Thursday before the Twitter blackout that the government now had a court order. Erdogan's government has been rocked by revelations of a scandal in social media. Erdogan declared that Turkey would eradicate Twitter and he did not care what the international community said. He added, everyone would witness the power of the Turkish Republic. Erdogan's showdown with Twitter had long been coming. In mid-2013, thousands protested against a proposed urban development of Istanbul's Taksim Gezi Park, but many said the discontent was more rooted in the government's shift away from secularism and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression. As in many countries, social media was instrumental in rallying the protesters, which included as many as 3.5 million people in a nation of 81 million. Outraged by the growing opposition to his administration, Erdogan called all social media the ''worst menace to society.'' Over the last few months, with the approaching elections social media Erdogan had become increasingly resentful and intolerant of social media. The fact, however remains that Erdogan, who doesn't follow anyone, has 4.17 million Twitter followers and has unleashed 3,043 tweets. Two weeks ago, following the release of recordings which showed someone sounding like Erdogan telling his son to dispose of a large sum of cash, the prime minister's patience snapped. Calling the recordings a ''fabrication'' he ultimately blamed social media. Turkey had in the past blocked access to YouTube, but this comes as the first ban on Twitter, which was instrumental in organising flash protests against the government last year. A lawyers' association, has meanwhile, asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. The country's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation of the court order. European Commission vice president Neelie Kroes criticised the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that was seeking to join the EU as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, voiced concern over the development. According to Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, his office was merely obeying court orders. The social network had been accused of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and he said access would be restored only when Twitter removed illegal content. He said Turkey was not a country that banned the internet.

Investing.com - The yen weakened slightly against the dollar on Wednesday after Japan's February trade deficit reached ¥800 billion, wider than the ¥590 billion expected, but narrower than the deficit of ¥2.79 trillion in January.



USD/JPY traded at 101.4, after the data and ahead of a 1030 Tokyo time (0130 GMT), Bank of Japan board member Takahide Kiuchi speech to business leaders in western Japan and BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is also due to join a Tokyo panel discussion from 1400 to 1715 (0500-0815 GMT).



The Australian dollar remained flat after a private survey showed a downbeat trend for economic expectations.



AUD/USD traded at 0.9126, up 0.02%. Australia's Westpac-MI March leading index fell 0.1%, showing a sharp loss of momentum since February's drop of 0.2% marked the first sub-trend reading since December 2012.



NZD/USD traded at 0.8608, down 0.12%, after New Zealand's fourth quarter current account balance narrowed to a deficit of NZ1.43 billion, from a deficit of NZ$4.88 billion and slightly above an expected NZ$1.41 billion, reflecting strong goods and services trade.



Overnight, the dollar traded mixed to higher against most major currencies on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin assured the world Moscow is not out to annex Ukraine, while expectations for the Federal Reserve to trim its monthly bond-buying program offset hit-or-miss U.S. housing indicators.



Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy.



Elsewhere, The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.



Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.



Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.



The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.



Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.



The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase..



U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.



The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.01% at 79.53.



On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is to announce its decision on interest rates and monetary policy followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen, her first as head of the monetary authority.###3268||Empty###3269||-

Listen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src="https://www.marketplace.org/2014/03/18/business/why-wal-mart-will-buy-your-used-video-game/popout" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="240px"></iframe>

The market for used video games is in the neighborhood of $2 billion. It's way beyond folks selling on Craigslist. Big global retailers, like GameStop, make massive profits selling used games. The gaming retailer's profit margin on used products is nearly 50 percent, far more than it makes selling new games and consoles.

Now the largest retailer of all, Wal-Mart, is getting into the market. It's offering store credit for old games, which it'll eventually refurbish and sell.

Other big retailers have tried and failed to shake GameStop’s hold on the lucrative used gaming market. Wal-Mart brings substantial market power and a formidable advertising budget to the table. But even if it doesn't beat GameStop, offering trade-ins will get more people inside Wal-Mart. The retailer is betting gamers will buy other things after they trade in their used games.

Selling used video games may be great for some retailers, but game makers are left out of the profits on the secondary market. Some have made moves to try to stifle the used game market or at least elbow in on the profits. But gaming companies have consistently backed down when gamers have pushed back.

BEFORE YOU GO###3270||(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp's PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam's Club.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

"We know that WMT "invests in price" ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share," Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.

(Reporting by Supriya Kurane and Abhirup Roy in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Savio D'Souza)###3271||Since it was first conducted in 2009, the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) for banks has been tracked quite closely by banks, lawmakers, investors and also the public at large. This is because the review process – and quite specifically the stress test conducted as a part of it – is an important tool in the financial regulator’s arsenal to ensure that the country’s financial system can withstand an extreme adverse economic scenario in the future. As these tests aim to gauge the strength of each of the country’s largest financial institutions under conditions similar to those seen during the economic downturn of 2008, they help the Fed advise individual firms about how much they need to shore up their balance sheet if necessary.

Summary results for the fourth iteration of the stress test were released by the Fed Thursday, March 20, and although the process involved 12 more financial institutions compared to last year, there was a clear improvement in overall capital conditions across the industry. [ ] All but one of the firms (Zions Bancorporation) cleared the tests.

In this article, which is the first in our series on the Fed’s stress tests and its implications for the biggest banks reviewed, we simplify the key points to put these tests in perspective and also summarize the results to help understand how the firms fare with respect to each other.

See Full Analysis for: Bank of America | Goldman Sachs | JPMorgan Chase | Morgan Stanley | Citigroup

Understanding The Test Scenario

The purpose of the stress test is to ensure that the banks have enough capital to lend to customers and businesses even under extremely trying economic conditions. The test scenario includes 28 variables (increased from 26 last year) that capture various aspects of the global economy. [ ] Of these, 16 variables relate to the domestic economy and the rest are international variables.

The main domestic variables considered as part of the supervisory scenario for the stress test are:

The U.S. unemployment rate reaches a peak of 11.25%. This figure has hovered around 6.7% over the last three months.

Equity prices witness a 50% drop compared to their value in Q3 2013.

Housing prices dip 25% by mid-2015, represented by a reduction in the house price index. The index has shown healthy quarter-on-quarter growth since early 2012.

The 12 international variables capture the impact of a fall in real GDP growth, inflation, and the U.S./foreign currency exchange rate for the four country/region blocks of the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, developing Asia and Japan.

The underlying idea that clearly emerges here is that if the financial institutions can hold their ground in such an extreme scenario, they will be well-positioned to withstand an adverse, but more probable scenario in the coming quarters.

How Did Each Financial Institution Do?

The key takeaway from the Fed’s stress test is the impact on Tier 1 common ratio for each of the 30 institutions tested under the severely adverse scenario. No doubt, each of the firms will see this benchmark figure fall from current actual values under the test conditions, but the amount it actually falls is governed by a firm’s business model, loan portfolio as well as the type of assets on its balance sheet. The table below represents the change in the Tier 1 common ratio for these firms from their current figure (circle) to their minimum level (diamond) as determined by the test.

The highlighted data point represents the combined performance of all the 30 participating firms. The 5% mark shown is the cut-off required for a firm to pass the stress test. The only bank that fails to meet this standard is Zions. Although Zions is currently in pretty good shape compared to some of its other regional competitors like PNC, SunTrust and even U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), its balance sheet is not strong enough to sustain a downturn.

There are some other interesting things to note here. Custody banks – State Street (NYSE:STT), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), Northern Trust – and card-focused lenders – Discover (NYSE:DFS), American Express (NYSE:AXP) – figure among the best-capitalized firms in the list, and are also the ones least affected by the test scenario. On the other hand, all the globally diversified banks – Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), HSBC (NYSE:HBC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) – are seen at the bottom of the list in terms of worst minimum Tier 1 common ratios as the adverse scenario shaves off between five and eight percentage points from the benchmark for these banks.

What Does This Mean For These Banks Over The Coming Year?

As the stress test incorporates any corporate actions the banks proposed to undertake over the next year – including dividends, share repurchases and major acquisitions/divestitures – a bank which passes the test is almost certain to get its capital plan approved by the Fed (unless the Fed thinks otherwise due to some qualitative factor brought to its notice). While an increase in dividends and modest share buybacks are in the cards for most of the big banks, investors would be most interested in the capital return plans Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley release on March 24, as these three banks have maintained dividends at the token figure of 1 cent since the economic downturn.

Investing.com - The euro touched session lows against the dollar on Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

EUR/USD hit lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.14% to 1.3902.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3878, Monday's low and resistance at 1.3946, Monday's high.

The euro slipped after the ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

The report indicated that the economic upswing in Germany is not at risk. The assessment of current economic conditions improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February.

Economic expectations for the euro area also deteriorated this month, the ZEW Centre said, dropping to 61.5 from 68.5 in February, compared to expectations for a decline to 67.3.

The euro was also lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.38% to 141.11.

The yen found support as caution returned to markets ahead of a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid concerns that tensions over the situation in Ukraine could escalate.

President Putin was due to address both houses of the Russian parliament later Tuesday. On Monday President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The dollar was also lower against the yen, as Monday's relief rally faded. USD/JPY touched session lows of 101.33, and was last down 0.31% to 101.43, not far from Friday's trough of 101.19.###3273||Empty###3274||Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used-video-game market. It's a business dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores.

In an apparent swipe at GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point of saying the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 9 cents to $74.77.

But analysts said the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used-game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.###3275||This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Banning Twitter in Turkey is a violation of democratic rights, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party Kemal Kılıcdaroglu was reported as saying on March 21, Anadolu agency reported.

"The ruling party elected by the people has no right to take such an action," he added.

Access was blocked a few hours after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a statement about such a possibility.

He has recently said that if necessary, the agenda may include the issue of banning the use of Youtube and Facebook to protect its citizens from external influences. However Turkish President Abdullah Gul stressed the impossibility of banning their use.

The Turkish President also said that a complete ban on Twitter is out of the question.

Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.68% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 to October 1, 2018. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###3281||Empty###3282||Daily Events Top

When liberal pro-Obama scholars question the legality of President Barack Obama’s actions to implement Obamacare, the issue of illegal presidential use of power moves from partisan to frightening.

George Washington Law School’s Jonathan Turley is the second most quoted law professor in the nation and a two-time Obama voter. He recently testified before Congress on Obama’s extensive use of executive orders and administrative actions to make unilateral changes in Obamacare, immigration policy, minimum wage and the IRS qualifying standards for non-profit status.

As to Obamacare, Obama, so far, changed it in at least a dozen major ways, including, but not limited to, postponing the employer mandate, allowing insurance carriers to let their insured keep an old policy, and, more recently, redefining the Obamacare “hardship” exemption so broadly as to nullify the individual mandate for at least two more years.

Was this legal?

Turley said: “President Obama has repeatedly violated this (separation of powers) doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. … ” We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.”

Turley challenged Congress to re-assert its authority. “If balance is to be reestablished,” he said, “it must begin before this President leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can ‘go it alone’ — not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.”

Obama sold Obamacare with many now-broken promises. Saving costs was a big one. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office set the net cost of Obamacare at $599 billion over 10 years — citing a gross cost of $848 billion less $249 billion in tax revenues and other cost savings. But recently the CBO revised the 10-year price tag to more than $2 trillion.

Economist Jonathan Gruber, the father of Romneycare — which was the template for Obamacare — recently admitted that well, no, costs will not be going down. “Covering people with health insurance doesn’t save money,” said Gruber. “That was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn’t designed to save money. It’s designed to improve health, and that’s going to cost money.”

So, Obamacare won’t save money, but at least those too poor to afford health insurance will now lead healthier lives, right? Not necessarily.

Oregon expanded its Medicaid program years ago — the way Obamacare does now — to include some of Oregon’s low-income uninsured. Because of costs, Oregon did this on a random lottery basis. Some got it, some, unfortunately, wanted to but couldn’t. But this allows comparisons. Oregon, for example, can now compare the health outcomes of the now-insured Oregonians against those who wanted to get insurance, but couldn’t. Surely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.

But there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes. While the newly insured did increase their doctor visits for preventative and primary-care services, some could not get appointments with doctors, many of whom wouldn’t take new Medicaid patients. Emergency room use went up 40 percent among the new Medicaid patients, not down — all for non-emergency medical needs. Forbes health care researcher Avik Roy writes, “The result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.”

Worse, the uninsured dislike Obamacare even more than do those with health insurance. A recent Kaiser Health poll found that among the uninsured, only 22 percent have a favorable attitude toward Obamacare, a far-lower percentage than the 56 percent of uninsured who are unfavorable toward Obamacare.

Before Obama became president, he said if he were “starting from scratch,” he’d go with a single-payer system. A few months ago, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid was asked whether Obamacare would lead us to single-payer. Reid said, “Absolutely.” This is the real plan.

Single-payer is universal healthcare system used in Canada. It remains popular. But in 2009, the incoming president of the Canadian Medical Association said: “(Canadian doctors) all agree that the system is imploding. We all agree that things are more precarious than perhaps Canadians realize.” What did the outgoing CMA president propose? He said: “A health care revolution has passed us by” and “competition should be welcomed, not feared.” So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.

In the annual index of countries rated on “economic freedom,” the United States — since 2008 — has slipped from the No. 5 position to No. 12. Canada — at No. 6 — is now more “economically free” than the United States! Economic freedom and prosperity go hand in hand.

Yet this administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation. President Obama is quite adept at the former — clueless about how to achieve the latter.

The increase, which contrasted to the 9.5 percent decline in 2012, was mainly attributed to the company's 3G business. The number of 3G mobile subscribers surged 49.3 percent to 103 million by the end of last year.

The company's revenue totaled 321.58 billion yuan, up 13.6 percent year on year, with revenue excluding mobile phone sales at 284.15 billion yuan, up 10 percent from the previous year.

The number of mobile subscribers reached 186 million, up 15.5 percent year on year, said the report.

China Telecom is the nation's largest fixed-line service, and the third largest mobile telecommunications provider in terms of subscriber number after China Mobile and China Unicom.

Its shares on the SEHK slipped 1.25 percent to finish at 3.15 Hong Kong dollars per share on Wednesday.###3284||Empty###3285||investment choice at home and abroad

North Carolina's unemployment rate continued improving in January to near the national average, falling to 6.7 percent, the state Commerce Department reported Monday.



The report was the latest to contain mixed messages about how well the state's economy was shaping up for workers and why. While the report found the number of people employed increased by 17,407 between December and January, another survey found nonfarm payrolls recorded 7,200 fewer jobs.



"We've been in this kind of transitional period for years now. There are times when I say I wish I could have some news that was all good or all bad. If it was all good or all bad, it would be easy to interpret," said Andrew Brod, a senior researcher at the business school at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. "You take the numbers as a whole. They're not all good or all bad."



The state's jobless rate of 6.7 percent in January, down from 6.9 percent in December, was almost on par with the national average of 6.6 percent.



The state rate ranked 33rd in the country in January, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Monday. That's a big improvement over the previous January, when North Carolina's unemployment rate of 9.5 percent was among the worst in the country.



The report also marks a missed goal for Gov. Pat McCrory, who said during a campaign debate weeks before his November 2012 election that he wanted North Carolina's unemployment rate to be more favorable than South Carolina after his first year in office. McCrory took office in January 2013.



"The best way to measure things is to benchmark against your competitors, and within a year I hope we're at least beating South Carolina � my gosh, we ought to be at least beating South Carolina," McCrory said during the October 2012 debate.



But South Carolina's unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent in January.



In an email, McCrory spokesman Ryan Tronovitch said: "Gov. McCrory is focused on long-term, sustainable policies that lead to job growth and we have seen a large drop in the unemployment rate through our first year because of that. South Carolina is stiff competition, and we will continue to do all that we can to get people back to work."



The release of the January data was delayed by about a month as researchers revised and updated previous information, an annual process. The results of the revision indicate that the steady drop in North Carolina's unemployment rate had less to do than previously thought with discouraged workers quitting their struggle to find jobs and no longer being counted, Brod said.



About 60,000 dropped out of the pool of people either holding jobs or looking for work in the year ending in January, while nearly 106,000 left the unemployed list, the state report said. That indicated around 60 percent of the decline in the unemployment rate was due to people ending their job searches, for whatever reason, rather than landing jobs, Brod said.



"In terms of the flight from the labor force, it's looking as though last year wasn't as bad as we previously thought," Brod said.###3288||Empty###3289||Airbnb, the website emblematic of the “sharing economy” that matches up travelers online with people looking to rent out rooms or entire homes, is close to securing fresh funding that would value the business at $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported this morning.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###3290||Symantec has fired its CEO as it looks for fresh leadership to try and lead the company, which has been hit by the ongoing declines in the PC market, making it the second time in two years it has parted company with its top executive.

Symantec announced the end of Steve Bennett's time as CEO with board member Michael Brown taking over as interim president and CEO immediately with the vendor kicking off the search for a full-time replacement.

Bennett had been in the role less than two years after coming in to replace another short term boss Enrique Salem, who left in 2012 after just three years in the job because he had not managed to improve the performance at the firm.

The decision to part with Bennett was described by the vendor as something that had come about after a review of the situation rather than a knee jerk reaction to the most recent set of financial results, which showed that the business was still struggling with a 5% decline in revenues for its third quarter.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said Symantec board chairman Daniel Schulman.

Under Bennett's leadership the firm underwentseveral major changes to improve its fortunes, including making revisions to its partner programmes, making changes to the sales team, splitting into renewals and new business and changing the direct sales outfit to focus on information management or security.

The firm followed that up by taking the wraps off a global channel strategy last November that was based around reseller competencies rewarding those that delivered value to customers by developing their skills.

Schulman said that Bennett had made some positive changes to the way the vendor operated, improving efficiencies and reducing costs but it had to bring on board someone who could improve its fortunes.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth," he said.###3291||MANNHEIM, March 18 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the crisis in Ukraine was the main reason for a sharp decline in Germany’s ZEW survey of investor and analyst sentiment in Europe’s largest economy, a ZEW economist said on Tuesday.

German analyst and investor sentiment fell much more than expected in March, hitting its lowest level since August 2013.###3292||Developers have exerted considerable effort to fix the flaws in the Bitcoin open source software. This effort is aimed at preventing another collapse of a Bitcoin exchange, like what happened to Japan's Mt Gox, according to VentureBeat.

A note about the software update read: "If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version."

The updated Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 now has five modifications that will protect the cryptocurrency from future attacks. The previous version had a flaw that overlooked mutated Bitcoin transactions. Because of that, the records on the Bitcoin blockchain did not match that of Mt Gox's, Gizmodo explained.

The modified software now prevents relaying or mining of those mutated transactions. In addition, the software now promptly reports any irregularities in wallet transactions, the report noted.###3293||Putin Pledges Supports For Sanctions-Hit Lender To Energy Sector

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged his support on Friday for Bank Rossiya, a lender hit by U.S. sanctions which mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.

The bank and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is also one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

"Our companies will continue using the services of the bank," a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following the sanctions.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, instructed the Russian central bank to aid Bank Rossiya, if needed.

"And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand it is a medium-sized bank," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday."

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

The Russian central bank said the measures imposed by the United States would have no significant impact on the financial stability of Bank Rossiya.

"If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors," it said in a statement.

St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, the country's 15th largest in terms of assets, is chaired by Kovalchuk, a close adviser to the president. The friendship between the two men dates back to the early 1990s.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

RELATED COMPANIES###3294||In a sudden move, Symantec (SYMC) has terminated its CEO, Steve Bennett. And Wall Street is definitely concerned, as SYMC stock is off about 12% in today’s trading.

The company tried to calm things down with its press release, which said that the firing was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.” Yet it seems there must be troubles brewing for SYMC stock.

Let’s face it, Steve Bennett was only at the helm for two years and only came up with his turnaround plan in January 2013. The company has also seen other top executives leave during the past couple months, including CFO James Beer and president of products, Francis deSouza.

If anything, the Symantec CEO position has been dicey over the years. Keep in mind that the board pushed out Enrique Salem just two years ago. And he only had the job for about three years.

As for now, the replacement for Steve Bennett will be Michael Brown, a board member and the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, who will hold the Symantec CEO position on an interim basis. SYMC will then begin a search for a permanent leader. However, the process could easily take months to complete. Again, this cannot be good for SYMC stock.

For example, the company faces intense competition. There is an onslaught of cutting-edge startups that are grabbing a bigger share of the security market. They are also taking advantage of the red-hot IPO market, as seen with the hugely successful deal of FireEye (FEYE).

SYMC stock has also suffered from the lack of a clear-cut mobile strategy. For the most part, the category is a rich target for security products. But SYMC’s efforts have been lackluster. Capitalizing on the void are scrappy startups like Lookout, which have raised substantial amounts of venture capital.

Yet the biggest challenge for SYMC stock is the secular decline the traditional PC business. Consider that a large amount of sales come from antivirus software and back-up systems for the desktop. The result is that growth has stalled. During the last nine months of 2013, net revenues fell by about 2%. Yes, that’s a grueling loss as the overall security market continues to show lots of momentum and remains a high priority for enterprises, especially in light of the high-profile breaches at companies like Target (TGT).

In other words, the new Symantec CEO will have a tough job ahead. And given the company’s track record, he or she will not have much time to show results for the turnaround. Unfortunately, this pressure may make things even tougher for SYMC stock as a new leader won’t have much leeway to try new things and focus on the long-term of the business.

In other words, maybe Steve Bennett should hope the Symantec CEO position remains an interim thing.

World s###3305||PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. and European sanctions against Russia are already having a ripple effect beyond their immediate targets, with Visa and MasterCard halting payment transaction services for clients of a bank not even on the blacklist.

SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.

The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.

The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.

“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

DATE LAST MODIFIED: May 18, 2018###3307||LONDON: The world's largest money transfer company Western Union said on Friday it has suspended its services for Russia's Bank Rossiya.

In a statement, Western Union said its money transfer service continues to be available at its 20,000 plus locations and self-service terminals across Russia.

Earlier on Friday Bank Rossiya said Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had stopped providing services for payment transactions for its clients.

Bank Rossiya, which has $10 billion in assets and is used by many senior Russian government officials, was hit by U.S. sanctions imposed in response to the annexation of Crimea.###3308||DENTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As we previously stated on March 5th, our systems detected an unauthorized attempted intrusion into our Sally Beauty Supply LLC network. At the time of this discovery, we immediately engaged a top-tier forensics firm (Verizon) to investigate this security incident. As a result of this ongoing investigation, we have now discovered evidence that fewer than 25,000 records containing card-present (track 2) payment card data have been illegally accessed on our systems and we believe it may have been removed. As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation. As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.

We take this criminal activity very seriously. We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident. In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Customers are our top priority at Sally Beauty, and we will be responding to customers' needs concerning this security incident. Please check our website sallybeautyholdings.com in the coming days to learn about the progress of our work to address the security incident, the status of our investigation, and steps we will be taking to assist any affected customer. We will be providing appropriate notifications to affected consumers and others, as necessary, as the facts develop and we learn more.

SANCTIONS against allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin were ramped up by the US government yesterday, targeting 20 more individuals and one of the country’s banks.Bank Rossiya and the listed men join the US Treasury’s specially designated nationals list, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Their assets in the US will be frozen, and US citizens are “generally prohibited from dealing with them”. The list includes some of Putin’s aides, as well as Finnish national Gennady Timchenko, who runs a private investment firm called Volga group.In retaliation, the Russian government announced sanctions against a number of US citizens including senator John McCain. Moscow also shuttered a chocolate factory in Russia owned by Petro Poroshenko, a Ukrainian politician and business leader.Standard & Poor’s became the latest group to sour on Russia’s position yesterday, revising the country’s credit outlook to negative on “rising geopolitical and economic risks”, citing the potential for reduced investment and capital flight.###3316||Doh! 404!

These are not the droids you are looking for!###3317||Used games are big business for video games stores and more general retailers including Amazon and Best Buy have also got in on the action due to the potential for profit. And now another well-known name is entering the field: Walmart.

Walmart will next week launch its Video Game Trade-In program as part of its Gamecenter offering in-store. But why would you choose to trade-in at Walmart over visiting a dedicated games retailer? Because Walmart will take your games in return for a gift card, meaning you can use the cash to purchase anything in-store, online, or at Sam’s Club.

While such an offer may not be too appealing for gamers looking to buy more games, it’s certainly going to be of interest to parents, or someone looking to offload their games collection with no intention of embracing next-gen consoles just yet.

Walmart also wants to attract gamers who desire more games, though, so it’s promising to pay more for your used games while offering to sell new and used games cheaper. If they can pay more than other retailers, then Walmart will certainly do well, but we’ll have to wait until the service officially launches on March 26 to see how much better their prices are.

Although Walmart intends to start buying used games from customers from Wednesday next week, it looks like we may be waiting a while to see them reappear for sale on store shelves. A “Certified Pre-Owned” collection of games is planned, but it won’t become available until the summer. If you’re wondering what the certification means, Walmart claims each game will be refurbished and sold “like-new.”###3318||Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has had it in for Twitter ever since a stream of damaging leaks alleging widespread corruption in his inner circle spread via the social network.

Things got more restrictive back in February, as the Turkish parliament passed a bill designed to tighten control of the Internet, allowing blocks of websites deemed offensive.

On Thursday, the hammer fell, with Erdoğan promising to "wipe out Twitter," claiming "They will see the Turkish republic's strength."

As of last night, the hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey, #TurkeyblockedTwitter and #OccupyTwitter were trending worldwide.

So here's how the Turkish people can show Erdoğan a little strength of their own, and keep the tweets twittering on in the Republic.

1. Tweet through SMS

That's right: the over-zealous censors in Turkey's government haven't thought of this one. For the time being, Turkish users wondering how to access Twitter in Turkey can send tweets via their mobile network.

Twitter's Policy account tweeted last night:

Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555.

This is certainly a good option for Turkish users trying to access Twitter, but some users have voiced worries that this could lead to authorities tracking down individual users and taking action against them.

For the time being, it's probably best not to tweet anything too inflammatory using this method, as remember it will tie your Twitter handle to your phone contract and identity.

Which brings us on to...

2. Changing DNS

To the amusement of many online, the Turkish government is using a simple Domain Name System (DNS) block to black out Twitter.

DNS Blocking is a strategy for making it difficult for users to locate specific domains or web sites on the Internet. It was first introduced in 1997 as a means to block spam email from known IP addresses. Your Internet service provider (ISP) simply sees that you're trying to connect to Twitter and refuses to serve you, possibly redirecting you to another page.

The solution is simple in this case: change your DNS. There are many different options for DNS solutions, some paid-for, some free. Your best bet in our view is to use a free solution like Google DNS or OpenDNS.

Turkish users: try some of these out and let us know how much success you have!

Update: As of Saturday, the Turkish government has also blocked Google DNS. OpenDNS appears to still be working.

3. Use a VPN

Another solution is to use a VPN connection.

Setting up a VPN usually requires shelling out a little cash, however there are a number of free options.

Check out our recent list of the best free-to-use VPN providers out there.

But be careful: people should be cautious when using free VPNs. They can be unreliable, or in some cases, contain malicious software. Make sure to scan any downloaded files with leading antivirus software, and check around on forums for malware warnings before downloading anything you don't 100 per cent trust.

That's not all, though: whatever free VPN product you may consider, bear in mind that there are a few caveats. While most free VPN software employs some sort of security for the data connection, you certainly aren't getting the security strength of paid and business VPN products. So if you're doing anything that might get you in trouble, you might want to consider our final option...

Update: The most popular choice so far has been Hotspot Shield, a free VPN service that at the time of writing is being downloaded 270,000 times a day in Turkey.

4. The deep web (TOR)

That's right: the favoured haven of terrorists, drug dealers and illegal pornographers could actually be your most effective weapon in the fight against Internet censorship in Turkey.

This open source tool was born as a US Navy project, but now it's used by all kinds of people worldwide, including the hacktivist group Anonymous.

When you surf through TOR, your browser's data requests take a circuitous route through randomly-chosen TOR servers. All traffic is encrypted except the final connection from a TOR server to the actual website. Anyone intercepting a packet along the way won't learn anything about you or the destination website.

First, download the client, and then you're set!

Wal-Mart will soon be joining the likes of GameStop, Best Buy, Target and other retailers in dealing with used video games, the retail giant announced Tuesday. Starting on March 26, customers may trade in their old games for in-store and online credit at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club.

The traded games will be refurbished then sold as “Certified Pre-Owned” games at discounted prices in Wal-Mart’s approximately 3,100 U.S. stores later this year.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

The World’s Most Ethical Company designation is awarded to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to raising the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior. ING U.S. was one of 16 financial services firms and one of 144 companies overall to receive this esteemed global distinction.

“We are thrilled to be recognized with this honor. Being selected as a 2014 World’s Most Ethical Company underscores our commitment to maintaining the highest level of standards, which are essential to building and maintaining trust with our stakeholders,” said Rodney O. Martin, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, ING U.S. “These standards are part of our policies and our values, and most importantly, we practice them in the way we conduct our business every day. I am proud of our employees and the company.”

“The entire community of World’s Most Ethical Companies believes that customers, employees, investors and regulators place a high premium on trust and that ethics and good governance are key to earning it,” said Ethisphere’s Chief Executive Officer Timothy Erblich. “Honorees understand the correlation between ethics, reputation and daily interactions with their brand, and that this award truly reflects on an organization’s policies and employees. We congratulate everyone at ING U.S. for this extraordinary achievement.”

The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute’s Ethics Quotient™ framework, which was developed to assess an organization’s performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The framework and methodology was determined, vetted and refined by the Ethisphere’s network of thought leaders and from the World’s Most Ethical Company Methodology Advisory Panel. Information on each company is collected to provide a comprehensive sampling in several core competencies. Scores are generated and weighted in five categories: ethics and compliance program (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

Share This

iStock/Thinkstock(CARLSBAD, N.M.) — New air samples from a nuclear waste dump shut down because of a fire and release of radiation last month indicate new problems.

The sample shows that more radiation was released into the air on March 11 at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M. Officials say there is no expected health impact to workers, the public or the environment, but it is yet another problem for the site, which a report found has been suffering from lax safety regulations.

The man who managed WIPP, which takes in low-level nuclear waste from the nation’s weapons program, was replaced a week ago.

There is no timetable for re-opening the 15-year-old Department of Energy facility.

ISTANBUL

The number of Turkish tweets rose 33 percent after the blocking of Twitter, according to Somera.

The number of active Twitter users, as well as tweets posted, has soared since the Turkish government blocked access to the popular social media platform.Access to Twitter was blocked at 23:00 on March 20. However, according to figures published by social media rating agency Somera , over 6 million Turks tweeted from March 20, 23:00, to March 21, 12:00. Only 4.5 million tweets were sent the previous day in the same time slot, when there was no blocking. The difference corresponds to a 33 percent rise.The number of actively tweeting Turkish users has also risen by 17 percent, from 1.49 million to 1.75 million comparing the same periods. Turkish activity on Twitter had been 16 percent lower than the previous day just before the block. However, as soon as access was blocked it rose sharply, and it remained hitting record highs even at 03:00 a.m., as seen in the graph:Most users therefore seem to have got around the access ban and entered Twitter via VPN tunnels.The ban comes on the heels of damaging revelations following the corruption probe and the successive release of phone conversations of government officials, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Some observers have interpreted the decision to ban Twitter as an attempt to prevent further damaging leaks ahead of the March 30 local polls. However, Erdoğan said the government undertook such measure “for the sake of its citizens.” “I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic’s state,” he added.###3328||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###3329||Empty###3330||Empty###3331||The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

GameStop has gone a long time controlling the used games market, probably too long. Thankfully, a juggernaut is preparing to wage war.

Walmart has announced that it will be offering customers store credit for used games starting on March 26th. The announcement says the following:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, the more than 110 million gamers across the country will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition starting this summer. This is a new category for us and something our customers have been asking for.

GameStop has made a killing from used games, owing $2.4 billion in sales during the 2013 fiscal year. To put that in perspective, that's more than a quarter of its revenue stream. To say that GameStop executives consider used game sales an important part of the company would be an understatement.

The market has gone a long time without any proper competition. Walmart can be a serious player with its traffic, giving sellers a chance to turn their used games into store credit for more than one store (Walmart and Sam's Club).

Now that Best Buy, GameStop, and Walmart are competing for your used games, the days of being offered $20 for a one-week old game may soon be over.###3335||Empty###3336||Empty###3337||Empty###3338||Empty###3339||Malaysia said Sunday it had received new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for a missing Malaysian jet in the southern Indian Ocean.The transport ministry said the information had been passed on to Australian authorities coordinating the search for the plane, now focused on a remote stretch of ocean 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth.The ministry said the latest data came in the form of images but France's foreign ministry later clarified this, saying it came in the form of "satellite-generated radar echoes."A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back.According to the French statement, the debris was floating around 2,300 kilometers from Perth.The sense that the hunt was finally on the right track after more than two weeks of false leads and dead ends was reinforced by the latest satellite images.Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard.Malaysia, which later revealed the plane turned back over the Malaysian peninsula after losing contact, has enlisted 25 other countries in the search.Efforts in recent days have focused on the coast off Australia after previous satellite images of large objects there were released. Sightings of a wooden cargo pallet, along with some belts or straps, which may be linked to the passenger jet, raised hopes.The "first visual sighting" came after fresh Chinese satellite images emerged showing a large floating object in the same region around 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth.Meanwhile, two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin IL-76 planes will head toward the search area early Monday and provide relevant information for Chinese naval search vessels, Commander Liu Dianjun said Sunday.The two planes will fly from RAAF Base Pearce to Perth and will leave for the sea area in the southern Indian Ocean, where objects possibly related to MH370 were spotted by satellites. Liu said the Chinese aircraft will make a roughly eight-hour round-trip flight during their mission, with the furthest point 2,700 kilometers away from Perth.Chinese icebreaker Xuelong is expected to arrive Tuesday at the area in the southern Indian Ocean. The long-serving Antarctic research vessel is still some 1046 kilometers away from the search area, and it will take the icebreaker another 40 hours to get there.The Malaysia Airlines work team in Beijing Sunday had a 7-hour closed-door meeting with families of Chinese passengers on board. One of the relatives said that the plane was unlikely to have descended on land and the fact it disappeared from radar might be caused by the radar limitation, China News Service reported.###3340||12-sided design reprises threepenny bit as Royal Mint and Treasury say existing coin is too easy to forge

A new 12-sided pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled – and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a “giant leap into the future” the new coin will replace a familiar token that the Treasury says has a 3% forgery rate – amounting to a total of more than 45m in circulation.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the “threepenny bit”, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor the new coin – which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 – will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a “bimetallic” construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint’s headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.



A Treasury spokesman said: “After 30 years’ loyal service the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.



“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

George Osborne (@George_Osborne) Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4

“We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit.”



The Royal Mint chief executive, Adam Lawrence, hailed the “exciting project”, adding: “The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.



“It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK’s currency in the process.



“We’re extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint’s Integrated Secure Identification System (iSis) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.”



As with all British coins the Queen’s effigy will be on the “heads” side, while the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the “tails” side.



A Bank of England spokesman said: “Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”



National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: “The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.”###3341||Empty###3342||Empty###3343||Empty###3344||A $10 billion valuation would see the online home and apartment marketplace supplant both Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H). The former manages over 7,500 hotels under numerous brands including Ramada and is valued at $9.4 billion. Hyatt has a valuation of $8.4 billion.

$10 billion?

The company, in its sixth year of operation, allows people to rent out their homes, apartments, rooms or even couches with Airbnb responsible for collecting the “rent” determined by the host and taking its fees. Presently, the company has over 600,000 listings worldwide. While the company has always remained mum on revenue and profitability, in December it announced that it had facilitated 10 million guest stays with over half of that number occurring in 2013 alone.

The service has received millions of glowing reports from both renters and guests alike, but when you are responsible of 10 million guest stays there will always be exceptions. Regulators have also focused on Airbnb with concerns and investigations of safety, oversight, and tax collection.

Airbnb: Trouble in rental paradise

Airbnb has recently received quite a bit of bad press with renters finding their homes trashed with used condoms and feces and, on one occasion, having their things thrown out on the street to accommodate a planned sex party.

After complaints from hotel owners, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the company to discern whether or not a number of renters were violating a state statute that prohibits sublets of less than a month when not in the property themselves. Airbnb, rather than turning over the information, is fighting the order in court.

Despite this highly-publicized exception, both Airbnb and Uber are championing the “sharing” economy where users are able to offer a ride, a room, etc. for a fee that they set with the companies taking their cut.

The last round of funding for Airbnb was done in 2012 with a valuation of $2.5 billion. In the two years since, the company has added 160 countries to its rental service, many of which have far less regulations than the United States, and as a result has seen its valuation soar. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital have all invested in Airbnb in past rounds.

In addition to its rental fees, Airbnb is actively pursuing additional revenue streams including its own cleaning service for renters in San Francisco and New York.

“We are actively looking to build specific services,” Mr. Chesky said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in January. “We need to offer more.”###3345||Home-builder Lennar Corp. (LEN,LEN.B) posted higher first-quarter net earnings attributable to the company of $78.1 million, or $0.35 per share, which included a $45.9 million tax provision, compared with the prior-year profit figures of $57.5 million, or $0.26 per share, that included a $3.6 million tax benefit. On average, 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings per share of $0.28 for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude one-time items.

The firm clocked total revenues of $1.4 billion in the first quarter, up 38% from $990.24 million reported a year back, whereas 13 analysts estimated revenues of $1.28 billion. The company reported new orders of 4,465 homes, representing a 10% increase; and deliveries of 3,609 homes, which is up 13%.

Commenting on the results, Lennar's Chief Executive said: "Despite harsh weather conditions that impacted sales and construction during the quarter in some of our , we were able to achieve healthy year over year increases in both new orders and deliveries. Additionally, an 18% increase in average sales price and continued momentum from our land acquisition strategy drove gross and operating margin increases by over 300 basis points to 25.1% and 13.2%, respectively, the highest first quarter gross and operating margin in the Company's history."

The US has already introduced asset freezes and visa bans on high ranking Russian officials – now Visa and Mastercard have also stopped providing services to two Russian banks, St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya and SMP Bank.

Bank Rossiya, which was put under U.S. sanctions on Thursday, responded by saying it was working in a ‘stable regime’ and was taking all the necessary legal measures to defend the bank's and its clients' rights and legal interests.

US officials have singled out Bank Rossiya, Russia’s 17th largest lender, because it is the personal bank for senior Russian officials and is controlled by an associate of the president.

However, President Vladimir Putin has since vowed to keep his salary at the bank. He said it had nothing to do with the events in Crimea, and has promised to protect the institution.

‘The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them,’ the bank said in a statement.

But is there going to be widespread panic at Harrods and Harvey Nicks this lunchtime as London-based Russians go out to blow a few hundred grand on caviar and Chanel only to find they get their credit cards snipped in half?

The US has imposed sanctions over Russian individuals for their part in Russia’s seizure of Crimea on Thursday, and it has begun preparations for economic sanctions if Russia expands its footprint in Ukraine.

Moscow’s Micex index has lost more than 10% this month, wiping out billions in market capitalization.

European leaders have also added 12 people to a list of those subject to travel bans and asset freezes over the Crimea standoff.

According to Reuters, French President Francois Hollande declined to give details of the names added to the list, which was agreed among the EU's 28 leaders after six hours of talks, but said it included Russians and Crimeans and raised the total number of people subject to EU sanctions to 33.###3349||(Inserts percentage gains for China Vanke and Poly Read Estate in last paragraph)

Toyota admitted it misled American consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about two safety issues, each of which caused a type of unintended acceleration, the Justice Department said.

The settlement resolves a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities.

Toyota faces hundreds of lawsuits over acceleration problems that gained public attention after the deaths of a California highway patrolman and his family, which were reportedly caused by the unintended acceleration of his Toyota-made Lexus.

The faulty acceleration prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles, beginning in 2009.

Last year, Toyota received approval on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims from Toyota owners that the value of their cars dropped after the problems came to light. It is also negotiating with hundreds of customers who said they had been injured.

"Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said on Wednesday. "During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."###3351||Empty###3352||Empty###3353||ES News Email Enter your email address Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email cannot be used.

The £800,000-a-year French boss of British luxury handbag maker Mulberry quit today after a troubled two years in charge.

Bruno Guillon’s departure follows a series of profit warnings, a collapse in the share price and the loss of the label’s star designer. Mulberry also cancelled its show at London Fashion Week last month and instead unveiled a new collection from 21-year-old supermodel Cara Delevingne.

Fashion experts said Mr Guillon had paid the price for the failure of his strategy of taking the 43-year-old brand upmarket and ramping up prices.

He joined in March 2012 from French brand Hermès but under his leadership Mulberry lost City support, with three profit warnings in two years and a 60 per cent slump in the share price.

His decision to charge more alienated some customers. Mulberry’s flagship Alexa satchel, named after Alexa Chung, costs up to £4,500. The brand was also hit by the departure of creative director Emma Hill last June after a reported series of disagreements with her boss. She had been credited with transforming the Somerset-based business into a fashion powerhouse.

Mulberry will now be led by former chief executive Godfrey Davis, who will become executive chairman while a permanent replacement for Mr Guillon is sought. Today Mr Davis said the Frenchman had “enabled the company to increase its international appeal”.

But Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “My conviction is that Mulberry would be much better off making the most of the accessible and mid-price point handbags market.”###3354||Empty###3355||1 of 2 View Caption

NEW YORK (AP) ��Sally�Beauty says that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

The seller of beauty supplies is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm. It is also working with the U.S. Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Sally�Beauty Holdings Inc., which is based in Denton, Texas, said Monday that it will provide more information on its website in coming days, including notification of affected consumers and others.

A spate of major data breaches in recent months has raised awareness about the vulnerability of cards used in the U.S.

Recent intrusions include those at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus. The Target breach compromised 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of up to 70 million customers. At Neiman Marcus, its breach may have compromised 1.1 million debit and credit cards.

Security experts have been long pushed for increased consumer protection through so-called EMV enabled credit and debit cards, which are already common in Europe. Most cards in the U.S. still feature magnetic strips.

Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard, which seek broader acceptance of EMV technology from retailers and ATMs, said that they are creating a group intended to help the retail and banking industries come together on more-secure credit card payments. Visa and MasterCard, which run the networks that carry the payments, said the group's initial focus will be on chips embedded in newer credit cards that make them more secure.



###3357||Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed and filed for bankruptcy last month, said it had found 200,000 bitcoins that were held in an "old-format" wallet, or digital storage file.

Mt. Gox's former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement in Japanese and English on the company's website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching these wallets that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed.

Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million.

Since then, plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside of the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the bankruptcy court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site from March 14 to March 15.

The latest announcement is likely to add to the questions about Mt. Gox's collapse. Even the company said it was still uncertain about what led up to its failure.

"Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation," the company concluded in its statement dated Thursday.

Bitcoins can be stored online or offline, otherwise known as "hot" and "cold" wallets. A "cold" wallet can be nothing more than writing down a digital key to access one's bitcoin on a scrap of paper for later use, or storing data on a thumb drive.

Thieves can steal bitcoin by accessing it through a computer network, or by taking the physical storage material.

Many Bitcoin supporters have said that the collapse of Mt. Gox is part of the shake-out of the early, less sophisticated Bitcoin companies that have lost ground to newer, more well-oiled businesses.

"I think that it's yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was," said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about Bitcoin.###3358||A deepening economic standoff between Russia and the west over the future of Ukraine has rippled through trading floors and boardrooms with exporters scrambling to protect revenues and global financial firms halting services.

US President Barack Obama's threat to target major sections of the Russian economy should President Vladimir Putin follow-up his annexation of Crimea with further incursions in Ukraine has caused alarm across Europe.

Denmark's foreign ministry held a special briefing for about 130 companies, including drugs firm Novo Nordisk and brewer Carlsberg, after being inundated with inquiries about the business implications of the crisis.

In an email to Reuters, Carlsberg's chief executive said he was monitoring the situation closely and would act if sanctions had a direct impact on his drinks group's business. The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia.

"Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems," said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. "Our focus is on our employees and our breweries."

Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price.

With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the west's sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked.

"We're sending the machines specially made for Russia to Russia and we are leaving the machines that we can sell in other countries here due to the risk."

Profine, a plastic window frame manufacturer with annual revenues of €700m, has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won't be able to do that forever.

"If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners," said Peter Mrosik, the German firm's managing partner.

President Obama unveiled sanctions against members of President Putin's inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally.

In response, Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Mr Obama's list.

SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets.

Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating US sanctions on countries such as Iran.

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals.

Germany's main trade body warned that full-blown economic sanctions would be a "real catastrophe".

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany's "wise men" council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia's importance as an energy exporter.

"What has been announced so far is really nothing. It is purely cosmetic," said a French banker based in Moscow.

"The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in US dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars," said the banker, who declined to be named.

"Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically."

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home.

But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

"It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It's very difficult to predict," said another western banker in Moscow.

"I haven't heard of any western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out."

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis has soared to over $100bn.

With that figure expected to climb, western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.

Since the US and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to President Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia's state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

"We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won't annul or destroy everything we've built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented," he said on a business trip to Chile this week.###3359||"It is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation.

EUR/CHF slipped to a daily low at 1.2150 at 7:50 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.2153, down a mere 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 17th low, 1.2133, while resistance was to be encountered at March 13th high, 1.2168.

The gauge of economic sentiment for Germany probably slowed down to a reading of 51.8 in March, according to the median estimate by experts. Last month the index came in at a value of 55.7.

The index of economic sentiment for the Euro zone probably fell to 67.3 this month from 68.5 in February. The official results from the monthly survey by the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung) are to be announced at 10:00 GMT today.

Meanwhile, yesterday the annualized rate of consumer inflation in the single currency zone was reported to have weakened in February, which may put pressure on the European Central Bank to introduce new measures in order to spur economic growth.

The annualized HICP came in at 0.7% last month, a level last seen during October 2013, which was still far below central bank’s inflation objective of 2%, that provides price stability. Experts had anticipated that the annual inflation rate will remain steady at 0.8% in February.

On the other hand, safe haven demand for the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc was likely to be heightened, as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that he supported a request from Ukraine’s breakaway region of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, regardless of the imposed sanctions by the United States and the European Union.###3362||Turkey's ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections brought a furious reaction at home and abroad on Friday, with users of the social networking service denouncing the move as a "digital coup" and the president expressing his disapproval.



A court blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to "wipe out" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.



Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.



"We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon," the company said in a tweet.



A company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.



Tech-savvy Turks — President Abdullah Gul apparently among them — quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.



"One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.



Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.



Turkey's main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country's bar association filed a separate court challenge.



Twitter users called the move a "digital coup", some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.



"Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations," U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.



Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.



Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticize the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter's increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.



The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.



Telecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.



"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens," it said.



European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and "cast doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards". Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.



Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a "vital role to play in a modern democracy."



Turkey's financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.



Twitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.



Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. "We will wipe out all of these," he said. "The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is."



Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure "does not derive from a prohibitive mentality" and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling

For the three months through February 28, the business software maker earned $2.57 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $2.5 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the same quarter the year before. Excluding one-time items, the company posted an adjusted profit of 68 cents per share.

The Indiana’s unemployment rate remains below all neighboring states and is now lower than the national rate by 0.2 percent, DWD added. “Prior to the benchmarking process, the last time Indiana's rate was lower than the national rate was June of 2012.”

Even so, despite a gain of 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector, Indiana shed a total of 7,100 private sector jobs in January, “mainly due to the extreme nature of the winter season, which has been cited by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the chief causes of employment contraction throughout the country,” DWD said.

“There are many positives to note this month,” DWD Commissioner Scott Sanders said. “Indiana's unemployment rate is not only lower than our neighboring states, but the national rate as well. In addition, 2,700 Hoosiers returned to the labor force and fewer were unemployed in January than at any time since August of 2008, causing our rate to fall almost one-half of a percentage point in one month.”

Sanders also noted that Indiana's 2013 total private-sector job growth number was revised upward by 8,200 jobs to 50,800 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and that despite the extreme winter weather, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were nearly 6,000 below January 2013 levels.

Sectors showing gains in January included manufacturing (+4,600); financial activities (+1,400); and professional and business services (+200).

Sectors showing decline in January included trade, transportation and utilities (-4,900); construction (-4,300); private educational and health services (-2,100); and leisure and hospitality (-600).

Total non-farm employment decreased in January by 10,000 jobs.

(NYSE: V) and MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA) have stopped providing services to two Russian Banks. One bank, Bank Rossiya, was on the Treasury Department’s sanction list, while the other bank, SMP, was added.

SMP is owned by billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are reported to be childhood chums of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Bank Rossiya is the country’s 15th largest bank, with $12 billion in assets, and is described by U.S. officials as the personal bank for senior Russian Federation officials. SMP, with assets of around $5 billion, is among Russia’s 40 largest banks.

The actions taken by Visa and MasterCard prevent bank customers from using their cards but do not prevent those customers from accessing their cash directly at the banks. SMP’s owners have objected to the card companies’ actions, according to Reuters:

Due to the fact that the sanctions were imposed on shareholders and not on the bank, we consider the moves by the payment systems unlawful and we are confident that we can resolve the encountered difficulties in the near future.

SMP also said it has no assets in the United States.

Fitch Ratings and S&P have both warned that Russia’s credit rating may be downgraded to reflect the potential impact on the country’s economy of the sanctions. Lower sovereign debt ratings mean that the Russian government would likely be forced to pay higher interest on its borrowing.

Russia’s MICEX index fell 2.1% Friday and is down more than 10% in the month of March.###3368||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

Cramer notes Take-Two is the cheapest in the group and says CEO Strauss Zelnick has done a "remarkable job" with the company.

Cramer does not care for Wal-Mart and GameStop, and he is still waiting for new additions to its video game inventory to recharge the latter. Instead, he likes the actual gaming companies over the retailers.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates ELECTRONIC ARTS INC as a "hold" with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate ELECTRONIC ARTS INC (EA) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income and disappointing return on equity."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:



Compared to its closing price of one year ago, EA's share price has jumped by 56.86%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Although EA had significant growth over the past year, our hold rating indicates that we do not recommend additional investment in this stock at the current time.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 88.70% to $685.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -0.21%.

ELECTRONIC ARTS INC has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC increased its bottom line by earning $0.32 versus $0.21 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.31 versus $0.32).

Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Software industry and the overall market, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.

The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Software industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 584.4% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$45.00 million to -$308.00 million.

This was not an insult, however, since he is habitually late. The Russian president once made his (now deposed) Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yanukovich cool his heels for four hours while he hung out with a biker gang. In the circumstances, making some of the richest people in Russia sit around for a mere 80 minutes was practically a mark of esteem.

Putin spoke for just five minutes and did not find time to mention Ukraine, Crimea, the weakening rouble or the plunging Russian markets. Instead, he focused on a different project—“de-offshore-ization.” It is an ugly word and it sounds, if anything, even uglier in Russian, especially when Putin says it: de-offshorizatsiya. But it is one he likes, and he has been pushing it since 2008.

Story Continued Below

“Russian companies must be registered on our, on their own territory, on the territory of our country and they must have a transparent property structure. I am convinced you are also interested in this,” Putin told his crowd.

What sounds like a rather dry proposal for some changes to Russian financial regulation gained dramatic urgency just minutes later, when the White House issued sanctions against Kremlin insiders. U.S. individuals and companies were suddenly barred from doing business with some of Putin’s best friends.

The impact was immediate. Visa and Mastercard stopped servicing several Russian banks, thus blocking their clients’ ability to use ATMs. When the markets opened the next day in Moscow, shares in companies linked to people on the list plunged. Novatek, a gas company partly owned by the sanctioned Gennady Timchenko, lost 12 percent as investors piled out.

In announcing the sanctions, President Barack Obama spoke of the “costs” they would impose on Putin’s inner circle, and a senior administration official later called them “very powerful” and strongly denied they are “a mere wrist slap.”

The costs to Russia are undoubtedly severe but, as Russian businessmen scramble to get their money out of America’s reach, Putin may be secretly pleased.

Since Russia opened up in the 1990s, Russian businessmen have become adept at using the offshore banking sectors of the world to hide their wealth. In this, they are no different than Western businesses, who also park their cash places where their governments can’t get at it, but they do it on a totally different scale.

According to the most recent figures from the Russian Central Bank (for the third quarter of last year), the biggest investor in the country was Cyprus ($4.5 billion), followed by the British Virgin Islands ($2.7 billion), Luxembourg ($1.6 billion) and the isle of Jersey—all of which are generally considered to be tax havens. China, Russia’s most powerful neighbour, invested $193 million during the quarter, less than Bermuda. Germany invested $428 million, little more than half the total from the Bahamas.

This is not Bahamian money, earned by hard-working hoteliers and invested in Russia in the hope of good returns. It is Russian money, part of the vast outflow that has left the country in the last two decades, and come to rest in bank accounts around the world. Last year, $63 billion left Russia. Thanks to the post-Crimea political turbulence, financial analysts predict that 2014’s total will be double that.

This not only impoverishes Russia, it also complicates Putin’s task of bringing everything in the country within his reach—hence, his desire to de-offshore-ize it.

“The oligarchs become much more beholden to him if their money is effectively under his control. They go from being independently wealthy to ‘dependently wealthy,’” Bill Browder, who was a huge portfolio investor in Russia in Putin’s early years, but who was barred from entering the country in 2006, told me. “Going forward Putin wants them to depend on him to maintain their wealth and not have it taken away.”

Since coming to power, Putin has made it his goal to restore the Kremlin’s power: by crushing Chechnya, by cancelling elections, by controlling the media and by squashing over-mighty oligarchs who felt they could challenge him.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The £800,000-a-year French boss of British luxury handbag maker Mulberry quit today after a troubled two years in charge.

Bruno Guillon’s departure follows a series of profit warnings, a collapse in the share price and the loss of the label’s star designer. Mulberry also cancelled its show at London Fashion Week last month and instead unveiled a new collection from 21-year-old supermodel Cara Delevingne.

Fashion experts said Mr Guillon had paid the price for the failure of his strategy of taking the 43-year-old brand upmarket and ramping up prices.

He joined in March 2012 from French brand Hermès but under his leadership Mulberry lost City support, with three profit warnings in two years and a 60 per cent slump in the share price.

His decision to charge more alienated some customers. Mulberry’s flagship Alexa satchel, named after Alexa Chung, costs up to £4,500. The brand was also hit by the departure of creative director Emma Hill last June after a reported series of disagreements with her boss. She had been credited with transforming the Somerset-based business into a fashion powerhouse.

Mulberry will now be led by former chief executive Godfrey Davis, who will become executive chairman while a permanent replacement for Mr Guillon is sought. Today Mr Davis said the Frenchman had “enabled the company to increase its international appeal”.

But Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “My conviction is that Mulberry would be much better off making the most of the accessible and mid-price point handbags market.”###3385||Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to open a personal account at the Rossiya Bank to have all his salary transferred there, Interfax reports.Visa and MasterCard have refused to service the said bank as a response to Russia’s actions in Crimea.

Turkey blocked access to the social media network overnight, hours after prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the website.

Links to audio recordings and documents implicating Mr Erdogan and other top officials in corruption have been posted on Twitter ahead of crucial local elections on March 30th.

Turkey’s main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation of the ban.

The Twitter shutdown, which Turks began to notice around midnight last night, occurred 10 days before the local elections and came after Mr Erdogan lashed out at the social media site in an election rally in Bursa, a western town, on Thursday, saying he did not care about international reactions if national security was at stake.

“Twitter, mwitter! We will wipe out roots of all,” Mr Erdogan declared in a campaign speech. “They say, ‘Sir, the international community can say this, can say that.’ I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the state of the Republic of Turkey is.”

Mr Erdogan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began in December.

One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of December 17th , when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr Erdogan has repeatedly - and angrily - insisted that the recording was fake.

The prime minister’s office issued a statement before the ban was imposed, underlining what it said was Twitter’s lack of co-operation after four local courts ruled that certain content must be removed. “The presidency of telecommunication made necessary attempts in line with court rulings, however, Twitter officials have remained indifferent to these requests,” said the statement, posted on the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency.

Unless the website co-operated, the agency added, “Technically, there would be no other option than blocking access to Twitter in order to reduce damages of our citizens.”

Social media networks in Turkey have grown more popular since anti-government protests last summer, when traditional media organisations were silenced under intense government pressure and journalists critical of Mr Erdogan were either fired or forced to resign.

Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, said the company was “looking into” the ban, adding, “That’s all we have for the moment.” In Twitter messages, the company urged people to use mobile connections to get back on Twitter.

“This is certainly politically motivated prior to the local elections and the worst kind of political censorship I have seen,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a professor of cyber law at Istanbul’s Bilgi University. “Absence of Twitter from Turkey will be a significant democratic deficit.”

The government adopted further internet restrictions in February, citing the need to protect privacy. Those restrictions, which were sharply criticised by human rights groups in Turkey and abroad, allowed for the swift closure of websites or removal of Internet content by a court order in a matter of hours.

New York Times###3387||With a major corruption scandal threatening his seat at the top of Turkey’s government, and with national elections less than 10 days away, the country’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a statewide ban on Twitter late Thursday night that sent shockwaves through the country.

Telecom regulators were able to restrict user access, as issued by court order, using a simple DNS block: If a user’s IP address is on the block list, they cannot access the website or service in question. Countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have called for worldwide DNS restrictions before.

Before the ban was enforced, Erdoğan vowed to “eradicate” Twitter from the country in an election speech, apparently after the company had reportedly refused to delete incriminating audio of him instructing his son to dispose of large amounts of cash in the midst of a police investigation. News of the Twitter restriction soon rippled across the Internet, and instructions for skirting the DNS block using VPN (virtual private networks) and Google DNS–both of which change your IP address–quickly spread. Similarly, Twitter issued instructions to Turkish users on how to send tweets using SMS:

While Turkey has blocked services like YouTube before, this is the first time the government has used its authority to block a mobilizing platform like Twitter. Criticism of Erdoğan’s move to stifle the voices of Turkish citizens was swift and cutting. “The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly,” tweeted Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission. “Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.” Turkish president Abdullah Gül also chimed in, perhaps indicatively, from his Twitter account: “The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,” he tweeted.

In the hours after the social media restrictions were announced, it was reported that almost 2.5 million tweets were sent from Turkey–amounting to roughly 17,000 tweets per minute–setting a new record for Twitter use in the country.###3388||Oracle Corp posted higher third-quarter revenue and profit that failed to satisfy investors looking for signs of a sustained turnaround and its shares fell about 4 percent.

Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle’s previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals.

On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors’ targets.

Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion.

She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts’ consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said.

“They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story,” said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. “Investors need to see more. It continues to be a ‘prove me’ stock in the eyes of investors.”

The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended February 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit.

Software business still weak

Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company’s $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company’s core software business, said Ives.

Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

In response, four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc.

“They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example,” said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. “They’re playing catch up, but they’re working quickly and they’re starting to make some progress.”

On Tuesday’s call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle’s total revenue.

On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company’s salesforce last year.

“We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now,” Hurd said. “We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and … they’ve been in place longer.”

Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.

Most of Oracle’s business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.

Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.

For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.

Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.

Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Redwood City, Calif.-based IT hardware and software provider posted earnings of 68 cents a share on revenue of $9.32 billion, but Thomson Reuters analysts expected the enterprise software and computer hardware company to report earnings of 70 cents a share on revenue of $9.36 billion. Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago.

The stock price closed at $38.84, but following the report it was down about 3.3 percent at $37.55. In contrast, customer and competitor Salesforce was up 2.25 percent at $59.63 on the day.

Oracle Co-President Mark Hurd told analysts on a conference call that new software sales and Web-based subscription rose 4 percent from the same period a year ago. Revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.

Cloud App Bookings Up 60 Percent

Cloud app bookings, upon which Oracle is pinning much of its future business, saw healthy growth of more than 60 percent, Hurd said.

"Our quarterly cloud application revenue is now approaching $300 million. All of our strategic cloud application suites, including Fusion Enterprise Resource Planning, Fusion Human Capital Management and Fusion Customer Experience, posted triple-digit revenue growth," Hurd said.

Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud apps, thanks largely to "more feet on the street" after a sales reorganization in 2012 and a year of experience for new sales people.

"We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now," Hurd said. "We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer."

Sales of Oracle's hardware systems -- including commodity servers and storage and the new-gen Exadata analytics machines -- grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first uptick since the software company's $7.4 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in January 2010.

What a Couple of Analysts Said

"From my point of view, it was in line with what we expected, which wasn't rapid growth in terms of top line, but low to moderate," Gartner analyst Charles Eschinger told eWEEK. "Within the larger enterprise spaces, it was pretty consistent with what we're seeing: buyers having interest in [new] technology but perhaps holding back a little bit more than what we saw last year.

"Oracle's core products really didn't drive the growth. The real growth came from the new products: Fusion and their acquired products and then some of the [new 12C] database. That is where we're seeing more growth in terms of the industry overall and what we expected to hear and see from Oracle."

Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research wrote in a media advisory that Oracle "is not able to fully participate in the new-IT spend; its products are still considered to be for the existing IT. Large projects on Oracle are getting scaled down, large deals are taking a lot longer (30% to 50% longer) to close and new-IT players -- Amazon.com, Pivotal and VoltDB -- are putting competitive pressure on Oracle."

Still, Chowdhry wrote, "the IT spend environment is improving, and Oracle is one of the prime beneficiaries of this trend. Oracle marketing solutions are gaining traction as Oracle continues to make smart acquisitions. Oracle, along with Salesforce.com and Adobe, continue to benefit from increased spending on the marketing solutions.

"The industry is big enough and is currently not at the stage where one vendor needs to take market share from the other. Oracle, Salesforce.com and Adobe are all equally doing well with their marketing solutions offering."###3390||Empty###3391||President Barack Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That's a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won't kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group.Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin's personal banker.And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned too. Foreigners probably won't do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations, and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes, and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPOs have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits like Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries.And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia's finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.And then there's Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S., and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It's a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia's stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.Of course, there other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign, and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G-8 is another good idea.But make no mistake about it, deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.That's how difficult this job is going to be.To find out more about Lawrence Kudlow and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate web page at www.creators.com.###3392||Symantec has terminated Steve Bennett as CEO and replaced him with board member Michael Brown as president and chief exec on an interim basis.

“We recognise Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement.

“These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.”

The company also confirmed a special committee of the board will immediately commence the search for a new permanent CEO, as well as republishing its fiscal outlook previously published on January 29. Symantec’s revenue will be of $1.615 to $1.655bn, compared to $1.748bn a year ago.

Yet the CEO shuffle is grabbing the headlines. Schulman added: “Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

In other words, rearrange the following – man dead walking – and you’ve pretty much got it.

Bennett’s tenure at Symantec may be seen more sympathetically with the benefit of hindsight given his remit was to slim down and transform the company, having said when he took the helm: “I believe our assets are better than our performance and I need to understand what’s in the way.”

The company married up its MDM and MAM offerings at the Symantec Vision convention in Las Vegas back in April, with the suite also offering mobile mail client, single sign on for MAM and MAM connection security, proving the value of enterprise mobility in its portfolio.

Whoever takes over the reins at Symantec will perhaps want to go better than emulating Bennett, or the previous CEO Enrique Salem, who left in July 2012, but John W. Thompson, chief exec from 1999 and 2009 and now chairman of the board of directors at Microsoft.

The company said they had nothing further to add when Enterprise AppsTech enquired.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Oracle (ORCL) shares rose after the software, services and cloud computing giant reported third-quarter results that missed results.

For the third quarter, Oracle earned 68 cents a share on $9.3 billion, coming in below what analysts were expecting. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting 70 cents a share on $9.36 billion. The company did note in its press release that currency fluctuations impacted earnings by 3 cents a share, with 2 cents coming from the wild swings in Venezuela.

"In constant currency, our Cloud Software Subscriptions revenues grew 25% and our Engineered Systems revenue grew more than 30% in the quarter," said Oracle President and CFO Safra Catz in the press release. "Oracle Cloud Applications and Engineered Systems are both rapidly growing, billion dollar run-rate businesses. Those two high-growth businesses helped us deliver record year-to-date operating cash flow, and a record $15 billion of operating cash flow over the past twelve months."

Shares were higher in Wednesday trading, having reversed course from earlier in the session, gaining 0.12% to $38.91.



WATCH: Oracle Presents Trading Opportunity on Earnings Dip

CEO Larry Ellison lauded the company's hardware portfolio, noting Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters had over a 30% constant currency growth rate during the quarter. "Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have to."

During the company's conference call, Oracle said it expects revenue to rise between 3% and 7% during the quarter, with earnings per share expected to be between 92 cents and 99 cents. Analysts are expecting 96 cents.

Following the results and the call, analysts were largely positive on the name, noting that the cloud portfolio seems to be turning around, as the company heads into its seasonally strong fourth quarter. Here's what a few analysts had to say.

UBS analyst Brent Thill (Buy, $42 PT)

"ORCL is still searching for a breakout after 10 straight Qs of sub 5% rev growth. ORCL's three main businesses (database, apps and middleware) have been pressured by agile competitors and ORCL's late transition to the cloud, which is now well underway and is masking some of the reported growth. Now that some of these issues are being addressed more proactively by ORCL, we should start to see top line growth reaccelerate, especially as we enter ORCL's seasonally strong FQ4. $42PT."

JPMorgan analyst John DiFucci (Overweight)

"ORCL reported F3Q results that were about in line with estimates, with hardware products slightly better than expectations and software license & cloud a bit shy. We continue to believe that while ORCL is seeing secular pressure in its applications business, concerns about its most important (and most profitable) business, infrastructure software, are overblown."

Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis (Buy, $43 PT)

"For now, we will continue with our BUY rating on Oracle because the stock is sufficiently inexpensive to serve as ballast in your typical software portfolio, full of high flier money losers which can face random and rapid loss of faith by investors. That said, incrementally at least, we inched closer to a downgrade to Hold on ORCL, particularly if it appears that the firm will continue to report low end of the range results against truly easy comparisons. For now, Oracle remains a tepid BUY."

Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead (Buy, $45 PT)

"ORCL's F3Q14 numbers came in slightly below estimates, with total revs of $9.3b (+4% y/y, +6% in c/c, +4% c/c excluding acquisitions) vs. estimates of $9.36b and software license and subscription revs of $2.4b (+4% y/y, +6% in c/c) lower than expectations of $2.47b, offset by solid hardware revenues of $725m (+10% c/c and above expectations). However, the results were in-line with guidance and the mid-point of the F4Q14 revs growth guidance (of 5%) was in-line with estimates. Geographically, license sales in the Americas were up a solid 9% while Asia-Pac was down 3%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 was lower than estimates of $0.70, but was $0.71 making all FX adjustments."

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan (Buy, $44 PT)

"Cloud bookings on a 12 month basis grew 60%+ (Fusion apps grew triple digits), and 30%+ organic, including 65 seven or eight figure deals. Organic CC software revenues grew 2%+ y/y. Engineered systems grew 30%+ y/y and organic hardware revenues grew +3% CC y/y. Hardware has turned the corner and is finally growing on an organic basis, which should help accelerate the topline. Middleware grew double digits. Renewal rates hit a 4-year high. We previously noted that the 12c database product cycle is coming up (see details on pg 4). Tech license growth rates have not benefitted yet from the introduction of 12c, which should be an incrementally positive driver going forward."

Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan (Hold, $37 PT)

"ORCL's F3Q14 results were largely in line with expectations, with some puts ($0.02 currency devaluation impact) and takes (continued strong HW, lower than expected tax rate). While Cloud bookings improvement is positive, we still don't see anything in results/guidance that argues strongly for a change in our view at this point. We maintain our Hold."

MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez (Buy, $41 PT)

"We reiterate our Buy rating and $41 12-month price target following 3Q results. While software sales were a little light, we believe investors are likely to look past the quarter given accelerating cloud applications momentum, an improving hardware business and a solidly in-line 4Q outlook. We are buyers on any weakness this morning into seasonally strong 4Q and a multiyear 12c database cycle in front of us."

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin’s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 per cent in midday trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 per cent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them,” according to the Interfax news agency.

Describing Rossiya, which was rumoured to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.###3407||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

US interest rates could increase soon after the Federal Reserve hinted it is considering a change to monetary policy in the coming months.

Chair of the Fed Janet Yellen stated that interest rates could start to go up in the US as early as next year. Ms Yellen, who was the preferred candidate of president Barack Obama, took over the role from Ben Bernanke towards the end of 2013.

At a press conference, Ms Yellen said: "This is the kind of term it's hard to define. Probably means something on the order of six months, or that type of thing."

Ms Yellen made her comments to reporters shortly after it was announced that the Fed said it is going to scale back bond purchases by a further $10 billion (£6 billion) per month. This means it is now three times in a row that the central bank has tightened its stimulus efforts.

Date of rate change

Bond purchases are now expected to end later this year, which would imply rate increases will start to take place at around April 2015.

Overnight interest rates in the US were lowered by the Fed to zero per cent in December 2008, a move which was a response to the global financial crash, which damaged the US economy.

Mr Obama has overseen a recovery in the country's financial situation in the last few years, but Ms Yellen will now be looking to increase the pace of growth, while making sure it remains at a responsible and sustainable level.

In a statement released to announce its latest policy decision earlier in the month, the Fed said: "This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labour market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."

While the US looks set to increase interest rates sooner rather than later, the base rate in the UK remains at a record low of 0.5 per cent, as it has for the last five years. However, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is reported to be mulling over a rate rise in the near future.

Find up to date information on the FTSE 100 and spread betting strategies at City Index###3412||NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop’s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###3413||Empty###3414||Symatec Corp. has suddenly fired CEO Steve Bennett and temporarily replaced him with long-time board member Michael Brown.

The move came Thursday almost two months after the company reported revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 27 had dropped five per cent year-over-year.

Bennett had held the post since July, 2012.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” board chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”

But, he added, “we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than five per cent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 per cent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

The news caught the industry by surprise.

One financial analyst quoted in SiliconValley.com called it a shocker. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out,” Daniel Ives of FBR Capital markets said. “They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”

Symantec CEO talks up reorganization

In an interview this morning Gartner’s lead Symantec analyst Gene Ruth also said he was surprised at the news. In November the market research company published a positive rating on Symantec, saying things were improving at the company and that customers should continue to look at them for enterprise products. As recently as last month he spoke to Symantec officials and came away with “a good feeling.”

Ruth said he has talked to Bennett a number of times, and found his strategy of pushing Symantec to sell more solutions the right one. “Of course strategies are a wonderful thing,” Ruth added, but you have to implement them.”

Then after the firing announcement was made he spoke Thursday to chief operating officer Stephen Gillitt. There was no light shed on the reasons. In fact, he was struck that the strategy going forward is to stick to Bennett’s strategy, Ruth said, but do things faster.

Speed isn’t enough of a justification to abruptly dismiss a CEO, Ruth argues. It’s not like that board suddenly decided the company wasn’t moving fast enough. In fact, he adds, Bennett warned that the transition he planned could take several years. So he wonders if there were disagreements between the board and Bennett that aren’t being publicly aired.

17.30 (CLOSE): Blue-chip shares have fallen after US Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen warned that US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.

The guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting 10 billion US dollars (£6billion) from monthly bond purchases.

It saw the FTSE 100 Index - whose constituents are heavily exposed to the American economy - fall by 30.7 points to 6542.4.

Warning: Markets have been affected by news from America that interest rates could rise next year.

The slide followed declines last night on Wall Street but in the latest session New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average was up as it recovered some of the losses.

Stock exchanges in Europe looked untroubled, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ahead.

On currency markets, the pound held firm at 1.65 US dollars and 1.20 euros.

In London, the fall-out from the Budget was also much in evidence, particularly among gambling stocks after the Chancellor increased the tax on fixed odds betting terminals from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.

William Hill initially estimated a hit of £16million over a year but increased this figure to £22million after clarification that the hike would also apply to revenues from lower-stake terminals such as fruit machines.

Shares fell 7 per cent in the wake of the Budget announcement and were off as much as 3 per cent in the latest session, wiping up £300million from its value since Tuesday night. It pared back some of the losses later to close down 4.9p, or 1 per cent, at 346.6p.

Ladbrokes, which had also dropped sharply in the wake of the Chancellor's speech, fell by a further 6.3p, or 4 per cent, to 134.1p.

The pensions industry has also been battered after the Chancellor gave retirees the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.

The Federal Reserve head said that the US central bank would probably end its massive bond-buying programme this autumn, and could start raising interest rates around six months later.

Lee Mumford, financial sales trader at Spreadex said: ‘Equities remained sluggish this morning as investors digested Janet Yellen’s comments last night, signalling interest rates could rise by the middle of next year.



‘The turnaround comes after Philly Fed Manufacturing data showed a jump in general business conditions, coming in at 9, far higher than the 4.2 expected,’ he added.

However, global markets have fallen across the board after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.



The guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting $10billion (£6billion) from monthly bond purchases.

The message on rates sent Wall Street lower and the US dollar higher last night, and resulted in a weak session in Asia and falls in Europe this morning.

City commentators are mulling over the impact of Yellen's comments, including whether they were intentional or a slip of the tongue due to nerves at her first news conference as Fed boss.

'Fed chair Janet Yellen spooked the markets by suggesting we could see the first hike in interest rates in the middle of 2015,' said Craig Erlam of Alpari.



'Last night was a prime example of the market hearing only what it wants to hear and ignoring all of the caveats, which more often than not make the initial statement irrelevant. This mistake has been made repeatedly in the past and it appears traders have not learned from their mistakes.



'A great example of this was former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim last May that the Fed would taper [make cuts to its stimulus programme] 'later this year', adding that this was dependent on the strength of the economic data.



'In the end, the Fed did taper in December, but investors had convinced themselves that he was hinting at September, despite the economic data at the time being below par. On this occasion they chose to ignore the caveat and a lot got burned. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself next year.

'Another interesting point here is that many in the markets have assumed for a while that the first rise in interest rates could come as early as the middle of 2015, so these comments from Yellen are only in line with expectations.



'Maybe a lot of the drop in the indices, and dollar rally and gold dive for that matter, can be attributed to the growing number of FOMC members that saw rates rising to 1 per cent by the end of 2015.'



Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: 'As expected the Federal Reserve last night shaved another $10billion from their monthly asset purchase programme, but it was the press conference after the initial decision which caused markets to sell-off sharply when Janet Yellen in her first post meeting press conference as Fed chair suggested about the course of interest rates that unsettled markets somewhat.



'Assuming a continuation in the current pace of tapering the bond buying program looks likely to end in the fourth quarter, and in answer to a question about when interest rates might rise the Fed chief suggested that a rise in rates might come as early as the second quarter of 2015, much earlier than markets had expected.



'Whether she intended to be taken so literally is open to debate but it was enough to prompt a sharp reversal, and as such we can expect to see a lower open in Europe this morning.



'The Federal Reserve also dropped its unemployment threshold target of 6.5 per cent, following the example of the Bank of England, and said it would look at a wide range of factors before taking any decisions on when to move on rates.'



Hewson added: 'While the Fed may have intended to be dovish by downgrading growth forecasts for 2014, the fact that the committee are even speculating about raising rates just over 12 months out would suggest that they remain confident about the pace and nature of the economic recovery, despite concerns about the recent bad weather on the US economy.



'This marked change of tone from previous meetings saw stocks drop, bond yields rise along with the US dollar, which hit its highest level against the euro in two weeks in the space of an hour.



'If Janet Yellen had intended to make an impression in her first meeting as Fed chairwoman then she certainly succeeded yesterday, begging the question as to whether she intended to come across as hawkish as she did.'



Jonathan Sudaria of Capital Spreads said: 'Overnight at the Federal Open Market Committee press conference, after a very dovish statement, when pressed about rate hikes, Yellen spluttered out a date of possibly six months after the end of tapering.



'Blindly, everyone has calculated that with tapering at $10billion a month, six months after that would be mid 2015. However, this doesn’t tally with the tone of the words of the statement and one wonders if a bit of stage fright took hold of her in front of the glare of the cameras for the first time.



'After removing the 6.5 per cent unemployment threshold to allow loose monetary conditions to persist even longer, it wouldn’t make sense to then blind side markets with the threat of an imminent rate hike nearer than anyone had forecast. Expect regional Fed members to be doing the media circuit trying to finesse what she actually meant.'



8.55: The FTSE 100 opened down 30.9 points at 6,542.2, tracking a drop in global equities after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could raise interest rates much sooner than expected.

New central bank boss Janet Yellen sent US stocks and bonds tumbling after suggesting that interest rates could rise by mid-2015, pointing to a more aggressive push towards normalising the cost of borrowing than anticipated.

Yellen cut the Fed's bonding buying stimulus programme by a further $10billion to $55billion a month, and suggested it could be wound up entirely by this autumn.

The Fed sought to help the US recover from the financial crisis by launching a vast stimulus scheme, which generated plentiful cheap money that has boosted stock markets all over the world in recent years.

Its gradual withdrawal, which began last December, has prompted investors to pull money out of emerging markets and caused volatility across many other asset classes.

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Bruno Guillon has quit as chief executive of British luxury brand Mulberry, bringing an end to a two-year tenure marked by three profit warnings during an attempt to move upmarket that has failed to pay off.

Under Guillon, Mulberry hiked prices in an effort to become more exclusive and win back customers who were upgrading to pricier brands. But, like others in the market, it has been taken by surprise by the arrival of aspirational brands at the lower end of the luxury range, such as Michael Kors.

At the end of January, it was forced to cut profit forecasts for the third time in 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain which contributes 65 percent of sales.

“The board agreed that it was now time to part company,” a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Mulberry, which makes Bayswater and Alexa handbags that sell for up to 4,500 pounds, said Frenchman Guillon would leave immediately, without saying if he would receive any payoff.

The warning wiped over 25 percent off Mulberry’s shares in January, a loss from which they are yet to recover. Analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry’s growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

The firm’s efforts to become a global brand were also dealt a heavy blow last September when the highly-rated Emma Hill, creative director behind the Alexa and Del Rey bags, quit. Media reports suggested that Hill did not agree with the group’s strategy and she is still to be replaced.

“Given all the profit warnings at Mulberry, it was debatable how long the core shareholders would keep faith with the embattled CEO and his strategy,” analyst Nick Bubb said.

Mulberry said chairman Godfrey Davis, 64, would become executive chairman until a successor was found. During his 27 years at the group Davis has been finance chief and CEO.

Shares in the firm, which is 56 percent owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, rose 1.3 percent to 644.5p at 1028 GMT.

GROWTH STRATEGY

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to pursue more exclusive aspirations, larger rivals like Kering and LVMH, respective parents to Gucci and Louis Vuitton, have also been surprised by newcomers grabbing customers at the lower end of the market.

The likes of Michael Kors and Tory Burch, whose bags are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals, are proving increasingly popular, especially with emerging market customers - the industry’s main growth engine.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Birkin handbag maker Hermes and also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry’s share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged that value down to less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned on profits again.

On the last occasion Guillon, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, told Reuters he’d stick to his strategy. A new collection of bags was unveiled in February in collaboration with British model Cara Delevingne.

Mulberry, which still sells 60 percent of its bags for under 1,000 pounds, has focused on improving product quality and has committed to making half of its handbags in England as it seeks a higher-end position for the brand.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon “has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering” and increased the firm’s international appeal and sales overseas.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” Davis said.###3418||This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia’s southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it’s probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia’s capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."

News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.

"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.

But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don’t have -- the location of MH370."

Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).

Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.

"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.

The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.

Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."

Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.

Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.

Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.

Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association told The Associated Press.

"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.

The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.

Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane’s pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.

The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10 billion would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39 billion.###3422||Empty###3423||Goshen, IN (46526)

The mega-retailer is now accepting trade-ins on used games at its stores, allowing you to turn your old copies of "Call of Duty" and "Halo" into gift cards to be used online or at any Walmart or Sam's Club location.

The program, launching Mar. 26, will allow shoppers to trade in games "for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360." Once a game is brought in, Walmart will scan the UPC, check the disk for any damage and provide a trade-in value based on the game's condition.

All used games will be refurbished and sold in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition later this year.

"There are almost a billion video games sitting unused in homes across the United States," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment for Walmart.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," he continued in a blog post.

Walmart's new trade-in initiative will debut at more than 3,100 locations throughout the United States. The retailer has yet to list any specific trade-in values for popular games like "Titanfall" and "Dark Souls II," so we'll have to wait and see how Walmart's prices stack up to those of Best Buy and Gamestop.

This isn't Walmart's first foray into the world of exchanging electronics, as the store accepts trade-ins on smartphones, tablets and MP3 players.

The case is important not because of the particular reversal, since the public obviously doesn’t want people punished for possessing small amounts of marijuana. Nor is the decision likely to clog the courts with thousands of demands for reversals, since the defendant’s case was unusual in that it was on appeal when Amendment 64 was approved.

But the retroactive application of the amendment is disturbing — and it’s good to see state Attorney General John Suthers saying he’s going to appeal the ruling.

As the court itself noted, “when construing a constitutional amendment, unless its terms clearly show intent that the amendment be retroactively applied, ‘we presume the amendment has prospective application only.’ ” Amendment 64 had no retroactive provision. But the court reasoned that state statute and doctrine established by the Supreme Court allow “a defendant to benefit retroactively from a significant change in the law.” And there’s no doubt Amendment 64 changed law.

Suthers counters that “well-established retroactivity law in Colorado indicates that statutory changes are prospective only unless the General Assembly or the voters have clearly indicated” otherwise.

And he worries about “the implications this ruling may have on other non-marijuana cases.”

Indeed, lawmakers could become reluctant to make major adjustments in the criminal code if they will have a cascading effect on those previously convicted.

By the way, the actual prosecution of the defendant, Brandi Jessica Russell, was hardly a miscarriage of justice. She tested for amphetamine, marijuana and methamphetamine after she and her husband took an injured baby to the hospital and the doctor grew suspicious. And the appeals court did uphold her conviction on possession of meth.###3432||Empty###3433||Mulberry's chief executive has left the luxury handbags firm after two years at the helm.

The departure of Bruno Guillon, who joined the Somerset-based company from Hermes in 2012, comes two months after a major profits warning.

He will be replaced on an interim basis by former boss Godfrey Davis, who oversaw the rapid growth of the Mulberry brand between 2002 and 2012.

Mr Davis, who will revert back to his old role of executive chairman until a successor is found, said Mr Guillon had improved the quality of the Mulberry offering and increased its appeal in international markets.

He added: "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The company issued a profits warning within months of Mr Guillon's appointment in March 2012 and in June last year announced that creative director Emma Hill was to leave the luxury handbag maker.

Following her appointment in 2008, Ms Hill was credited with turning the firm from a trusted briefcase and wallet maker into an international fashion powerhouse with a clutch of celebrity fans.

The company's best known product of recent times has been the Alexa bag - inspired by style icon Alexa Chung - while its Del Rey bag was inspired by American artist Lana Del Rey.

Mr Guillon said last year that after three years of rapid growth he was laying the foundations for turning Mulberry into a global luxury brand.

He pointed out that with over 80% of sales derived from markets where the economic climate remains difficult, Mulberry's challenge was to accelerate its brand awareness in the United States and Asia.

However its recent warning left Mulberry on course for another year of falling profits, having slumped by more than a quarter in the 12 months to last March.

Mr Guillon was previously managing director of Hermes France, a position he held for four years. He joined Hermes in 2001, having previously worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci.

Russell Crowe, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood are among the celebs to tweet their objections to the Turkish government’s crackdown on the social media messaging service.

“Turkey has banned Twitter? That is a terrible decision. I don’t understand it,” Crowe tweeted.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blocked access to Twitter and vowed to “eradicate” it after recordings implicating him in a bribery scandal flooded social media. Erdogan’s Twitter smackdown sparked outrage around the globe, with #TwitterisblockedinTurkey blowing up.

“Is Twitter genuinely blocked in Turkey? If so, this is shameful and scary,” tweeted Wood.

Meanwhile, Farrow spread news of a way around the ban: “Hey there friends in Turkey! You can stay on twitter via VPN and Hotspot.”

Erdogan, who is trying to quell the corruption scandal ahead of key local elections, blew off condemnation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other countries.

“The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,” he said.

Turkey’s Internet watchdog has blocked access to YouTube in the past, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which was used to spark government protests last year.

Some users have figured out how to circumvent the ban using the site’s SMS service. On Friday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan’s, was among those to defy the ban.###3435||Colorado legislative economists on Tuesday predicted that recreational marijuana taxes will bring in only half of what Gov. John Hickenlooper expects they will.

A forecast produced by economists at the nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects taxes on recreational marijuana will generate about $65 million in the fiscal year beginning in July. Hickenlooper’s projection, released last month, expects nearly twice that — $125 million.

The new prediction further adds to the debate over how lucrative first-in-the-nation taxes on recreational marijuana will be for the state’s coffers. In January, tax revenue came in on pace to be far below previous predictions for the last six months of the current fiscal year.

But Legislative Council economist Larson Silbaugh told members of the legislature’s Joint Budget Committee on Tuesday that too many variables — from the low number of stores open, to the high interest in history-making marijuana purchases — make the January numbers unreliable predictors of what’s to come.

“You can basically use that January number to justify any forecast you want,” he said.

Instead, Silbaugh said Legislative Council economists are more pessimistic than the governor’s economists about how many people will stay in the recreational marijuana market long-term. Recreational marijuana costs about 20 percent more than medical marijuana, he said. And that’s before the hefty taxes on recreational marijuana are applied.

Silbaugh said legislative economists believe many people will decide it is more cost-effective to remain medical-marijuana patients. While such patients must pay up front for a doctor’s evaluation and a state registration fee, medical-marijuana purchases are subject only to the state’s general 2.9 percent sales tax.

“We’re not expecting a lot of new marijuana users because of retail marijuana,” Silbaugh said. “And we’re not expecting because of the price differential, many medical marijuana users shifting over to the adult use market.”

For that reason, legislative economists predict Colorado marijuana stores will do more than $750 million in recreational and medical marijuana sales in the coming fiscal year. Hickenlooper’s economists have put that figure at nearly $1 billion.

However much recreational marijuana taxes generate, Hickenlooper has proposed using all of the money to deal with issues related to marijuana legalization — including funding drug treatment and youth drug-use preventions. Lawmakers are considering the proposal.

John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold###3436||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- GameStop (GME) was falling 4.8% to $37.84 at 9:53 a.m. on Tuesday amid reports that Wal-Mart (WMT) would restart its video game trade-in business.

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday that the program would begin on Wednesday, March 26. The retail giant said customers can trade in old video games in exchange for gift cards applicable towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, both in stores or online. The program will be available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores in the U.S. and will accept games from the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft (MSFT) XBox 360.

The move could prove extremely problematic for GameStop, which uses a trade-in program as a key part of its business strategy in its nearly 6,500 stores. The company reported in its third-quarter results in January that pre-owned sales increased 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, which accounted for 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also expects gross margins for the pre-owned category in the range of 46% to 49% for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year.

TheStreet Ratings team rates GAMESTOP CORP as a "buy" with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate GAMESTOP CORP (GME) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, reasonable valuation levels, good cash flow from operations and compelling growth in net income. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 7.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 18.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

Powered by its strong earnings growth of 111.41% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 44.71% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, GME should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Specialty Retail industry. The net income increased by 111.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from -$624.30 million to $68.60 million.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 80.29% to $680.60 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, GAMESTOP CORP has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -19.02%.

The bike share program’s survival depends on its appeal to tourist and expansion to new neighborhoods. Citi Bike leaders have reached out to officials in the de Blasio administration to that effect, pushing for a lift in the rates charged for the blue bikes’ use.

Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, told the Wall Street Journal that Citi Bike faces “a number of financial and operational challenges,” the details of which she did not specify. “We are working as diligently as we can to help the company resolve them and strengthen the program going forward,” she said before the City Council’s transportation committee in a March 6 meeting.

Among Citi Bike’s recent issues are equipment damage sustained during Superstorm Sandy, software glitches, a frigid 2013-14 winter that hurt ridership and a greater popularity with annual users than daily or hourly ones. Those long-term riders generate less revenue with the $95 per year plus tax that they pay to use the bikes than those who purchase a 24-hour pass, which costs $9.95 plus tax, or a $25-plus-tax seven-day pass.

The bike share program has also had to contend with lawsuits from a number of New York City residential buildings, which aimed to remove stations from in front of Petrosino Square, 99 Bank Street and Cambridge House at 175 West 13th Street. A suit regarding the station in front of the Plaza hotel remains in limbo.

Others in the real estate industry, however, have embraced bike share stations as a building amenity. Brokerage aptsandlofts.com added a function to its website showing listings’ distance from the nearest station in June of 2013.

Application may not work as expected.###3441||Empty###3442||Washington has seriously upped the ante on Vladimir Putin by slapping sanctions on some of his most powerful allies.

Now on the U.S. blacklist are Kremlin banker Yuri Kovalchuk and his Bank Rossiya, major oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and at the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin’s chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief. Most have deep ties with Putin and have grown rich during his time in power.

The EU has predictably acted more cautiously, adding a further 12 names to the list of Russian and Crimean officials already hit with travel bans and asset freezes, cancelling an EU-Russia summit and starting preparatory work on broader financial and trade sanctions – “stage 3” which Angela Merkel said would be triggered if Putin escalated the crisis any further.

The dozen new names will be published today.

Russia’s retaliatory sanctions so far look thin – banning senior U.S. politicians from travelling there, which was greeted with derision by the likes of John Boehner and John McCain. But there could be more to follow which will hurt Europe, with its deep economic and trade ties with Russia.

The working assumption remains that it would cost Moscow too much to curb or cut off its gas supplies to the EU. It supplies a third of Europe’s gas and more than a fifth of its oil but the EU has hefty reserves after a mild winter.

The other presumption is that while Europe will not go to the wall over Crimea, any Russian intervention in the east of Ukraine would demand a more robust, though not military, response from there and Washington. But no one really knows how Putin will react next.

If any reminder of the cost was needed, Russian stocks have fallen nearly three percent this morning and last night Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on Russia’s credit rating to negative from stable. It expects further sanctions to be imposed.

Bank Rossiya has said it is working as normal today though Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing payment transactions services for its clients.

The EU plans to sign an “association agreement” with Ukraine today, promising closer political and trade ties that will help draw it more closely into Europe and boost its economic growth. This is another way of hurting Russia.

By luring the rump of Ukraine towards the west and priming it with funds, it could be lost to Russia forever, dealing a fatal blow to Putin’s plan for a Eurasian trading bloc. For Kiev’s part, it may have to adopt an ostensibly neutral stance between east and west to avoid provoking Moscow further.

Brussels is giving Ukraine unfettered access to the 28-nation bloc’s 500 million consumers even before a proposed bilateral free-trade accord comes into force later this year. And it has also brought forward plans to finalise agreements with Moldova and Georgia, signing them by June at the latest.

An IMF team in Kiev has extended its work on an aid package until Tuesday, saying good progress had been made.

The U.S. and EU would row in behind an IMF package, helping Ukraine meet its debt obligations and begin the process of rebuilding. A meeting of G7 leaders in the Hague on Monday could be pivotal in that regard.

EU minds have also been focused on reducing their dependence on Russian energy which would eventually leave Moscow nowhere to look but east. Longer-term, that means boosting “indigenous supplies”, which include renewable energy and shale gas, exploring how much U.S. gas could be shipped to Europe and before that looking to the Gulf for LNG.

EU sources said the leaders agreed to accelerate work to upgrade cross-border energy networks to reduce individual member states’ vulnerability to supply cuts, and speed up building new liquefied natural gas import terminals to diversify suppliers.

Elsewhere, Rome is poised to announce a new issue of its popular BTP Italia bond. The retail bond aimed at ordinary Italians set a

European record by raising 22.3 billion euros at the last sale in November. It has also attracted institutional buyers.

S&P has affirmed Greece’s rating at B-, deep in junk territory, with a stable outlook, saying its economy is gradually rebalancing. It said it could raise the rating if growth were to pick up more substantially. The agency is also due to run the rule over Nigeria.###3443||Empty###3444||Empty###3445||Copyright 2018 Zacks Investment Research

The new mayor told reporters today that the city’s bike-share program, reportedly bleeding money, will probably not be getting any public dollars to help fill its coffers.

“At this moment, that’s not in our plans,” said Mr. de Blasio, responding to a question about whether the city would aid the privately-financed program at an unrelated press conference today. “We want to see what we can do help them back on their feet using other methodologies.”

Despite their popularity in some neighborhoods and their ballyhooed–if delayed–roll-out under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Citi Bike continues to lose money, according to today’s Wall Street Journal. The report cited poor weather, rising operational costs, damage to equipment during Hurricane Sandy and unexpectedly low usage by tourists as reasons for the bike share’s financial struggles.

Unlike bike-share programs in other cities, Citi Bike receives no public money. All revenue is raised through membership fees, corporate sponsorships and advertising. Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, has left the door open to a possible price hike, but is in discussions with the company about other options.

“What Commissioner Trottenberg was doing is sitting down with the folks from Citi Bike and saying, ‘What would help in terms of the way things are structured now, what would help you financially, with all the other possibilities that may be there?” Mr. de Blasio said. “We’re open to any proposal they have. Again, at this moment, city budget money is not on the table but we’re open to other alternatives.”

The mayor, when pressed, further said he would be open to state or federal funding to keep the bikes running.

“If we can find that, that certainly would be great,” he said. “But the point is I think it’s a valuable service, it’s proven to be a success, we want to see it continue, we want to see it expand and we’re going to work with them to find alternatives.”###3447||The Japanese automaker last year paid more than $1 billion to resolve economic-loss claims related to the recall.

The U.S. Justice Department has reached a $1 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corporation over the automaker's handling of consumer complaints tied to unintended vehicle acceleration and will announce the agreement as early as Wednesday, CNN reported.

Sources familiar with the deal told CNN that Toyota Motor Corporation was expected to avoid criminal charges.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###3450||Empty###3451||Putin Pledges Supports For Sanctions-Hit Lender To Energy Sector

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged his support on Friday for Bank Rossiya, a lender hit by U.S. sanctions which mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.

The bank and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is also one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

"Our companies will continue using the services of the bank," a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following the sanctions.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, instructed the Russian central bank to aid Bank Rossiya, if needed.

"And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand it is a medium-sized bank," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday."

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

The Russian central bank said the measures imposed by the United States would have no significant impact on the financial stability of Bank Rossiya.

"If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors," it said in a statement.

St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, the country's 15th largest in terms of assets, is chaired by Kovalchuk, a close adviser to the president. The friendship between the two men dates back to the early 1990s.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

Wal-Mart announced yesterday that it will begin accepting video game trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

Wal-Mart says it wants to “shake up” the secondhand market and steal some of the increasingly dwindling market-share from competitors like GameStop.

So why trade games in at Wally-World as opposed to GameStop or Best Buy? Wal-Mart executive Mac Naughton says that traded-in games will get in-store credit that can be used on anything in the store. Including, but not limited to, bags of chips, fly threads and boogie boards, as an example.

Mr. Naughton went on to explain that the other big difference between Wal-Mart and other trade-in opportunities is that the store will “pay more than anybody else” for old games. While prices vary he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.

Here's how the program works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

[via GameSpot]###3454||PERTH/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The search area for a missing Malaysian jetliner in remote seas off Australia was widened on Monday after French satellite images revealed potential “floating debris” several hundred kilometres north of pictures previously captured by U.S. and Chinese satellites.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the new lead in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was promising, but cautioned that the search in the icy southern Indian Ocean remained difficult.

“It’s a lot of water to look for just perhaps a tiny object,” Truss told ABC Radio. “Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and the forecast ahead is not that good so it’s going to be a challenge, but we will stick at it.”

Truss said the object spotted by a French satellite, which was reported to Malaysia on Sunday, was 850 km (528 miles) north of the current search areas for the Boeing 777 that vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board.

“That’s not in the area that had been identified as the most likely place where the aircraft had entered the sea,” Truss said.

Australia had used a U.S. satellite image of two floating objects to frame a search area some 2,500 km (1,430 miles) southwest of Perth.

Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing. Most of the passengers were Chinese.

A total of 10 planes, including Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 and Japanese P-3C aircraft joining the search for the first time, are due to sweep a 68,000 sq km area on Monday.

The crews are zeroing in on the areas around where the earlier sightings were made in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris, including a wooden pallet, spotted by a search plane on Saturday.

China said the object it had seen on the satellite image was 22 metres long (74ft) and 13 metres (43ft) wide.

It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same as those detected by Australia, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, said a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search.

The wing of a Boeing 777-200ER is approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base, according to estimates derived from publicly available scale drawings. Its fuselage is 63.7 metres long by 6.2 metres wide.

NASA INVOLVED

NASA said it would use high-resolution cameras aboard satellites and the International Space Station to look for possible crash sites in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. space agency is also mining archived images collected by instruments on its Terra and Aqua environmental satellites, said NASA spokesman Allard Beutel.

The Commanding Officer of the Australian Navy ship HMAS Success Captain Allison Norris RAN stands on the ship's bridge after it arrived in the search area for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in this picture released by the Australian Defence Force on March 23, 2014. REUTERS/Australian Defence Force

“Our satellites and space-based cameras are designed for long-term scientific data gathering and Earth observation. They’re really not meant to look for a missing aircraft, and obviously NASA isn’t a lead agency in this effort. But we’re trying to support the search, if possible,” Beutel said.

Truss said the aircraft flying on Monday would be focused on searching by sight, rather than radar, which can be tricky to use because of the high seas and wind in the area. Civil aircraft, which can carry more people, have joined the search.

Truss warned that the search could be hampered further by a cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.

“Clearly it won’t be cyclonic when it gets down into the southern waters where we are dealing with this search, but certainly it could stir up less favourable weather ... and looking visibly for debris or anything of interest is the best chance of success,” he said.

HIJACK OR SABOTAGE?

Investigators believe someone on the flight shut off the plane’s communications systems, and partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and re-crossing the Malay Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

That has led them to focus on hijacking or sabotage, but investigators have not ruled out technical problems. Faint electronic “pings” detected by a commercial satellite suggested it flew for another six hours or so, but could do no better than place its final signal on one of two vast arcs.

The lack of solid news has meant a prolonged and harrowing wait for families of the passengers, who have complained both in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur about the absence of information, many breaking down with grief.

A Malaysian statement said a “high-level” team briefed relatives in Beijing on Sunday in a meeting that lasted more than six hours.

While the southern arc is now the main focus of the search, Malaysia says efforts will continue in both corridors until confirmed debris is found.

“We still don’t even know for certain if the aircraft is in this area,” Truss said of the southern Indian Ocean search. “We’re just clutching at whatever little piece of information that comes along to try to find the place we can concentrate the efforts.”###3455||Empty###3456||Empty###3457||Empty###3458||Empty###3459||Empty###3460||Last Updated: 19 Mar 2014

The current circular £1 coin has become an easy target for forgers and will be replaced by a 12-sided version, chancellor George Osborne will say in the Budget today.

Introduced from 2017, the new pound coin will be the same shape as the 'threepenny bit' which went out of use in 1971. The Treasury says it will save taxpayers money by cutting down on fraud -the Royal Mint estimates there are about 45 million fake £1 coins in circulation.

'The current £1 coin design is now more than thirty years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time,' said Adam Lawrence, Chief Executive of The Royal Mint.

The new £1 coin will still have the queen's head on one side, and there will be a public competition to design the 'tails' side of the coin.

The 12-sided version will be constructed from two different coloured metals and contain an iSIS security feature - a new high security coinage currency system developed by The Royal Mint.

However, the new coin is estimated to cost £20m to introduce, Andrew Mills, director of circulation for the Royal Mint, told BBC Radio 4 this morning.

This is mainly due to the fact that the new coins will need to be accepted in supermarket trolleys, parking meters and vending machines, he said. 'We want to make the transition as smooth as possible'.

Last year the Bank of England announced the UK will switch to plastic pound notes from 2016, ending 320 years of paper money.

The new 'polymer' notes will start with a new £5 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016 and the Jane Austen £10 a year later.###3461||Further updated France has used a space based radar system to pierce the clouds frustrating the Australian coordinated search for flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean and found evidence of substantial debris which may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines 777.

Further updated

France has used a space based radar system to pierce the clouds frustrating the Australian coordinated search for flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean and found evidence of substantial debris which may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines 777.

In an interview carried on the US ABC network and a Kuala Lumpur news site French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal says the seldom discussed satellite radar system “identified some debris that could be from the Malaysian Airlines plane”.

He said the radar echoes, which can be converted into black-and-white images, do not have the same “definition like a photograph, but they do allow us to identify the nature of an object and to localize it.”

Such space based radar sounding systems are rarely acknowledged by the world’s space powers in public discussions, with their capabilities and technologies referred to in little more than generalities.

However France’s use of the space radar, and its sharing of the southern ocean data with the MH370 search effort, brings an important new capability to bear in the zone between 2300-2600 kilometres SW of Perth where a range of objects which may be from the lost Boeing 777-200ER are being sought.

These include briefly glimpsed coloured restraining tapes floating in the vicinity of a wooden pallet which may have been used to secure cargo loaded in the belly of the Malaysia Airlines flight. Flight MH370 had 239 people on board when it took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on 8 March, only to disappear from air traffic control radar 42 minutes after departure.

Satellite radar soundings could penetrate the bad visibility that frustrated yesterday’s attempts by aircraft and ships to locate one or perhaps more large objects already seen at optical wavelengths by an American and a Chinese satellite on 16 March and 18 March respectively.

A late night update issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority says nothing new was found by air or sea in the search area yesterday Sunday, which despite earlier hopes for improved visibility, saw viewing conditions deteriorate and frustrate searchers. The statement didn’t refer to the new French satellite data which the authorities in KL said was sent to AMSA yesterday. There would be a very good reason for not referring to it should it involve disclosures about sensitive space systems capabilities.

Today’s search activities will have additional aircraft from China and Japan available for the first time, and the targets for aircraft and vessels will be refined using data from buoys dropped yesterday and the previous day to give real time information on wind and ocean current and wave conditions.

Update

In a radio interview this morning the Transport and Infrastructure Minister Warren Truss confirmed French reports that the objects identified by space radar are some 800 kilometres or so north of the areas where US and China satellite images found a large object last week, and where transient sightings were made in bad visibility of a wooden pallet and some cargo straps over the weekend.

(Visited 11 times, 1 visits today)###3462||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- You only get so long to perform a turnaround. Steve Bennett -- who was replaced as the CEO of the computer security software company Symantec (SYMC) on Thursday -- probably thinks that 20 months was not long enough. But the company's board were not convinced. As they wrote in a statement that was released after the market close Thursday:

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

When Bennett joined Symantec, its shares were below $15. During his tenure as CEO, the stock rallied as high as $27, as investors initially agreed with his efforts to streamline and reorganize Symantec's product range -- including Norton anti-virus software -- as well as to cut costs. The last two quarterly corporate disclosures, though, have disappointed the market. This appears, at first glance, to have had some influence.

So what should investors think?

The shares are down today to levels last seen over a year ago. As of 11:30 a.m., they're trading at $18.02, down 13.8% for the day. Year to date, the stock is down 23.4%.

Yet the cyber security sector appears to be as attractive as ever. Businesses and consumers, on both their networks and electronic devices, only have a greater need for security over time. That's why companies like Check Point Software (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have had such strong stock prices recently.

Clearly, though, something is not right with Symantec. Accompanying the disappointing recent quarterly results have been a series of resignations (and appointments) to the management team.

My instinct is that Steve Bennett's desire -- as expressed in the last quarterly results conference call in January -- to "continue to drive improved efficiency and better resource allocation across the company" has upset too many of the company's employees. The approach likely lost the support of the other board members. Combine this with a poor last couple of quarters, and this led to yesterday's end to his CEO tenure.

But Symantec still has a lot going for it. Despite all its recent troubles, Symantec still has strong brands like Norton. It continues to generate free cash. Plus, at the current share price, it has a dividend yield of nearly 3%. It has more than $700 million of outstanding share buyback capability and has net cash on the balance sheet of well over $1 billion. That's significant for a company with a market capitalization of under $13 billion. That will have caught the eye of other companies, including those in private equity.

Longer-term technology sector watchers may remember that Intel (INTC) purchased Symantec's peer McAfee a few years ago.

Given the importance of cyber security to both businesses and individuals, Symantec's troubles and weak share price present a prime time for investors to do their due diligence. It's time to act. Embrace the volatility and consider Symantec shares now, when they're on sale.

(NYSE: WMT) must believe that it actually is the dominant force in everyday low prices. It means to prove that point by offering customers the prices that its competitors charge. While the program has its risks, it may also prove the no other retailer can match the bulk of its discounts.

According to a report:

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form a store credit. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

Customers register online, and then put in the tag number of their receipts into a database which spiders prices from advertising posted by Walmart’s competitors. Clothing and electronics products will not be part of the program. However, the matching system will work by market, so customers actually have a practical means of using the program

Of course, “Savings Catcher” could trigger price wars — and drive down the profits of any retail which wishes to use discounts to draw customers. Walmart has the advantage of its balance sheet and low cost of doing business. It is among the U.S. companies which pays its employees the least.

Walmart has good reason to take the risk. Same store-sales and revenue in the United States have stagnated. It also has had trouble openings stores in the nation’s largest cities, where there is political pressure from smaller retailers to keep Walmart out. Its stock price has been stuck in a range of $70 to $81 for about a year. The stock closed Friday at $76.10 but is down 3.3% this year.

Walmart has taken a chance with “Savings Catcher.” However, it does not have many other means to improve its embattled store sales.###3464||In an echo of the Cold War, MasterCard and Visa have stopped processing payments by some Russian banks after the United States issued sanctions over Russia's recent annexation of Crimea.

Reps from Visa could not be reached for comment. RT reports that Visa has also cut off SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank; both credit card companies are no longer working with Rossiya Bank.

By Neil Maidment and Kate Holton

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Bruno Guillon has quit as chief executive of British luxury brand Mulberry, bringing an end to a two-year tenure marked by three profit warnings during an attempt to move upmarket that has failed to pay off.

Under Guillon, Mulberry hiked prices in an effort to become more exclusive and win back customers who were upgrading to pricier brands. But, like others in the market, it has been taken by surprise by the arrival of aspirational brands at the lower end of the luxury range, such as Michael Kors.

At the end of January, it was forced to cut profit forecasts for the third time in 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain which contributes 65 percent of sales.

“The board agreed that it was now time to part company,” a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Mulberry, which makes Bayswater and Alexa handbags that sell for up to 4,500 pounds, said Frenchman Guillon would leave immediately, without saying if he would receive any payoff.

The warning wiped over 25 percent off Mulberry’s shares in January, a loss from which they are yet to recover. Analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry’s growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

The firm’s efforts to become a global brand were also dealt a heavy blow last September when the highly-rated Emma Hill, creative director behind the Alexa and Del Rey bags, quit. Media reports suggested that Hill did not agree with the group’s strategy and she is still to be replaced.

“Given all the profit warnings at Mulberry, it was debatable how long the core shareholders would keep faith with the embattled CEO and his strategy,” analyst Nick Bubb said.

Mulberry said chairman Godfrey Davis, 64, would become executive chairman until a successor was found. During his 27 years at the group Davis has been finance chief and CEO.

Shares in the firm, which is 56 percent owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, rose 1.3 percent to 644.5p at 1028 GMT.

GROWTH STRATEGY

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to pursue more exclusive aspirations, larger rivals like Kering and LVMH, respective parents to Gucci and Louis Vuitton, have also been surprised by newcomers grabbing customers at the lower end of the market.

The likes of Michael Kors and Tory Burch, whose bags are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals, are proving increasingly popular, especially with emerging market customers - the industry’s main growth engine.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Birkin handbag maker Hermes and also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry’s share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged that value down to less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned on profits again.

On the last occasion Guillon, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, told Reuters he’d stick to his strategy. A new collection of bags was unveiled in February in collaboration with British model Cara Delevingne.

Mulberry, which still sells 60 percent of its bags for under 1,000 pounds, has focused on improving product quality and has committed to making half of its handbags in England as it seeks a higher-end position for the brand.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon “has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering” and increased the firm’s international appeal and sales overseas.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” Davis said.###3467||Empty###3468||Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is in a bit of a quandry. Last month CEO Mark Karpeles reported 850,000 Bitcoins missing, where Bitcoins were mysteriously moved to online wallets and then to offline wallets where they disappeared, but some has been found. Mt. Gox revealed today that they found an old online wallet that hadn't been used since 2011 and still had some change in it. The company announced in Japan that it found 200,000 Bitcoins in said wallet, which is worth just over $115 million at this morning's exchange rate.

There's still a ton missing and a lot of people lost money on the now-closed company, but it's something.

Of course, no one knows exactly what happened to all that money- was it straight theft? Why did the company keep trading long after it had knowledge of the theft? Was it outside forces or someone within?

Whatever the case stories like this don't help the new currency's reputation, especially when compounded of stories about suicides, a mysterious creator who may or may not have been finally revealed, and a rapidly fluctuating exchange rate. Still, Bitcoin remains popular, as does Bitcin mining, the process by which new Bitcoins are created by utilizing your computer's power.

It did fall under $600 for the first time yesterday, but it's been pretty stable around $600 for months. We'll see if the price drops any further- you can bet the thousands of people with money on the line will be doing so as well.###3469||Empty###3470||Empty###3471||Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added. The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are continuing and may still fall apart, these people cautioned. Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $US170 billion — paid more than $US16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged,” said Colin Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out.”

Others view the valuation race more skeptically. “We’re seeing valuations go nuts,” said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.

Under the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations. Those potential hurdles have failed to daunt prospective investors. TPG Growth, for example, participated in a fund-raising round for Uber last year that valued the service at $3.8 billion.



Investors are betting that Airbnb will continue to show enormous growth. Its last fund-raising round, in 2012, valued the company at $US2.5 billion. Should its latest efforts to raise capital succeed, it will carry a higher valuation than Wyndham Worldwide, whose market capitalisation stands at $US9.3 billion, or Hyatt, whose market value is $8.4 billion.

The round would also put a valuation on Airbnb more than twice that of HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation rental company that carried a value of $US3.8 billion as of Thursday. Airbnb’s current investor roll reads like a list of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital firms. Among them: Sequoia Capital, the only outside investor in WhatsApp; Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer of Facebook; Founders Fund; and even the actor Ashton Kutcher.

London - British luxury handbag maker Mulberry on Thursday announced the departure of its chief executive, Frenchman Bruno Guillon, with immediate effect after two years at the helm. The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Davis said in a short statement.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” he added.

The Tokyo-based company has not yet explained how the huge amount of bitcoins, currently valued at about $120 million had moved to “old format” wallets. The company said only that the bitcoins were found in an old-format wallet which it thought no longer held any bitcoins. With the discovery, the number of bitcoins missing from the exchange comes down from 850,000 to 650,000.

Mt. Gox was not supervised by local regulations in Japan and thus user’s deposits were uninsured by government entities. Following news of the controversy, in U.S., District Judge Gary Feinerman had frozen the assets belonging to Mt. Gox, but later loosened his restraint on March 11 to allow movement of small amounts of the digital crypto-currency.

The records and offline wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings, the company said in a statement posted on its website. It said the bitcoins rediscovered now had been moved to its offline wallets. Though it did not specify the nature of the offline wallets, normally USB sticks and paper documents are used as such.

The statement mentioned further, “For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC which were at first on the 7th moved to online wallets, were moved between the 14th and 15th to offline wallets. These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels.”

When the company filed for bankruptcy protection it said that nearly all of its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, and said the most likely reason was theft. Out of the 850,000 bitcoins, about 750,000 belonged to those who used the exchange.

In a brief statement, the maker of Bayswater and Alexa handbags said Frenchman Guillon had decided to step down immediately. He had been CEO for just over two years, having joined from Birkin handbag maker Hermes <hrms.pa>.

The statement gave no reason for his departure and did not say if he would receive any payoff. "The board agreed that it was now time to part company," a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

"I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he said.

Mulberry shares rose 1.3 percent to 644.5 pence at 0841 GMT.

Under Guillon, Mulberry had hiked prices to take its brand more upmarket from a traditional position of "affordable luxury" and embarked on a drive to increase the company's profile overseas, targeting affluent Asian shoppers with new stores in key tourist spots.

But the group was forced to downgrade its profit forecasts at the end of January for the third time in around 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas hit sales in its British market, which makes up around 65 percent of group revenue.

GROWTH STRATEGY

The warning wiped over 25 percent off its shares at the time, a loss from which they are yet to recover as investors and analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry's growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to suffer from its more upmarket and exclusive aspirations, with evidence growing that even larger rivals like Kering <prtp.pa>and LVMH <lvmh.pa>, Gucci and Louis Vuitton's respective parents, are losing out to newer, more affordable brands.

Since his arrival, Guillon, who has also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry's share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged the stock down to be worth less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned for the final time.

On that occasion the 48 year old, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, had told Reuters his strategy would not change.

Brussels - EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord Thursday on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy. Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People's Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP's Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the eurozone's 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long.

AFP###3484||Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ: ZION) was the one large bank which did not meet the criteria of the latest stress tests that the banks were rallying ahead of. What is interesting is that this was not baked into the cake because the rally was up 3.2% at $32.99 on Thursday.

News wires that were given access to the Federal Reserve data showed that Zions Bancorp fell short on the minimum capital levels. At the low point of a theoretical recession, Zion’s Tier 1 common ratio would be only 3.5%. The Fed wanted to see 5% as a base under that scenario.

Keep in mind that under the severe recession guidelines, it is a scenario where unemployment hits 11.25% and where GDP would be down 5%. Another focal point was for housing prices to be down by 25%.

Zions has a yield of 0.5% with a $0.04 per quarter dividend for its common stock. Even when you consider that this was raised from only $0.01 per share per quarter in 2013, this 0.5% yield is just too low to attract many investors.

Zions will reportedly resubmits its capital plans to the Federal Reserve in April. Zions was trading down 1.5% at $32.50 in the after-hours, against a 52-week range of $23.10 to $33.33.###3485||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

Four banks are so far affected, all of which have links to Russians blacklisted by the US.

Visa and MasterCard, both US-based companies, are forbidden from having any dealings with those targeted by the sanctions.

The banks, which said card services stopped without warning, have described the move as unlawful.

'Frozen out'

One of the banks affected, Bank Rossiya, is described by the US as Russia's 15th largest, with assets of $12bn (£7.27bn).

The St Petersburg-based bank has been singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials. US officials said it would be "frozen out" from the dollar.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bank Rossiya had nothing to do with events in Crimea and promised to transfer his wages there.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

President Putin also instructed the Russian central bank to step in, if needed, but the latter said the sanctions on Bank Rossiya did "not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability".

'Illegitimate'

Visa and Mastercard also confirmed they had stopped providing services to SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

The bank, which is Russia's 39th biggest with $5bn in assets, called the actions "illegitimate" because its owners, rather than the bank itself, were the subject of sanctions.

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

But Visa said more than 99% of its business in Russia was untouched by sanctions.

Russian shares fell sharply on Friday as investors weighed the impact of western sanctions over Ukraine.

The MICEX index, which is priced in roubles, fell as much as 3% and the RTS, which is priced in dollars fell 3.6%.

Stocks slumped after US President Barack Obama said sanctions might be extended to key parts of the Russian economy if Russia took further action in Ukraine.

Share fallsRussia's mining, defence and natural resources sectors could all be targets.

Stocks recovered some ground during the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to restore calm following the introduction of asset freezes and visa bans by the US against high ranking Russian officials.

The MICEX closed down 1% and the RTS index was down 1.3% at the end of the day.

Although only banks with connections to high-ranking Russian officials have been targeted, Russian bank shares were broadly lower.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed 1.17% lower - having fallen 2.9% earlier on Friday, while shares in VTB Bank were 2.61% lower after falling 4.3% earlier in the day.

Other sectors were also hit. Gas giant Gazprom was down 0.9%, oil firm Lukoil ended the day 1.36% higher. Russian steel company NLMK closed 1.94% lower.

Shares in gas producer Novatek closed down 9.63%. The company is part owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder in Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy Russian businessmen targeted by Western sanctions.

Negative outlook

Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch warned they were changing their outlook for the Russian economy to "negative" from "stable" - the first stage before a possible downgrade in the country's credit rating - because of the potential impact of sanctions.

Fitch said: "Since US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."

Beijing (ANTARA News/Xinhua-OANA) - China paid great attention to Australias possible findings related to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Thursday.



Two objects possibly related to flight MH370 have been sighted by satellite in the remote southern Indian Ocean, Australian officials said Thursday.



Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that "new and credible information" based on satellite imagery had come to light, and that four long-range surveillance planes were being diverted to look into the find in the southern Indian Ocean.



China expects the Australian side to send vessels and airplanes as soon as possible to related waters for search and verification, said Hong.



He said the Chinese Foreign Ministry has ordered the embassy and consulates in Australia to keep in close touch with the Australian authorities and assist the Australian side in the searching and rescuing work.



The Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, mysteriously disappeared in the early hours of March 8. A total of 239 people were on board, including 154 Chinese passengers.

Airbnb Inc. is poised to join the 11-digit club.

The company, which was created nearly six years ago as a way to help people find spare rooms and couches to sleep on, is in advanced talks to raise more than $400 million in capital, a round of financing that would value it at more than $10 billion, people briefed on the matter said Thursday.

Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology startup firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing startups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday.

But Airbnb, a centerpiece of what has become known as “the sharing economy,” is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws, and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords, too.

Even so, Ellis conceded that many of the companies now in the limelight were a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits.

Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated — and one of its most disruptive.

An object photographed by a French satellite, and reported to searchers Sunday. And something that looked like a wooden pallet, surrounded by a cluster of other objects — including some that may be tie-down straps, spotted by a single search aircraft spotted.

As the search for the missing flight 370 passes two weeks, searchers have narrowed down the area where they believe the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board could have disappeared. Now, as numerous nations train their eyes on a broad rectangle in the south Indian Ocean, they are beginning to uncover traces of something that could — but is not yet with any certainty — related to the jet.

Still, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott spoke of the "increasing hope" that searchers will find something more tangible.

Story continues below advertisement

If it is a pallet, for example, that could prove a key finding, since wooden pallets are used in air shipping. It could also mean nothing, since pallets are also commonly used in marine shipping.

"So it's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain," said Mike Barton, Rescue Coordination Centre chief with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, speaking on Sunday afternoon.

Still, a second aircraft sent to double-check the possible pallet found nothing Saturday, as skilled searchers confront a vast and remote search area that is stretching the world's best aviation technology to its extreme limits. The difficulty in verifying sightings — U.S. and Chinese satellites have also both located objects of interest that have not been found back by aircraft or ships — only underscores the magnitude of the job at hand. Twenty-six nations are struggling to find a missing aircraft that may have crashed into waters 2,500 kilometres south-west of Australia, among the most remote places on earth, with currents that could move floating debris as much as 150 kilometres every five days.

Flight 370 disappeared in the early morning hours of last Saturday, after deviating from its intended flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Investigators believe it was deliberately diverted, and may have continued on for seven hours flying deep into the south Indian Ocean.

On Sunday, eight aircraft — four civilian, four military — took off to search a 59,000 square kilometre area, the size of Lake Huron. The civilian planes include two Bombardier Global Express, a Gulfstream 5 and an Airbus 319, which have been put into service for their ultra long range. Most of the flying time is spent winging to and from the spot search authorities believe the aircraft is most likely to be found.

The planes are "operating at the limits of their endurance, and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area," said Mr. Barton. "That's only allowing us to get in a singular search a day, which again is spreading the search out several days."

Chinese residents make up nearly two-thirds of the people aboard the plane. Their families have grown increasingly hostile toward search officials, particularly those from Malaysia who families have seen as obfuscating and creating unnecessary delays in locating relatives. On Saturday, a Beijing tense meeting between families and Malaysian officials ended early after emotions boiled over. The two sides met again Sunday, and the families set aside a time to pray.

"I am going to go crazy soon. I am very emotionally unstable," said a woman whose daughter was on board the plane, and who is now taking care of her grandchildren.

China has taken a significant role in the search, and has sent two Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft to Australia. Those planes are expected to begin flying to the search area Monday. China is also sending a cohort of warships and its icebreaker, the Xuelong; the first of those ships should begin to arrive in the area Tuesday.

More aircraft are being deployed in other areas farther north in the Indian Ocean, although significant attention is now being placed on the so-called "southern corridor," where the objects were spotted by satellites.

Weather has hampered efforts in that area, which is mid-way between Australia and Antarctica. On Sunday, searchers arrived to find sea fog and low cloud, although by afternoon that had begun to clear out. A Norwegian ship that had helped the search, the car carrier Hoegh St. Petersburg, left Saturday "in anticipation of bad weather coming through. She was worried about cargo damage, and had done three days worth of work," said John Young, general manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

The southern search area lies squarely inside the "Roaring 40s," a band of south latitude so-called by mariners because it produces fierce weather at the best of times, including winds that frequently approach gale force.

The vastness of the ocean is another complicating factor. Sun glint can obscure objects, and aircraft move so fast that "you only have to be off by a few 100 metres" to miss something, Mr. Barton said.

Still, searchers believe they are narrowing in, in part thanks to the hints provided by satellite images. "Today's search is about a visual search, a complete change of emphasis from earlier searching using radar," Mr. Barton said Sunday.

"We're into a more defined area based on the satellite imagery."###3495||Text size

Here are some things going on this morning in your world of tech:

It's a big morning for initial public offerings. The Nasdaq is welcoming a few new tech names, Borderfree (BRDR), Amber Road (AMBR), and A10 Networks (ATEN), and cloud computing looms large with them.

Borderfree runs a cloud "platform" for cross-border e-commerce, according to its prospectus. It lost $654,000 on revenue of $110 million last year.

Amber Road bills itself as a facilitator of "global trade management," via the cloud, according to its prospectus, as a global supply chain, offering a "proprietary knowledgebase" of regulatory rules to help automate trade management for companies. It lost $14.4 million last year on revenue of $52.5 million.

A10 Networks is a vendor of so-called "application delivery controllers," and has been in litigation in past with the dominant vendor in that market, F5 Networks (FFIV). It lost $27,096 last year on revenue of $141.7 million, according to its prospectus.

Shares of Borderfree are up $3.50, or 22%, at $19.50, after pricing at $16. Amber Road is up $3.87, or almost 30%, at $16.87, after pricing at $13. And A10 shares are up just 9 cents, at $15.09, after opening at $13.85, below the $15 price of the IPO. A10's shares were delayed for a while this morning, and CNBC's Bob Pisani, noting the unusual circumstances, reported the company was in some last-minute haggling with the Securities & Exchange Commission about its filings.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) are up 77 cents at $529.47, after Macquarie USA Equities Research's Ben Schachter initiated the stock with an Outperform rating, and a $630 price target, writing that the iTunes business and other software and services are "under appreciated businesses" that he thinks "will be a key profit growth driver" in future, rising from 8% of sales and about 12% of Ebitda in 2012 to 13% of sales and nearly 30% of total Ebitda by 2016. "By 2020, it could drive almost 40% of all Apple profits."

"The bottom line is that while Apple's current hardware businesses face many challenges and new product introductions remain uncertain, its high-margin iTunes/Software/Services businesses will drive profit growth," writes Schachter, combined with "its substantial cash position, cash generating abilities, and new opportunities."

Shares of Symantec (SYMC) are down $2.93, or almost 14%, at $17.98, after the company yesterday afternoon abruptly announced it terminated CEO Steve Bennett, saying it needed new management to "driver on the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth.

The stock has gotten gotten five downgrades this morning, that I can see, from Jefferies & Co., R.W. Baird, UBS, MKM Partners, and Cowen & Co.

Cowen's Gregg Moskowitz, cutting his rating to Market Perform from Outperform, writes of Bennett "His strategy was, in our view, necessarily far-reaching, and some disruption had always been inevitable. Nonetheless, the impact to bookings over the last two quarters had been more painful than most, including us, had expected."

Moskowitz concludes "We continue to believe 30%+ op. margins by FY17 is very achievable; however, given the changing of the guard, our prior view that SYMC could be a mid 30s op. margin company in 3-4 years no longer holds. We also continue to be very skeptical of SYMC's 5%+ growth target, regardless of how much increased emphasis SYMC may opt to place on this going forward."

On the other hand, Citigroup's Walter Pritchard, reiterating a Buy rating, and a $28 price target, writes that "shares are cheap and investor sentiment is worst in our space," with the stock at eight times cash flow. "While fundamentals may have taken a turn for the worst, we note that our FCF (unlevered) estimate for FY14 ($1.28B) is below average of last year's ($1.48B) and looks reasonable to us."###3496||Empty###3497||Empty###3498||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Shares of Symantec Corp. tumbled Friday, a day after the security software company abruptly terminated Chief Executive Steve Bennett.

Symantec SYMC, +2.67% fell 13% to close at $18.20 on the sudden management change. Board member Michael Brown has been named interim CEO.

“While the timing of this is unfortunate with only 11 days left in the fiscal year, the company did reiterate long-term and fiscal fourth quarter guidance,” J.P. Morgan analyst John DiFucci told clients in a note.

While Bennett pursued the right strategy for the company, he argued, “his execution did not go as well as planned, and I believe product innovation has been slower than anticipated by the board.”

Symantec was the worst performer on the S&P 500 SPX, +0.56% which was down a fraction.

Technology stocks were mostly lower, with Hewlett-Packard HPQ, +0.04% up 1.5% to close at $31.95 and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.82% gaining 1.6% to close at $50.92.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.38% shed nearly 1% to close at 4,277. But tech-heavy benchmark ended the week up nearly 1%.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.85% and the Morgan Stanley High Tech 35 US:MSH Index were down a fraction on Friday.

Houma-Thibodaux posted the state’s lowest jobless rate at 3.5 percent in January, down from 5.1 percent the month before, new data show.

The metro area, comprised of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, has posted the lowest unemployment rate among Louisiana’s eight metro areas every month for the past two years, except in October 2012.

Louisiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in January was the lowest since September 2008 and lowest in the 17-state southern region, where the average rate was 6.2 percent, according to data released Monday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent; it was 6.7 percent last month.

Houma-Thibodaux had an estimated 99,500 people employed in nonfarm jobs in December, the new figures show. That’s down 500 jobs for the month but up 2,300 for the year.

Goods-producing employment decreased by 600 jobs over the month and added 1,000 jobs over the year. Service-providing jobs increased by 100 for the month and 1,300 for the year.

The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved over the year in every parish as well as in all other Louisiana metro areas as follows:

Alexandria: 5.2 percent, down from 7.5 percent in January 2013;

Baton Rouge: 4.8 percent, down from 7.1 percent;

Lafayette: 3.9 percent, down from 5.5 percent;

Gullions departure is just the latest shake-up at the troubled heritage brand. Last June, its creative director Emma Hill  the woman regarded by many to be instrumental in Mulberrys resurgence  left after six years at the helm, citing creative differences. That November, it cancelled its February 2014 fashion show, and shares have slumped 67% since Guillon joined.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###3514||Empty###3515||Economic expectations for Germany worsened in March, burdened by the Crimea crisis, while the assessment of current situation hit the highest level since 2011, survey data from the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW revealed Tuesday.

The economic confidence index dropped more-than-expected to 46.6 in March from 55.7 in February. The March score was the weakest since August 2013. It was forecast to fall less markedly to 52.

"In this month's survey the Crimea Crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW President Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

Meanwhile, the measure of experts' assessment of the current economic situation improved to 51.3 points, the highest since August 2011, from 50 in February. The assessment strengthened for the fourth month in a row, but stayed below the expected level of 52.

The economic expectations index for the Eurozone declined by 7 points to 61.5 threshold. By contrast, the indicator for the current economic situation gained 3.5 points to minus 36.7 points in March.

Although the current political relationship with Russia might have limited impact on the German , the possible upcoming measures will put the German recovery to a serious test, ING Bank NV Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

The largest Eurozone economy grew 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter and the government expects it to expand 1.8 percent this year.

The European Commission raised the country's growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent and the projection for 2015 was lifted to 2 percent from 1.9 percent.

Interactive: What we know so far

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia —

Malaysia's defense minister says a Chinese satellite has spotted a large object along a broad stretch of ocean where officials hope to find a Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing for more than two weeks.

Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 30 meters (100 feet).

He said, "The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify."

He said he had no other information and that China would release further details. It was not immediately clear whether the object was seen near where another satellite found two objects earlier this week.

The stock is down 4% for three months, nearly 5% for the year to date and 7% since the beginning of December. Shares are currently at $74.75.

Even less attractive have been the images presented to TheStreet's readers by Rocco Pendola.

Walmart may not be able to exchange its image at the moment, but on Tuesday it announced you can now come in and exchange your used video games. This is a $2 billion industry that is currently dominated by, among others, GameStop (GME).



WATCH: Jim Cramer Prefers Take-Two, EA to Walmart and GameStop

Beginning March 26, Walmart customers may bring in used video games from popular consoles like Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox 360 and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation3. Customers will receive a store credit, which can be used at Walmart and Sam's Club stores.

Unlike similar trade-in programs, Walmart won't offer cash for the exchange at more than 3,100 stores, but customers can use the credit towards online Walmart purchases such as mobile devices. Walmart also plans to send those games traded in off for refurbishing and sold "like new."

If this sounds like a pawn shop, it's because pawn shops operate under a similar models. Blockbuster also tried this trade-in tactic and it failed. Both Amazon (AMZN) and Target (TGT) have begun playing this game.

But given Walmart's dominance across the U.S., there is a strong market for what the company might be able to produce, which will help revenue.

There may be an element of "so what" here. But before you knock this idea, consider that Wal-Mart posted $11.9 billion in revenue for all of 2013. The pre-owned gaming market is said to be a $2 billion industry, which represents 16% of Wal-Mart's annual revenue.

All but one of the 30 largest banks are now strong enough to weather another severe economic crash, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

In the newest of the series of health examinations mandated after the 2008 financial crisis, only Zions Bancorp could not measure up to a basic capital standard in a theoretical drastic meltdown of the economy.

Twenty-nine bank holding companies held up in the worst-case scenario with a cumulative 7.8 percent Tier 1 common ratio, a basic measure of capital strength, down from 11.5 percent at the end of the third quarter last year, but ending well above the 5.0 percent minimum target.

That represented a steady strengthening of the sector since the tests began three years ago,

Salt Lake City, Utah-based Zions Bancorp was the only one which fell below the threshold, finishing the year-long period of the theoretical meltdown with just a 3.5 percent tier 1 common ratio — the level of shareholder equity and reserves.

The banks were measured against a situation when real gross domestic product contracts 4.75 percent, the unemployment rate hits 11.25 percent, equities shed half their value and home prices lose a quarter of their value.

Walmart is looking to stomp on competitor GameStop by kicking off a game trade-in program on March 26. Later this year the retailing giant will start selling pre-owned games.

GameStop's long-running program of accepting trade-in games for cash or in-store credit will be replicated by the nation's largest retail chain. Walmart and Sam's Club will allow customers to trade in games for Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 and immediately apply that value to any new purchase both in store or online, the company said.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Those interested in trading in their games will bring them to the store's electronics' department with the original case. An associate will then scan the game's bar code and evaluate the overall condition of the game. The customer will then be offered a trade-in value that can be accepted or denied. If accepted, the amount immediately becomes available to the customer for use in a future purchase.

Walmart said trade-in prices will range up to $35 per game. The program only includes games, not the hardware.

This program, obviously, will lead to Walmart starting to sell certified pre-owned video games later this year. These will be sold both online and in store. The company promises that these used games will be refurbished and in "like new" condition.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," added Mac Naughton.

Walmart already accepts trade-ins for tablets and smartphones.

The importance of the gaming market was clearly made yesterday as the research firm GFK Chart Trak reported that Titanfall from Electronic Arts landed in the top spot on the UK gaming charts. In addition, GFK credited the game with a 96 percent increase in UK Xbox One sales. Of these purchases, 70 percent took place through the TitanFall/Xbox One bundle that was offered.

Do not reproduce without permission.###3525||On Friday the Salt Lake City-headquartered Zions Bancorporation (ZION) was found to have insufficient reserves to cover themselves in the event of financial catastrophe, failing a stress test administered by the Federal Reserve. Zions will be forced to shore up their reserves, shed their riskiest loans, and resubmit for approval.

These stress tests are designed to prevent another meltdown like the one the occurred in 2008 from ever again happening. The Federal Reserve’s stress tests however, which are conducted on every major and regional lender in the US, have to strike a tricky balance.

On one hand, the Fed can’t fail too many banks at once or get too byzantine with their punishments. They can’t just close the bank outright, leaving thousands of depositors in limbo. They also can’t flunk too many banks at once or they could threaten to jumpstart a panic.

At the same time the Fed cannot be too lenient in their stress tests. If they start rubber-stamping banks to try to avoid freaking out the populace, stress tests become purposeless.

So what happens to Zions after they fail the test? They are given a couple months to fix the problems by getting the riskiest mortgages off their books. They strengthen their reserves. And if they fail again, they can have their credit rating slashed, digging them further down the hole.

This is where Zion finds themselves. And it looks bad – of 30 major banks tested, they were the only ones to fail. But while they have failed the Fed’s stress test, they are getting a second chance. They will be continued to allow to operate even if they continually fail, which will certainly hurt them going forward and could make their situation dire, no matter what the macro conditions are.

Zion operates under the name Zion in Utah and Cal Bank and Trust in California. They have some $55 billion in assets and currently have a market cap of $5.84 billion.

By midday trading on Friday shares of Zions had fallen 4.30 percent to hit $31.57 a share.

The US has already introduced asset freezes and visa bans on high ranking Russian officials – now Visa and Mastercard have also stopped providing services to two Russian banks, St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya and SMP Bank.

Bank Rossiya, which was put under U.S. sanctions on Thursday, responded by saying it was working in a ‘stable regime’ and was taking all the necessary legal measures to defend the bank's and its clients' rights and legal interests.

US officials have singled out Bank Rossiya, Russia’s 17th largest lender, because it is the personal bank for senior Russian officials and is controlled by an associate of the president.

However, President Vladimir Putin has since vowed to keep his salary at the bank. He said it had nothing to do with the events in Crimea, and has promised to protect the institution.

‘The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them,’ the bank said in a statement.

But is there going to be widespread panic at Harrods and Harvey Nicks this lunchtime as London-based Russians go out to blow a few hundred grand on caviar and Chanel only to find they get their credit cards snipped in half?

The US has imposed sanctions over Russian individuals for their part in Russia’s seizure of Crimea on Thursday, and it has begun preparations for economic sanctions if Russia expands its footprint in Ukraine.

Moscow’s Micex index has lost more than 10% this month, wiping out billions in market capitalization.

European leaders have also added 12 people to a list of those subject to travel bans and asset freezes over the Crimea standoff.

According to Reuters, French President Francois Hollande declined to give details of the names added to the list, which was agreed among the EU's 28 leaders after six hours of talks, but said it included Russians and Crimeans and raised the total number of people subject to EU sanctions to 33.###3528||Empty###3529||WASHINGTON — Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state — Iowa — where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that’s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That’s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation’s job market than the employer survey did.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state’s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.

North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.

Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn’t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.

The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.

California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.###3530||Empty###3531||MOSCOW — Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin’s entourage.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin’s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 per cent in midday trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 per cent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank’s. They can also get cash directly inside their banks’ branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them,” according to the Interfax news agency.

Describing Rossiya, which was rumoured to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after

S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.###3532||Groups at Halifax Health Medical Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday will help guide the public through the enrollment process.

DAYTONA BEACH — Supporters of the president’s health care law will make one last push on Sunday to sign people up for coverage before the March 31 enrollment deadline and are hoping for an appearance from Vice President Joe Biden to generate interest.

A variety of community groups, along with representatives from insurance carriers, will be at Halifax Health Medical Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday to guide the public through the enrollment process. Organizers have requested an appearance from Biden, but no commitments have been made.

Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said he assisted in organizing the event because he hears often from constituents who are dealing with medical emergencies and lack insurance coverage.

“The intent of the event is to ensure people in middle to lower income America have access to affordable health care,” Henry said. “We want them to be informed. This is an opportunity to enroll in insurance that will meet their needs.”

More than 100,000 people in Volusia and Flagler counties lack insurance coverage. Insurance plans in the federally run online marketplace — HealthCare.gov — are offered by private carriers. Government tax subsidies to make coverage more affordable are available for those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level — about $11,670 to $46,680 for an individual. Those without insurance will face a $95 penalty or 1 percent of their income — whichever is greater. Hardship exemptions are available.

The Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida, which received funds from a federal grant to educate the public about the health care law, has requested Biden or another “high-ranking official” appear in Daytona Beach. While first lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have touted the law elsewhere in the state, no high-ranking officials have visited locally. On Thursday, President Barack Obama visited Valencia College in Orlando to speak on women’s economic issues.

“I’ve been really trying to bang the drum for this community,” said Joyce Case, who oversees enrollment counselors called navigators for the Health Planning Council. “We are always neglected because of Orlando or Jacksonville. We have a very high number of uninsured in our community. We need it just as bad.”

Organizers would likely be given short notice if Biden or another high-ranking member of the administration decided to make an appearance, Case said. Biden recently returned to the states from a visit overseas to deal with the crisis in Ukraine, according to his public schedules.

Florida is seen as a critical state for the success of the Affordable Care Act. It has 3.8 million uninsured residents — the second highest number of any state in the nation. The health care law has met political resistance from the Republican Party in Florida. The state Legislature declined to expand Medicaid with the help of federal dollars because of opposition in the House.

As of March 1, 442,087 Floridians have selected a plan in the marketplace, according to the latest enrollment numbers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Case said she’s noticed interest has been mounting this week as the government ramps up its advertising efforts.

Mincy Pollock, who is helping to organize the event in Daytona Beach, said he hopes that number grows during the last week of enrollment.

He suspects some people are intimidated by the website and the enrollment process.

“We are trying to create an event that’s nonthreatening — sort of fun,” said Pollock, general manager of Jacksonville-based First Coast Multi-Lines Agency, an insurance broker. “We are going to hold their hands through the entire process.”

Those who miss the March 31 deadline can apply for coverage during the next open enrollment, which runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.###3533||March 21, 2014

NEW YORK—Security software maker Symantec says it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named director Michael Brown as his temporary replacement.

Bennett has been president and CEO of the company since July 2012. Symantec said that he resigned from the board of directors after his termination. He was also chairman of the company until Symantec split the chairman and CEO roles in January 2013.

The Mountain View, Calif., company did not cite a precise reason for Bennett’s ouster.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman said in a press release.

Brown has been with the company since July 2005. He is the former chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.###3534||1 of 6 View Caption

And now, they want a piece of that sweet pre-owned games pie that GameStop controls almost exclusively.

Beginning March 26, shoppers will be able to trade-in their used games at any Walmart or Sam’s Club store. Instead of cash, the retailer will offer a Walmart/Sam’s Club gift card in exchange for the games. The gift card won’t be limited to games and can be used on anything in the store or on the Walmart/Sam’s Club website. To be eligible for Walmart’s trade-in program, the games must be in playable condition and in their original box. And a Walmart employee will check them for “obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks” before trade-in credit will be issued.

So what does Walmart plan to do with all these used games? After the company takes possession of your games, they will be shipped off to a central processing facility where they will be resurfaced and repackaged. Afterwards, they will be sold in Walmart stores as “Certified Pre-Owned” titles. The process appears to be very similar to how Best Buy currently handles used games.###3537||Empty###3538||Symantec has fired its second CEO in two years: the company's chief exec, president and former board chairman Steve Bennett was today shown the door after less than 18 months on the job.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," the company said in a statement.

"We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5 per cent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 per cent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

The language of the statement leaves little doubt about the extent of the exasperation of the board with Bennett. His position was "terminated," and he has been forced to resign his board position within the company. This compares with more moderate language when Symantec fired the last CEO Enrique Salem

Bennett's replacement, for the moment at least, is former chairman of the Symantec board Michael Brown. He is resigning his position on Symantec's Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee as part of the move.

"With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan," said the new boss.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market. By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

That last sentence shows part of the reason why Bennett was so abruptly fired. The past few years have not been happy ones for Symantec, with serious job losses at both the executive level and among the workers that have improved profitability figures, even though sales have remained fairly static.

The search will now start for a new CEO to take up the chalice of leadership of the troubled security and storage giant. Sadly for the company, John Thompson, arguably Symantec's most successful CEO, has his hands full as chairman of Microsoft's board and is not available for new "opportunities." ®

The Treasury believes that around three per cent - amounting to a total of £45m - of pound coins are fake.

To combat the problem a new 12-sided pound coin will be introduced in 2017.

But until then how can you tell if your pound coins are genuine or fake?

Key signs of a fake are:

- Quality. A genuine coin will have sharp, clearly defined markings of the Queen's head or the picture on the flip side.

- Alignment. The Queen's head and the picture on the flip side should line up, as in the image above. They are often askew on fake coins.

- Design. The design on the reverse of the coin corresponds with a specific year of production. A list of the correct designs can be found here

- Colour. If the colour does not match the usual colour of most pound coins it is likely to be fake, or if on old coin shows no sign of ageing it could be fake.

- Milled edge. Uneven depth in the lettering or spacing is a sign of a fake.###3541||Joining the likes of GameStop, Best Buy and Target, Wal-Mart has announced that it's entering the used video games market, allowing customers to trade in pre-owned games in exhange for anything in-store or online, be it groceries, gadgets or whatever.

[Via Yahoo! News | Thanks, Brendan]###3542||A United States Navy P-8 Poseidon has been unable to find objects spotted by a Chinese aircraft hunting for clues to the missing Malaysian jet in the Indian Ocean, Australian authorities say.

Australian authorities are leading an international search along a southern arc for Flight MH370, which vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board after taking off for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

Photo: AAP

The objects were spotted by the Chinese aircraft from 33,000 feet, as it was heading back to Perth.

Drift modelling was undertaken on the sighting but the P-8 was unable to relocate the reported objects.

The Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft spotted two relatively big floating objects and several smaller white ones dispersed over several kilometers.

The official Xinhua news agency carried the report, saying the "white and square" objects were spotted by searchers aboard a Chinese Ilyushin jet. Two floating were "relatively big" and there several smaller white ones dispersed over several kilometres.

The crew reported the co-ordinates as 95.1113 degrees east and 42.5453 south to the Australian command centre as well as Chinese icebreaker Xuelong, which is en route to the area on Monday, AFP reports.

However, Australian authorities later said the US Navy had been unable to find the objects.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said its search area also continues to be based on US satellite images of two floating objects taken on 16 March.

Chinese aircraft join search

Chinese aircraft joined nine others from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan on Monday in the search of remote seas 2500km off Western Australia, where it is thought the plane may have crashed.

The search took on a new dimension after the French said on Sunday they had picked up images of possible aircraft debris some 850km north of the present search area.

Two Chinese military aircraft, two Australian P3 Orions and two ultra-long range civilian jets were the first to search the site on Monday. Another ultra-long range jet, a US Navy P8 Poseidon and two Japanese P3 Orions would go later in the day.

Australian Navy tanker HMAS Success is also searching and several Chinese ships are on their way to help find any objects spotted from the air.

Tropical Cyclone Gillian, near Christmas Island, could bring bad weather south, hindering search efforts.

New theory on malfunction

A new report says military radar shows the plane turned as much as 180 degrees and dived to about 4000 metres - a height at which people can breath without oxygen masks - when it turned from its route to Beijing.

The new detail may support a theory that there was a major malfunction, such as a cockpit fire. Military radar tracking shows that the aircraft changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation into the missing flight told CNN.

The plane flew as low as 4000 metres at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The sharp turn seemed to be intentional, the source told CNN.

The official said the area the plane flew in after the turn was a heavily trafficked air corridor and that flying at the lower height would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic.

NZ crew remain hopeful

The crew of a New Zealand Air Force Orion remains upbeat, despite another failed attempt to find the airliner. The Orion returned to its base in Western Australia about 4.30am on Monday after its latest search.

RNZAF Squadron Leader Brett MacKenzie was on board that flight and said spotting debris from the air is a difficult task.

"You're travelling in an aircraft that's doing 200 miles per hour. The world is whistling past you and you're looking for an object in amongst the whitecaps. You've got to be concentrating constantly - two, two-and-a-half hours - so a couple of moments of inattention you might miss something that's important."

The search on Sunday was hampered by thick fog and cloud, but acting chief of the Air Force Air Commodore Mike Yardley said the Orion's crew haven't given up hope of finding the airliner. He said searchers have been buoyed by the news radar echoes from a French satellite showing possible debris in the search area have been passed to Australian authorities.

"They think with the weight of evidence they're seeing from the operations staff briefing them that they are in the right area and they're determined to go out there and find something."

Air Commodore Yardley said New Zealand has been asked to provide more staff to analyse data from satellites and search planes. "Weather conditions were not great. We had sea fog right down to the surface of the water in half the area; then 600 foot of cloud in the other half of the area - so not great searching conditions."###3543||Russian stocks and government bonds fell today after the US and European Union increased sanctions against Russian politicians and business leaders.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called “Savings Catcher” on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.’s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for “technological answers to saving them money and time.”

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it’s hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn’t include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn’t apply to general merchandise such as clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately.

Wal-Mart’s MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don’t feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart’s focus group. She said she’s been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she’s never had time to take advantage of price matching.

“They’re doing the work for me,” said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. “The only thing they’re not doing is putting the groceries away.”###3547||A woman looks at the Obamacare HealthCare insurance exchange Internet site (AFP)

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration published in the Federal Register new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would have to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning January 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

“Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can’t finish, we won’t shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don’t have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can’t get coverage again until next year,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare’s six-month enrollment period. Most of those bugs have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website’s capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.

[Image via Agence France-Presse]###3548||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — GameStop Corp. was a notable loser in the S&P 500 on Tuesday amid concerns that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. may threaten its hold on the used videogame market while Microsoft Corp. rose on a price target hike.

GameStop GME, -3.97% shares dropped 3.1%. The move came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.55% said it would allow customers to hand in used videogames in exchange for gift cards, which can be used in its retail stores or online. The change in policy from Wal-Mart Stores could eat away at GameStop’s dominance of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S. Wal-Mart shares are up marginally.

Microsoft MSFT, +1.27% shares rose 4.3%. Analysts at Barclays hiked the stock’s price target to $44 from $43. “Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365. It can drive better earnings growth as it transitions its ubiquitous on-premise install bases (Office and Windows Server) to its cloud platforms,” analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a report. Barclays rates the stock at overweight.

Decliners

Bloomberg GameStop shares are sliding.

NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +2.02% shares fell 3.1%. The exchange operator will host an investor’s day on March 27. Analysts from Jefferies who recently met with Nasdaq executives said the management is upbeat about Nasdaq OMX NLX, its derivatives platform.

SanDisk Corp. US:SNDK shares gained 4.4%. The stock will be added to the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index on March 24. The index is composed of 100 tech and telecommunications companies that regularly pay a dividend.

Shares of United States Steel Corp. X, +3.18% rose 5.3%. Analysts at Nomura lowered U.S. Steel’s first-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to 35 cents from 40 cents. The stock is rated a buy with a target price of $32. The stock is down 14% year to date.

Tickers to Watch

Analysts at Mizuho said they would be buyers of hospital stocks like Tenet due to the sector’s recent weakness on changes related to individual mandate exemption rules and earnings. “We do not think either issue will have a meaningful negative impact on our EPS estimates for the hospital group,” the analysts said in a note. Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, +0.52% climbed 3.4% and HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, +0.68% advanced 2.2%.

The coin, which is intended to be the “most secure in the world”, draws inspiration from the design of the old 3d (3 penny) coin, which was in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

It will launch in 2017, and comes following concerns the 30-year old coin is becoming vulnerable to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

In a statement, the Royal Mint said: “The proposed £1 coin design is distinctly British, with a twelve-sided shape which evokes memories of the pre-decimalisation threepence piece.”

The coin will be made of two different coloured metals and contain security features in line with the Royal Mint’s currency security network, iSIS.

The public and industry stakeholders will be consulted on the proposals this summer. There will also be a competition for the design on the reverse, or ‘tails’, side of the coin.

Chancellor George Osborne ism expected to officially unveil the new coin today, as he sets out his plans for the 2014/15 financial year.###3554||Posted by News

Sally Beauty Suffers Security Data Breach Of Less Than 25,000 Accounts

Another retailer is letting people know that they too suffered a security breach.

Denton, Texas-based Sally Beauty, one of the largest retailers of professional beauty products in the world, said it found a breach on March 5, which affected less than 25,000 debit and credit card accounts. The company said it was working alongside a forensics firm and the U.S. Secret Service to identify the breach.

The company said it takes this situation quite seriously. They’re working with Verizon about the matter and taking the necessary precautions and actions to deal with the issue the security incident has caused. Sally Beauty said a preliminary investigation was being handled by the Secret Service.

Breaches in personal data have been a real issue for retailers, and has shaken consumer confidence, especially after Target’s significant Thanksgiving security breach. Neiman Marcus and other retailers have said they have also suffered with data breaches during the holiday season. For Target, the breach may have curbed customer traffic.

Sally Beauty has over 2,800 stores around the world including the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. It also provides more than 6,000 professional quality products for skin, nails and hair for salon professionals and retail customers.

Online News Heard Now###3555||If GameStop and Walmart were cowboys, this is the part where we’d all have to run for safety behind the barber and saloon while they stared each other down at high noon.

Walmart, the world’s largest megaretailer, is getting into the used-games business in the U.S. The company revealed today that it will start accepting trade-ins March 26. The company will give customers gift cards in exchange for old games, and those cards are good for any item at Walmart or Sam’s Club. This strategy could help one of the largest retail operations pick up a bigger chunk of the $13 billion that U.S. consumers spend on games at retail. This may also force GameStop, the huge gaming-specific retailer in the U.S., to offer better used-game prices to keep up with the competition.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,” Walmart chief marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said in a statement. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

We’ve reached out to GameStop for a comment on this. We’ll update this story with any new information. In addition to Walmart and GameStop, companies like Amazon and Best Buy all accept used games in exchange for store credit.

While the trade-in program starts next week, Walmart won’t begin selling used games until later this year — likely after it builds up an inventory. When a trade-in begins, the stores will examine each game disc to make sure it is operational. The company will then refurbish the discs to sell in a “like new” condition.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy preowned games,” Mac Naughton said.

Walmart isn’t new to offering gift cards for old items. The retailer currently accepts tablets and smartphones in exchange for credit at its stores. It also sells those refurbished items on its website. We’ve reached out to the company to ask if this means it will also accept used gaming hardware. We’ll update this post once we have that information.

In an interview with CRN on Friday, Stephen Gillett, Symantec's executive vice president and chief operating officer and driver of the company's recently recalibrated channel activities, said the board of directors decided it was time to return to growth in an accelerated fashion to meet market demands. Symantec's focus moving forward will be to execute on product innovation and bringing new products to market, Gillett said.

Symantec's board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer on Thursday, in an move that shocked many Symantec employees, including Gillett. Brown is accomplished at being a stabilizing presence, according to Gillett, who said he will be a knowledgeable leader and organizer during the company's transition.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005. Gillett said he worked with Brown in 2012 during his tenure on the company's board of directors.

[Related: Symantec Internal Memo: Pace Of Change Was Too Slow ]

"[Brown] will be focused on keeping forward momentum and not stalling as we focus on product activities and accelerating growth," Gillett said.

Gillett, who joined Symantec in December 2012 after holding senior executive positions at Best Buy and Starbucks, has a deep technical background, having worked in information technology nearly his entire career. He said the Symantec's engineering teams have all the pieces in place to build out the portfolio and bring new products to market.

When Bennett took the helm in July 2012, he did a lot of streamlining at Symantec via his Symantec 4.0 strategy, including making the company's product teams report directly to him. Bennett has previously told CRN that move was aimed at boosting productivity and accelerating innovation, but Gillett said Symantec's board of directors didn't feel this would enable the the company to bring new products to market quickly enough.

Gillett said the "apparatus and cadence that allows development cycles to be met happen regardless of who is at the top operationally."

Under Brown, Symantec's project engineering, technical support and research and development activities will all be getting more attention, Gillett said. Symantec's executive team is working on a revised list of priorities for its fiscal 2015 strategy and product roadmap, he said.

"The organizational structure, in reporting to Steve, did little in the way of blocking or changing dramatically the progress we're making in the product roadmaps, integrating our point products combined with new technology development," Gillett said. "There is nothing I see or know that will be coming that should be cause for any concern for our progress to change."

Gillett urged partners to be patient as the board of directors conducts its search for a new CEO. He said he is an advocate of the channel, having procured goods and services from partners. A consistent effort is being made behind the scenes in transforming Symantec into a channel led organization, Gillett said. "That importance of that effort has been reinforced to me by our interim CEO," he said.

Symantec partners tell CRN that they have welcomed the organizational changes and say its time to reveal more details about the company's newly integrated product offerings. Time will tell how this will work out for Symantec, said John Woodall, vice president of engineering at Integrated Archive Systems (IAS), a Palo Alto, Calif.-based solution provider and Symantec channel partner.

"We'll have to wait for Symantec 5.0," Woodall said. "We'll need time to see how the company does. But whoever comes in to replace Bennett will have to define the company's strategy quickly and communicate its plans. This market is too volatile on too many levels."

Symantec is not going away, Woodall said. "It's a strong company. For us now, it's business as usual."

CRN Senior Editor Joseph F. Kovar contributed to this report.###3568||Today, The Wall Street Journal reports that Citi Bike is in need of funds, due in part to a “number of costly issues, including damage to equipment during superstorm Sandy, software glitches and a difficult 2013-14 winter that discouraged ridership.”

Unlike most other U.S. bike sharing systems, Citi Bike is entirely privately funded with sponsorships from Citi Bank ($41 million) and Mastercard ($6.5 million), along with financing from Goldman Sachs. This limited funding pool means that any other funding needs fall on riders. Raising user fees to cover costs — which is similar to raising fares for transit systems — increases the user’s burden, is not a sustainable source of revenue and, of course, makes it even more difficult for low- and middle-income riders to access the system.

TSTC took a look at three other programs – Washington D.C.’s Capital Bike Share, Boston’s Hubway and the Twin Cities’ Nice Ride – to see how these programs raise funds for capital and operating expenses and what New York City can learn from how these systems are funded. And while farebox recovery rates for each system tend to be high (according to most recent figures available: Capital Bikeshare generated 97 percent; Hubway, 88 percent; and Nice Ride, 62 percent), funding comes from numerous sources.

Public-Private Partnerships

Capital Bike Share and Hubway, which are both public-private partnerships, receive capital and operating funds from a combination of federal and state grants, local contributions and corporate sponsors (in addition to user fees). Hubway received capital and operating funds for the first three years of operation through federal CMAQ and FTA grants, and a contribution from the Boston Public Health Commission, on top of corporate sponsorships and user fees. Capital Bike Share similarly receives CMAQ funding, as well as state, county and city contributions. Their latest system expansion (20 new stations and 200 bikes in Montgomery County, Maryland) was funded by a federal grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board. Hubway and Capital Bikeshare both receive funding from local universities and hospitals as well.

Non-Profit Organizations

Nice Ride receives operating and capital funding from local and federal grants, private foundations, and for-profit companies. According to the organization’s 2012 Annual Report and 2013 Mid-Season Update, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Bike Walk Twin Cities (funded through the Federal Highway Administration) comprise 71 percent of the organization’s 2010-2013 expansion funds. From 2010 to 2012 (the report lacks complete operating expenses and funding data for 2013), contributions from station sponsors, which include local institutions, businesses, private firms, corporations, co-ops and the City of Minneapolis Public Works/ABS Ramps and MPLS Parking, accounted for 40 percent of the system’s operating costs during this period.

The Case for Public Funding

ITDP’s The Bike-Share Planning Guide makes the case that bike share programs should be thought of as part of a greater public transportation system and should be funded as such:

Government funding for capital costs and operations makes sense in light of the fact that bike-share is part of the larger public transport network, and when all internal and external costs and benefits are considered, it is probable that bike-share will have a lower per person cost than any other public transport option.

Other public transportation systems in New York City receive federal, state and city funding. New York City’s East River Ferries received $9.3 million over three years from the City, despite having a daily ridership a fraction of Citi Bike’s. And, as the charts below make clear, the MTA’s buses, subways and rail also receives a combination of funds to pay for operating and capital costs.

Sources of Operating Funds Expended (from the National Transit Database, 2012)

System Fare Revenues Local Funds State Funds Federal Assistance Other Funds LIRR 48% 12% 35% 0% 5% MNR 59% 7% 28% 0% 5% NYCT 43% 16% 38% 0% 4%

Sources of Capital Funds Expended (from NTD Database, 2012)

System Fare Revenues Local Funds State Funds Federal Assistance Other Funds LIRR – 45% 5% 50% 0% MNR – 64% 1% 35% 0% NYCT – 15% 1% 35% 48%

With over 5 million trips in the first eight months, a recent survey that shows 91 percent of Citi Bikers would like to see the system expand, and calls from outer boroughs to bring Citi Bike to their neighborhoods, it’s clear that New York City loves its bike share. It’s also clear that if Citi Bike is to meet this demand, the financial burden for expansion cannot fall solely on its riders. Regardless of the source, a broadened funding base is key for Citi Bike to expand into transit-starved neighborhoods while keeping bike share affordable.###3569||Wal-Mart and other retailers are serving customers doing home improvement at the beginning of the spring season.(Photo : Reuters)

According to the press release, games must be in the materials they came in, and brought to the electronics department in any Wal-Mart store,

Store employees will enter the game into their system, and check the product to see what wear and tear it has including deep scratches, or cracks the press release reported.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart said in a statement on the company's blog.

Wal-Mart will then give customers the amount the game is worth so they can use the funds on another product at Wal-Mart's over 3,100 locations throughout the United States.

The process applies for every game someone turns into the program, dubbed the video game trade-in program the press release reported.

Thousands of games compatible with Sony PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Xbox 360 are eligible for the program.###3570||Empty###3571||As you've probably noted by now, Symantec just announced that CEO Steve Bennett is out and is being replaced by board member Michael Brown on a temporary basis. The board will now conduct a search for a permanent CEO.

Under Steve Bennett, Symantec announced a new strategy called, "Symantec 4.0," intended to streamline the organization, cut costs, and push organic innovation. A good plan, but my guess is that things weren't moving forward as fast as the board wanted, so it decided to make a change. As an outsider, it did seem like Symantec circled the wagons, focused on internal operations, and kept its eyes off the market. Thus, the company now looking for its fourth CEO in the past five years.

So what should the next CEO of Symantec do? I'm pretty sure that Symantec's board won't be calling me to set up an interview, but if I took over as the next CEO of Symantec, I'd push the company to:

1. Become the leading provider of managed and professional security services. Managed security services are growing twice as fast as product sales while the information security skills shortage gets worse each day. This makes this a no-brainer for Symantec - it already has great services and assets here but needs a few course corrections. First, the company has to become easier to do business with and improve the overall customer experience. Second, the company needs to extend its services more aggressively and supplement managed services with more professional services feet-on-the-street. Finally, Symantec managed services is one of the best-kept secrets in the industry. Symantec needs to put some marketing dough behind this effort to gain visibility and brand recognition.

2. Get active in M&A again. I get the desire for organic growth, but I really don't understand why Symantec did a 180 on acquiring companies. Yes, there were questionable moves, like buying PGP and GuardianEdge at the same time, but Symantec also had some winners such as MessageLabs, Mi5, Verisign, and Vontu. Now that the VC bourgeoisie on Sand Hill Rd. is investing heavily in security startups, Symantec should start cherry picking firms, especially those focused on advanced malware (Bit9, Bromium, Cylance, Invincea) big data security analytics (Click Security, Lancope, LogRhythm, etc.), and cloud security (CloudPassage, HyTrust, SkyHigh Networks, etc.). Symantec could also double down on Identity and Access Management by grabbing Courion.

3. Streamline, streamline, streamline. Symantec has been a company with too many products, too many contract types, too many sales teams, etc. In spite of all of this variety and volume, the company's financial success always rides on the back of less than ten products such as backup, endpoint security software, SSL certificates, and email security. Steve Bennett recognized this issue and deserves credit for starting the winnowing process but the next CEO has to put his or her foot on the gas and make the tough decisions. Should Symantec divest Altiris (I would say yes)? Should it back out of the MDM market (ditto)? Should it create separate LOBs for storage and security (tough one but yes again)? Symantec needs to follow a GE-type product matrix strategy by investing in successful and promising product areas and get out of all others.

4. Build a cybersecurity architecture and ecosystem. IBM, McAfee, and Trend Micro are pushing hard to create an integrated cybersecurity architecture for emerging enterprise security requirements. Symantec gets this strategy but is a bit late to the party. To overcome this deficit, Symantec should embrace open standards, invest in enterprise software expertise and services, and become a partner nexus for leading network security vendors like Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet, Juniper, and Palo Alto Networks. To expedite this process, Symantec should become a vocal champion of open source security projects as well as standards from groups like the FIDO Alliance, Mitre, NIST, and TCG.

5. Make Symantec products and services easier to sell and consume. Once again, Steve Bennett was on the right track so the new CEO should follow his lead. Customers don't have the time to negotiate complex contracts or work with a multitude of sales people. Symantec needs to simplify its sales, go-to-market, and contractual processes, and hire top-tier sales people that can work with CIOs and CISOs rather than network administrators. This strategy should also extend to the channel to enable partner success.

6. Establish Symantec as a center-of-excellence for talented employees. While Symantec recruited a number of new executives under Steve Bennett's tenure, it also experienced a serious brain drain of frustrated engineers and managers. For example, Symantec followed a cookie-cutter (and multi-million dollar) plan from Bain, fired a number of senior engineering talent and replaced them with junior people working overseas. This move may have been financially sound but it alienated the engineering community and gave Symantec a bad reputation amongst leading security software engineers. Symantec must emulate Google and establish itself as a center-of-excellence by hiring, supporting, and resourcing the best and brightest who are passionate about making a difference in cybersecurity and data management R&D.

Okay, I may not be qualified to run a multi-billion dollar company, but I've been working with Symantec for over a decade and believe these recommendations could push the company in the right direction. Symantec is a good company with some strong products and dedicated people. Yes, there are hard decisions and difficult times ahead, but I do believe that under the right stewardship, the company could turn around quickly and prosper.###3572||Toyota Motor Corp. has reached a settlement to end a U.S. criminal probe of sudden unexpected acceleration of its vehicles, three people familiar with the matter said.

The settlement, which isn’t final, could be announced as early as Wednesday in the U.S. and will be for $1.2 billion, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the agreement isn’t public.

The carmaker recalled more than 10 million vehicles for problems related to unintended acceleration in 2009 and 2010, starting with a September 2009 announcement that it was recalling 3.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles because of a defect that might cause floor mats to jam accelerator pedals. The company later recalled vehicles over defects involving the pedals themselves.

In addition to the criminal probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office and the New York office of Federal Bureau of Investigation, the recalls led to lawsuits claiming that defects harmed the value of Toyota vehicles or caused accidents leading to death and injury. Toyota settled suits brought by car owners who claimed economic losses for about $1.6 billion.

Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment on the settlement. Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New York, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on it.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Steve Curtis, a Toyota spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Curtis declined to comment on a possible settlement.

The settlement was reported earlier by CNN.###3573||Empty###3574||For the 24 hours to 23:00 GMT, GBP fell 0.26% against the USD and closed at 1.6596, after Ukraine remained firm on its view that the Crimea peninsula would continue to be part of its country, suggesting more friction with Russia.

Additionally, he noted that the Japan’s exports would continue to remain weak as China’s manufacturing sector is slowing and other emerging countries still suffering from economic imbalances.

On the macro front, the Ministry of Finance reported that Japan’s merchandise (total) trade deficit narrowed to ¥800.3 billion in February, from a revised deficit of ¥2791.7 billion recorded in the previous month.

The German measure fell to a six-month low of 46.6 from February’s 55.7, whereas analysts had been expecting a drop to 52.8. A reading above zero indicates optimism.

“In this month’s survey the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts’ economic expectations for Germany,” observes ZEW president Prof. Dr. Clemens Fuest. “Nevertheless, the indicator’s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

ABN Amro Bank economist Aline Schuiling notes that “despite its decline, the ZEW indicator remains well above its long-term average value and at a level consistent with strong growth of the German economy”.

The measure of expert assessment of the current economic situation in Germany climbed 1.3 points to 51.3 points, ZEW reported.

Investor confidence “has been near record levels, and it could have reached a cyclical high,” notes Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet. “It would suggest that the German economy may find it difficult to re-accelerate from here, especially if foreign demand continues to slow down.”

Separately, ZEW’s Eurozone Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell to its lowest reading since December at 61.5 points, down from 68.5 in February and grossly undershooting expectations for 67.3.

The current economic situation indicator climbed 3.5 points to negative 36.7.

In trading so far today, the EUR/GBP has reached its highest point since 27 December at 0.8388, rising for a third consecutive trading day. At press time, the pair is changing hands at 08382, up 0.15 percent from the day’s opening price.

The price action is close to its descending 200-day simple moving average, currently positioned at 0.8394 and which may provide resistance.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due to speak at the Annual Mais Lecture in London at 17:45 UTC today.

Today’s levels of resistance: 0.8390, 0.8415 and 0.8435.

Levels of support: 0.8355, 0.8335 and 0.8310.###3580||Colorado legislative economists on Tuesday predicted that recreational marijuana taxes will bring in only half of what Gov. John Hickenlooper expects they will.

A forecast produced by economists at the nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects taxes on recreational marijuana will generate about $65 million in the fiscal year beginning in July. Hickenlooper’s projection, released last month, expects nearly twice that — $125 million.

The new prediction further adds to the debate over how lucrative first-in-the-nation taxes on recreational marijuana will be for the state’s coffers. In January, tax revenue came in on pace to be far below previous predictions for the last six months of the current fiscal year.

But Legislative Council economist Larson Silbaugh told members of the legislature’s Joint Budget Committee on Tuesday that too many variables — from the low number of stores open, to the high interest in history-making marijuana purchases — make the January numbers unreliable predictors of what’s to come.

“You can basically use that January number to justify any forecast you want,” he said.

Instead, Silbaugh said Legislative Council economists are more pessimistic than the governor’s economists about how many people will stay in the recreational marijuana market long-term. Recreational marijuana costs about 20 percent more than medical marijuana, he said. And that’s before the hefty taxes on recreational marijuana are applied.

Silbaugh said legislative economists believe many people will decide it is more cost-effective to remain medical-marijuana patients. While such patients must pay up front for a doctor’s evaluation and a state registration fee, medical-marijuana purchases are subject only to the state’s general 2.9 percent sales tax.

“We’re not expecting a lot of new marijuana users because of retail marijuana,” Silbaugh said. “And we’re not expecting because of the price differential, many medical marijuana users shifting over to the adult use market.”

For that reason, legislative economists predict Colorado marijuana stores will do more than $750 million in recreational and medical marijuana sales in the coming fiscal year. Hickenlooper’s economists have put that figure at nearly $1 billion.

However much recreational marijuana taxes generate, Hickenlooper has proposed using all of the money to deal with issues related to marijuana legalization — including funding drug treatment and youth drug-use preventions. Lawmakers are considering the proposal.

London - British luxury handbag maker Mulberry on Thursday announced the departure of its chief executive, Frenchman Bruno Guillon, with immediate effect after two years at the helm. The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Davis said in a short statement.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” he added.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

How it Works

Walmart’s video game trade-in program is easy.

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.

Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year

Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned” which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.

Walmart’s Trade-In Continues to Grow In-Store and Online

Walmart’s in-store video game trade-in program builds on its existing trade-in offerings. In-store, customers can trade in tablets and smartphones and apply the trade-in value towards the purchase of a new device. Online at www.walmart.com/gadgetstogiftcards, customers can receive credit for a larger range of products such as MP3 players, cameras and laptops, in addition to smartphones, tablets and video games.

The New York Times reported:

From January until the end of March, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the HealthCare.gov site and administers the Affordable Care Act, will have spent $52 million on paid media, officials said.

That’s an average of $17 million a month on advertising, or $9 per signup if the administration reaches its revised enrollment goal of six million, The Daily Caller pointed out.

Which is still just a small percentage of the estimated $684 million that will be spent overall on publicity, marketing and advertising the Affordable Care Act, according to The Associated Press.

‘Egadsten!’ Pelosi’s daughter does the

unthinkable to Gadsden ‘don’t tread on me’ flag

With ten days left until the deadline, the administration needs an additional one million people to sign up to meet its enrollment goal. Adding to its problems, the critical 18-35 demographic accounts for just 25 percent of the total, compared to original projections of 38.5 percent.

A reality that explains the growing number of unconventional appearances by President Obama to reach young adults.

Obamacare was designed to provide health insurance to the approximately 16 percent of Americans who are uninsured, and any real measure of success will be in accordance to the extent this number is reduced.

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: " After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: " The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."###3588||If you're seeing this message, that means JavaScript has been disabled on your browser.

British financial markets largely followed that pattern although sterling recovered some recent losses before a raft of potentially market-moving news including the government’s annual budget, Bank of England minutes and unemployment data.

Europe’s major stock markets were down as much as a third of one per cent in early trading, following Asian shares lower after the the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.2 per cent.

Underlying worries over China’s financial and property sectors bubbled to the surface, pushing Chinese stocks lower and the yuan to its weakest level in a year through 6.20 per dollar.

This is the first time the yuan has traded more than 1 percent beyond the midpoint set by the central bank after the daily trading band was widened to 2 percent. Global investors’ main focus, however, remain the Fed and Russia.

“I expect gradually the focus to shift away from the tensions between Russia and the West, unless we see actual violence or some type of events other than sanctions that would be seen as an escalation,” Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea in Helsinki, said.

Earlier, pro-Russian units took control of part of a naval base in Ukraine, in the clearest sign so far that Russian soldiers and volunteers who support them had begun to take control of Ukrainian military facilities across the Black Sea peninsula.

Ukraine’s acting defence minister Ihor Tenyukh said shortly after that his country’s forces would not withdraw from Crimea even though Russian president Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty to make it part of Russia.

Later on Wednesday in Washington, the Fed is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus by $10 billion a month for a third time in a row and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.

The moves would represent both continuity at the US central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to indications that recent economic weakness is not solely down to harsh winter weather.

Earlier this monring Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.25 per cent at 6,589 points, Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 per cent at 9,250 points and France’s CAC 40 was down 0.2 per cent at 4,304 points.

The FTSE Eurofirst index of the leading 300 European stocks was flat around 1,305 points.

Reuters###3590||European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi waits for the start of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels, December 16, 2013. — Reuters pic

BRUSSELS, March 20 — EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord today on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy.

Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People’s Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP’s Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the Eurozone’s 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long. — AFP###3591||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox says it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins still remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company says in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said about 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.###3592||Why did this happen?

Turkey in the past blocked access to YouTube, but it is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country and was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government's reputation ahead of local elections this month.

Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings today. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. "I hope this implementation won't last long," he wrote.

Many � although not all � users trying to access the network early today instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation.

Twitter's @policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or "SMS." It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey � a country that is seeking to join the European Union � as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, said his office was obeying court orders. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and said access would be restored when Twitter removes illegal content. "Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet," he said. "We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness."

Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections.

The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.###3594||Empty###3595||From the Tampa Bay Times' Jeff Harrington:

Florida lost 2,600 jobs in January, led by workforce drops in retail, hotels, restaurants and healthcare.

The reversal came even as the state's unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping from an upwardly adjusted 6.3 percent in December to 6.1 percent in January.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is in Orlando this morning, announced the news via a Twitter link to a brief YouTube video. In the clip, he touted that unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since June 2008. But Scott made no mention of the retraction in jobs.

The unemployment rate and jobs numbers don't always mesh, in part because they're drawn from two different surveys. The jobless rate is taken from a household survey measuring people who say they either have a job or are actively looking for one. The jobs number comes from employers.

Colorado’s experience with full legalization is of interest to other states—including Wisconsin—that are considering easing restrictions on the sale of recreational or medical marijuana.

Colorado’s approach to business is far from uniform and not every issue has been addressed. For example, potency of commercially manufactured “edibles”—foods and beverages infused with THC—doesn’t match product labels, according to lab analyses commissioned by The Denver Post .

Entrepreneurs smell opportunity and confront roadblocks, particularly in opening members-only social clubs for pot smoking.

Dispensaries have multiple personalities. The reception area at LoDo Wellness looks like a homey living room, good for lounging, with a window view of pot plants growing under greenhouse lights. In contrast, the narrowness of Good Chemistry, near Colorado’s State Capitol, provides little room or opportunity for gawking. Healing House, near the University of Denver, displays merchandise like fine jewelry, stretched beneath glass countertops. The 3D Cannabis Center, a warehouse not far from Denver Coliseum, was closed on a weekday afternoon, without explanation.

Tourism offices, for now, take a hands-off approach to pot tourism. That means no comprehensive guides (or vetting process) for pot-friendly lodging, tours or nightlife.

One thing is certain: Colorado collected about $2 million in taxes from $14 million in recreational pot sales during January, and optimists say it’s the birth of a billion-dollar industry.

“In progressive precincts, pot is becoming a fixture of polite society,” asserts party planner Jane West of Denver’s Edible Events during a recent interview with TV journalist Harry Smith. “We’re changing the face of what a cannabis consumer looks like.”

Here are a few things mile-high travelers will want to know.

How will I know where pot is being sold?

Consult weedmaps.com, which shows sales outlets throughout the U.S. Only Colorado allows shops for recreational use. That changes this spring, when rec shops open in the state of Washington.

How can I compare prices and get the word on quality?

Check ads and product reviews in alternative weekly newspapers: Westword (westword.com) in Denver, the Boulder Weekly (boulderweekly.com) and Colorado Springs Independent (csindy.com). The Denver Post ’s marijuana editor manages thecannabist.com.

Can you buy it in Colorado cafés, as is done in Amsterdam?

No. Only licensed dispensaries sell cannabis products legally, but you can’t light up or snack on edibles there. Similarly, you can’t buy a pot-infused dessert at a restaurant, but sometimes events invite attendees to BYOC (Bring Your Own Cannabis). Edible Events organizes high-end functions.

Must I be a Colorado resident?

No, but how much you can purchase for recreational purposes is dictated by residency. A Colorado resident can buy one ounce. A non-resident’s limit is one-fourth of an ounce.

Sales typically are for one-eighth ounce. Prices are all over the place, depending upon the strain, and can be twice as expensive for rec users vs. medical patients. Ads for a $15 eighth are likely not for tourists.

We saw joints priced at $8 to $15, and online averages of $40 or $45 for an eighth.

Do I need a prescription to buy?

No, but you must be at least 21 and flash a government-issued photo I.D. to get into rec dispensaries.

Forget about seeing a medically licensed dispensary unless you can slide a state-issued “red card”—medical marijuana card—through a security window.

When a dispensary is licensed both ways, you’ll only shop in the rec area. Medical patients may possess two ounces of pot—or more, depending on what their docs recommend—and purchases aren’t taxed as high. Being a medical marijuana patient also is the only way for those under 21 to legally buy pot products. Approved conditions for medical marijuana use include cancer, glaucoma, HIV or a chronic/debilitating condition with severe pain, nausea, spasms or seizures.

Must I use cash?

It depends upon the dispensary. Ask before shopping. Some have an ATM.

Where can I smoke?

Not in public view. Not while driving. Not on ski slopes. Not in most hotel rooms; state law says at least 75% per property must be smoke-free. Some hotels are entirely smoke-free, so check before making assumptions.

Some music venues, like Quixote’s True Blue in Denver, have a concealed outdoor patio for smoking. Good for Deadheads.

I don’t smoke, so what kind of pot-infused alternatives can I enjoy?

Packaged brownies, chocolate-dipped pretzels, hard candy, gummies, spiked punches—you name it. The range of products depends upon the dispensary, and it pays to compare prices, but few tip their hand online.

Product potency might be lots higher than you’d expect, especially if you haven’t indulged for decades.

Edibles with 100 mg of THC seem typical, and bud tenders advise starting with one-fourth of whatever you buy, then waiting at least 30 minutes before deciding whether to nibble more.

A single Love’s Oven oatmeal cookie with 100 mg of THC cost $25 (plus tax) at The Healing House, and the same potency in Dr. J’s Flying Aces hard candy cost $18. Good Chemistry’s thumb-wide chocolate-caramel cups from Mountain Medicine sell for $10.

How will I know if what I’m buying is any good?

Talk frankly to a “bud tender”—dispensary sales staffer—about how you define “good.” Much depends upon expectations, and bud tenders should be knowledgeable about their strains of products and effects.

If you don’t feel comfortable with the answers, find another dispensary. There’s no obligation to buy.

Are there any consumer protections? Or regulations?

This isn’t dark-alley dealing—a sales license is required. Although it’s OK to share small amounts of stash if no money is exchanged, personal sales of marijuana remain illegal.

Whatever is bought from a dispensary is labeled with great detail. Each product can be traced back to a specific grower and plant.

To complain, contact the confidential tip line of Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division at 855-277-7500 or file online with the state’s Consumer Protection Section (coloradoattorneygeneral.gov).

How are police dealing with stoned drivers? Is it a problem?

It is illegal to drive under the influence. You can get a DUI with a minimum of five nanograms (five billionths of a gram) of THC per milliliter of blood. That’s “just a few hits off a joint,” concludes weedmaps.com.

A $1 million television ad campaign, to remind people not drive stoned, began this month after Colorado State Patrol reported 31 of 61 impaired motorists in January were detained because of marijuana.

“Drive high, get a DUI” is the slogan, and ads use humor to make their point.

Can I drive to Colorado, load up my car with pot, and leave?

We have no evidence of border patrols, but transporting cannabis or products containing it across state lines is illegal. As a federal offense, maximum punishment is one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Depending on your route home, penalties could be more severe: Get nabbed in Nebraska with more than one pound, for example, and max consequences are five years and $10,000. More details at norml.org.###3599||Why did this happen?

The latest possible lead came as the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace found of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people on board.

The new potential sighting was dramatically announced by Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, after he was handed a note with details during a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, scooping the official announcement from China.

"Chinese ships have been dispatched to the area," Hishammuddin told reporters.

China said the object was 22 metres long (74ft) and 13 metres (43ft) wide, and spotted around 120 km (75 miles) "south by west" of potential debris reported by Australia off its west coast in the forbidding waters of the southern Indian Ocean.

The image was captured by the high-definition Earth observation satellite "Gaofen-1" early on March 18, two days after the Australian satellite picture was taken, China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) said on its website.

It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search for the plane said.

The wing of a Boeing 777-200ER is approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base, according to estimates derived from publicly available scale drawings. Its fuselage is 63.7 metres long by 6.2 metres wide.

Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing.

Investigators believe someone on board shut off the plane's communications systems, and partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and re-crossing the Malay Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

That has led them to focus on hijacking or sabotage, but they have not ruled out technical problems.

REMOTE SEAS

Since Australia announced the first image of what could be parts of the aircraft on Thursday, the international search for the plane has focused on an expanse of ocean more than 2,000 km (1,200 miles) southwest of Perth.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said one of its aircraft reported sighting a number of "small objects" with the naked eye, including a wooden pallet, within a radius of 5 km.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion aircraft took a closer look but only reported seeing clumps of seaweed. It dropped a marker buoy to track the movement.

"A merchant ship in the area has been tasked to relocate and seek to identify the material," AMSA said in a statement.

The search area experienced good weather conditions on Saturday with visibility of around 10 km and moderate seas.

Australia, which is coordinating the rescue, has cautioned the objects in the satellite image might be a lost shipping container or other debris, and may have sunk since the picture was taken.

"Even though this is not a definite lead, it is probably more solid than any other lead around the world and that is why so much effort and interest is being put into this search," Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters, before latest Chinese image was reported.

China said its icebreaker "Snow Dragon" was heading for the area, but was still around 70 hours away. Japan and India were also sending more planes and Australian and Chinese navy vessels were steaming towards the southern search zone.

But the area is known for rough seas and strong currents, and Malaysia's Hishammuddin said a cyclone warning had been declared for Christmas Island, far off to the north.

"There are vessels heading in that direction. They may have to go through the cyclone," he said.

"Generally, conditions in the southern corridor are very challenging," said Hishammuddin. "The ocean varies between 1,150 metres and 7,000 metres in depth."

NO SIGN IN NORTHERN CORRIDOR

Where the missing plane went after it flew out of range of Malaysia's military radar off the country's northwest coast has been one of the most puzzling aspects of what has quickly become perhaps the biggest mystery in modern aviation history.

Electronic "pings" detected by a commercial satellite suggested it flew for another six hours or so, but could do no better than place its final signal on one of two vast arcs: a northern corridor from Laos to the Caspian Sea, and a southern one stretching from Indonesia down to the part of the Indian Ocean that has become the focal point of the search.

Malaysia has said the search will continue in both corridors until confirmed debris is found.

Hishammuddin said that, in response to a formal diplomatic request from Malaysia, China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan had all said, based on preliminary analysis, that there have been no sightings of the aircraft on their radar.

Aircraft and ships have renewed the search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas in the northern corridor that have already been exhaustively swept.

The Pentagon said it was considering a request from Malaysia for sonar equipment. The P-8 and P-3 spy planes, which the United States is already deploying in the search, also carry "sonobuoys" that are dropped into the sea and use sonar signals to search the waters below.

The search itself has strained ties between China and Malaysia, with Beijing repeatedly leaning on the Southeast Asian nation to step up its hunt and do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers.

For families of the passengers, the process has proved to be an emotionally wrenching battle to elicit information.

In a statement on Saturday, relatives in Beijing lambasted a Malaysian delegation for "concealing the truth" and "making fools" out of the families after they said they left a meeting without answering all their questions.

"This kind of conduct neglects the lives of all the passengers, shows contempt for all their families, and even more, tramples on the dignity of Chinese people and the Chinese government," they said.

Some experts have argued that the reluctance to share sensitive radar data and capabilities in a region fraught with suspicion amid China's military rise and territorial disputes may have hampered the search.

Prime minister Recep Tayyib Erdogan said on Thursday before the Twitter blackout that the government now had a court order. Erdogan's government has been rocked by revelations of a scandal in social media. Erdogan declared that Turkey would eradicate Twitter and he did not care what the international community said. He added, everyone would witness the power of the Turkish Republic. Erdogan's showdown with Twitter had long been coming. In mid-2013, thousands protested against a proposed urban development of Istanbul's Taksim Gezi Park, but many said the discontent was more rooted in the government's shift away from secularism and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression. As in many countries, social media was instrumental in rallying the protesters, which included as many as 3.5 million people in a nation of 81 million. Outraged by the growing opposition to his administration, Erdogan called all social media the ''worst menace to society.'' Over the last few months, with the approaching elections social media Erdogan had become increasingly resentful and intolerant of social media. The fact, however remains that Erdogan, who doesn't follow anyone, has 4.17 million Twitter followers and has unleashed 3,043 tweets. Two weeks ago, following the release of recordings which showed someone sounding like Erdogan telling his son to dispose of a large sum of cash, the prime minister's patience snapped. Calling the recordings a ''fabrication'' he ultimately blamed social media. Turkey had in the past blocked access to YouTube, but this comes as the first ban on Twitter, which was instrumental in organising flash protests against the government last year. A lawyers' association, has meanwhile, asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. The country's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation of the court order. European Commission vice president Neelie Kroes criticised the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that was seeking to join the EU as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, voiced concern over the development. According to Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, his office was merely obeying court orders. The social network had been accused of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and he said access would be restored only when Twitter removed illegal content. He said Turkey was not a country that banned the internet.







###3602||NEW YORK � Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart stores for store credit but not cash. The credit can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

''Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,'' said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that Wal-Mart works with on its trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy offer used video trade in programs, but the Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

Wal-Mart made a point of saying that credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with ''modest'' success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

''History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,'' he wrote in a client note.

Wal-Mart shares rose 23 cents to $74.92 in morning trading.###3603||Mt. Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange, says it has found 200,000 of the 850,000 bitcoins that had gone missing and precipitated its bankruptcy in February.

In a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website, CEO Mark Karpeles said the company scanned “certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins.”

But lo and behold, the company found the equivalent of $115 million!

Bitcoins are a virtual currency that only exist as lines of code, stored on anything from cloud servers to thumb drives. These so-called wallets can be hacked, or users can simply misplace them or forget their passwords.

Mt. Gox, which started as a site for trading Magic: The Gathering playing cards, was later transformed into a bitcoin exchange and was at one time the largest such online service. In late February, however, the company announced it had lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins over several months, most likely due to theft from hackers. Of the 850,000 lost bitcoins, only 100,000 were the company’s own holdings. The vast majority was virtual currency belonging to users.

Some 650,000 bitcoins remain missing. That’s the equivalent of almost $400 million, depending on what the volatile exchange rate may be. One bitcoin currently trades for $575.

A lot of people are just pleased that these companies are being weeded out

Although the thefts at Mt. Gox and several other exchanges in recent months have reinforced a negative impression of Bitcoin, people within the crypto-currency community still overwhelmingly believe in the security of digital cash.

“Any news about bitcoin companies being hacked and people’s funds being stolen is obviously terrible, but a lot of people are just pleased that these companies – the ones with out adequate security or decent management – are being weeded out,” Emily Spaven, Managing Editor at digital currency news and information site CoinDesk, told me in an email earlier this month.

“The collapse of the bad actors enables other companies to learn from their mistakes and build systems that are stronger and more secure.”

Karpeles, in particular, had gained a reputation as a feckless manager who was lax about security as head of Mt. Gox. As Wired reports, important bug fixes would sometimes languish for weeks before they were implemented. For much of the last year Karpeles was also obsessed with building a “Bitcoin Cafe” in the lobby of the company’s Tokyo office building — an expensive and time-consuming project that never launched.

Esther Tung, a Vancouver-based bitcoin consultant, recently attended a digital currency conference in Austin, Texas, and found the mood was overwhelmingly positive about the future. This despite all the bad press, which included the circus surrounding the identity of bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.

“Most people think it’s a really good thing that Mt. Gox has gone away and declared bankruptcy and shut down. They weren’t good for the market,” she said.

Tung, co-founder of Saftonhouse Consulting Group, says the huge losses at Mt. Gox have only two possible explanations: “They were either incompetent or it was an inside job.”

The used video game market is huge for Gamestop, as it has dominated the space for the past 15 years, returning $1 billion in trade-in credits to customers just last year. Used games accounts for 30% of Gamestop’s annual sales, and nearly 40% of its profits. With Walmart setting its sights on this lucrative business, Gamestop fans are hoping it won’t be "GAME OVER" for the video game purveyor.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida's unemployment rate dropped slightly in January, although the actual number of jobs actually shrank, according to new data released Monday.



The mixed results did not stop Gov. Rick Scott from touting the latest numbers as he focused on the steady recovery of the state's economy.



"It is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," Scott said in a statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow."



Scott has made the rebound in the state's economy a centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. He has noted in campaign speeches that the unemployment rate increased under former Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist, who is now a Democrat and challenging Scott, has said Florida suffered because of the economic downturn that affected most of the nation and world.



The state's unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, which was lower than it was at the end of the year. The rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.



There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.



Despite the overall rate dropping slightly by 0.2 percent, the overall number of jobs in the state dropped by 2,600. The number of jobs is calculated using a separate survey.



Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, noted the decline to jobs to blast Scott for "desperately attempting to take credit for a recovery that's more anemic than what the economy was already predicted to do on its own."



Florida overall has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida trailed Texas and California.



Scott has said the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies, including his push to cut back on regulation and lower taxes.



But economists who work for the Florida Legislature have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or delayed their job search. A state economic overview released in February concluded that if the number of people in the labor force had held steady since December 2011, the real unemployment rate would be 7.9 percent.



Monroe County in the southern end of the state had the state's lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, followed by Walton County in the Panhandle at 4.2 percent. Hendry County, in the southern interior, had the highest unemployment rate at 9.8 percent, followed by Flagler County in northeast Florida at 9.3 percent.###3609||Empty###3610||You are using an older browser version.

Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

Follow Patrick on Twitter###3612||Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has had it in for Twitter ever since a stream of damaging leaks alleging widespread corruption in his inner circle spread via the social network.

Things got more restrictive back in February, as the Turkish parliament passed a bill designed to tighten control of the Internet, allowing blocks of websites deemed offensive.

On Thursday, the hammer fell, with Erdoğan promising to "wipe out Twitter," claiming "They will see the Turkish republic's strength."

As of last night, the hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey, #TurkeyblockedTwitter and #OccupyTwitter were trending worldwide.

So here's how the Turkish people can show Erdoğan a little strength of their own, and keep the tweets twittering on in the Republic.

1. Tweet through SMS

That's right: the over-zealous censors in Turkey's government haven't thought of this one. For the time being, Turkish users wondering how to access Twitter in Turkey can send tweets via their mobile network.

Twitter's Policy account tweeted last night:

Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555.

This is certainly a good option for Turkish users trying to access Twitter, but some users have voiced worries that this could lead to authorities tracking down individual users and taking action against them.

For the time being, it's probably best not to tweet anything too inflammatory using this method, as remember it will tie your Twitter handle to your phone contract and identity.

Which brings us on to...

2. Changing DNS

To the amusement of many online, the Turkish government is using a simple Domain Name System (DNS) block to black out Twitter.

DNS Blocking is a strategy for making it difficult for users to locate specific domains or web sites on the Internet. It was first introduced in 1997 as a means to block spam email from known IP addresses. Your Internet service provider (ISP) simply sees that you're trying to connect to Twitter and refuses to serve you, possibly redirecting you to another page.

The solution is simple in this case: change your DNS. There are many different options for DNS solutions, some paid-for, some free. Your best bet in our view is to use a free solution like Google DNS or OpenDNS.

Turkish users: try some of these out and let us know how much success you have!

Update: As of Saturday, the Turkish government has also blocked Google DNS. OpenDNS appears to still be working.

3. Use a VPN

Another solution is to use a VPN connection.

Setting up a VPN usually requires shelling out a little cash, however there are a number of free options.

Check out our recent list of the best free-to-use VPN providers out there.

But be careful: people should be cautious when using free VPNs. They can be unreliable, or in some cases, contain malicious software. Make sure to scan any downloaded files with leading antivirus software, and check around on forums for malware warnings before downloading anything you don't 100 per cent trust.

That's not all, though: whatever free VPN product you may consider, bear in mind that there are a few caveats. While most free VPN software employs some sort of security for the data connection, you certainly aren't getting the security strength of paid and business VPN products. So if you're doing anything that might get you in trouble, you might want to consider our final option...

Update: The most popular choice so far has been Hotspot Shield, a free VPN service that at the time of writing is being downloaded 270,000 times a day in Turkey.

4. The deep web (TOR)

That's right: the favoured haven of terrorists, drug dealers and illegal pornographers could actually be your most effective weapon in the fight against Internet censorship in Turkey.

This open source tool was born as a US Navy project, but now it's used by all kinds of people worldwide, including the hacktivist group Anonymous.

When you surf through TOR, your browser's data requests take a circuitous route through randomly-chosen TOR servers. All traffic is encrypted except the final connection from a TOR server to the actual website. Anyone intercepting a packet along the way won't learn anything about you or the destination website.

* Banks very cautious after getting into sanctions trouble in the past (Adds Bombardier’s doubts over deal with Russia’s Rostec)

By Eric Matzen and Michelle Martin

COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT, March 21 (Reuters) - A deepening economic standoff between Russia and the West over the future of Ukraine has rippled through trading floors and boardrooms, with exporters scrambling to protect revenues and some global financial firms halting services.

U.S. President Barack Obama’s threat to target major sections of the Russian economy should President Vladimir Putin follow up his annexation of Crimea with further incursions in Ukraine has caused alarm in Europe.

Denmark’s foreign ministry held a special briefing for about 130 companies, including drugs firm Novo Nordisk and brewer Carlsberg on Friday after being inundated with inquiries about the business implications of the crisis.

In an email to Reuters, Carlsberg’s chief executive said he was monitoring the situation closely and would act if sanctions had a direct impact on his drinks group’s business. The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia.

“Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems,” said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. “Our focus is on our employees and our breweries.”

Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop-off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price.

With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the West’s sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked.

Profine, a plastic windowframe manufacturer with annual revenues of 700 million euros ($965 million), has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won’t be able to do that forever.

“If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners,” said Peter Mrosik, the German firm’s managing partner.

In Canada, Bombardier Inc said the airplane maker’s planned joint-venture with Rostec, the Russian state-owned industrial and defense conglomerate, was likely to be delayed because of sanctions being considered by Canada and other Western countries. A related deal for Bombardier to sell 100 short-haul Q400 NextGen aircraft was also likely to be held up.

Obama unveiled sanctions against members of Putin’s inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally.

In response, Visa and MasterCard, both based in the United States, stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Obama’s list.

Western Union Co, the world’s largest money transfer company, said it had suspended services through Bank Rossiya branches but was continuing services at more than 20,000 locations and self-service terminals in Russia.

SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets. Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran.

COSMETIC SO FAR

What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.

In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.

Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance as an energy exporter.

“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.

“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.

State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.

“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side,” said a Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia,” the banker added.

WAIT AND SEE

Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.

Since the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.

Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.

Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.

“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

That’s a market value higher than some established hotel and lodging companies including Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide.

TPG Capital Management is expected to lead the funding. TPG also has an investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another dominant player in the sector known as the “sharing economy”.

Airbnb has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-up companies in the five years since it was founded by graduates from Harvard and Rhode Island School of Design.

But its business model has attracted attention from authorities.

The company is involved in a legal fight with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has subpoenaed Airbnb for information to try to determine if any of its customers are violating New York state laws.

New York state does not allow renters to sublet their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present.

And the San Francisco city attorney's office has also queried the type of short-term rentals offered by Airbnb following claims that Airbnb rentals take away supply from the rented housing and drive up rents.###3618||Empty###3619||###3620||###3621||Why did this happen?

Designs on pushing Mulberry upmarket have received a setback with the resignation of its chief executive only two years after he was appointed.

The sudden exit of Bruno Guillon, coming after a string of profit warnings and a collapse in the designer’s share price, leaves Mulberry with two key positions vacant.

The Somerset-based company has been without a creative designer for six months and cancelled its show at London Fashion Week.

Investors reacted positively to Mr Guillon’s departure, however, and the shares closed 33½p, or 5.26 per cent, higher at 670p. Paddy Power, the bookmaker, has installed LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, as the favourite to buy the company this year.

"The ruling party elected by the people has no right to take such an action," he added.

Access was blocked a few hours after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a statement about such a possibility.

He has recently said that if necessary, the agenda may include the issue of banning the use of Youtube and Facebook to protect its citizens from external influences. However Turkish President Abdullah Gul stressed the impossibility of banning their use.

The Turkish President also said that a complete ban on Twitter is out of the question.

This is a second Symantec CEO that has been fired in less than two years.

Via the Wall Street Journal:

Mr. Bennett had been CEO since July 2012, when he replaced Enrique Salem. A former General Electric Co. executive and Intuit Inc. chief executive, Mr. Bennett had initially joined Symantec as chairman. He aimed to retool Symantec to compete with a new generation of cybersecurity companies. But Mr. Bennett, 60 years old, couldn’t reverse falling revenues and hadn’t yet delivered on new products, former employees and a person close to the board said.

SYMC board member Michael Brown will take over as interim CEO until a replacement is found, the company said.

The computer security company that is known for its anti-virus software work has suffered declining revenue in recent months — down for the last two quarters.

At the end of December, Symantec revenue fell 4.8% to $1.7 billion though income rose 31%, in large part due to the company’s cost cutting.

Symantec said revenue in the current quarter would be $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, down from $1.75 billion last year.

SYMC stock is down 12% in early morning trading, but had been down 15% from last year prior to the news.###3628||Oracle said Tuesday its fiscal third-quarter net income rose 2 per cent, helped by higher cloud software subscription revenue, but investors wanted more growth and the company's stock fell in late trading.



For the three months through February 28, the business software maker earned $2.57 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $2.5 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the same quarter the year before. Excluding one-time items, the company posted an adjusted profit of 68 cents per share.



Revenue rose 4 per cent, to $9.31 billion from $8.96 billion.



Analysts polled by FactSet expected a profit of 70 cents per share on $9.36 billion in revenue.





Revenue from new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions increased 4 per cent to $2.42 billion, as bookings for the company's cloud applications jumped more than 60 per cent. Revenue from software license updates and product support rose 5 per cent to $4.56 billion. Shares of Redwood Shores, California-based Oracle Corp. fell $1.70, or 4.4 per cent, to $37.14 in aftermarket trading. The stock has gained 7.8 per cent over the past 12 months.###3629||Empty###3630||Anti-virus software maker Corp. ( ) reached a new 52-week low today after the company said it has fired president and CEO Steve Bennett from his role, after less than two years on the job, and has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim chief, effectively immediately.

Bennett's axing follows earnings disappointments, share losses and a series of executive departures last autumn. Bennett also resigned from the board of directors.

The company said it would immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive recruitment firm.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to , including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement late Thursday announcing the news.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for 's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

Schulman said the company's priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage the company's assets and team to drive the next stage of 's growth.

He highlighted that the termination was not "precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Interim CEO Brown joined the company's board following its merger with Veritas Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive of Quantum Corp during a time when that company doubled in revenues to $6 billion.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market," said Brown in the release.

"By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage 's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

also reiterated its guidance for the fourth quarter, previously announced in January. It said it expects revenue of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, compared to $1.748 billion in the year-ago period, on adjusted earnings per share between 40 and 42 cents, down from 44 cents.

Shares of the company were lately down 12.75% to C$18.25, sinking to as low as $17.95 earlier in the session.###3631||Symantec has fired its CEO as it looks for fresh leadership to try and lead the company, which has been hit by the ongoing declines in the PC market, making it the second time in two years it has parted company with its top executive.

Symantec announced the end of Steve Bennett's time as CEO with board member Michael Brown taking over as interim president and CEO immediately with the vendor kicking off the search for a full-time replacement.

Bennett had been in the role less than two years after coming in to replace another short term boss Enrique Salem, who left in 2012 after just three years in the job because he had not managed to improve the performance at the firm.

The decision to part with Bennett was described by the vendor as something that had come about after a review of the situation rather than a knee jerk reaction to the most recent set of financial results, which showed that the business was still struggling with a 5% decline in revenues for its third quarter.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said Symantec board chairman Daniel Schulman.

Under Bennett's leadership the firm underwentseveral major changes to improve its fortunes, including making revisions to its partner programmes, making changes to the sales team, splitting into renewals and new business and changing the direct sales outfit to focus on information management or security.

The firm followed that up by taking the wraps off a global channel strategy last November that was based around reseller competencies rewarding those that delivered value to customers by developing their skills.

Schulman said that Bennett had made some positive changes to the way the vendor operated, improving efficiencies and reducing costs but it had to bring on board someone who could improve its fortunes.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth," he said.###3632||LOS ANGELES (CBS/AP) — The “Every Day Low Price” king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Walmart has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form of store credit.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

“You can think of the app as a post-purchase ad match. We are really making it easy in that you don’t have to look through those circulars anymore, you don’t have to know what’s on sale at another retailer,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.

Asked why Walmart doesn’t just implement the lowest price right away, Blakeman said, “This tool is in place for the chance that there is a lower advertised price out there.”

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on http://www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt.

Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. For example, in Atlanta, Walmart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General.

Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. They can redeem in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Cal State San Bernardino Marketing Professor Victoria Seitz warned consumers there’s a price to be paid for using an app like this.

“That price is your privacy. They’re going to know about your shopping habits,” she said.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart said it wants to see how competitors and customers respond to the program, but it doesn’t have any plans to add online stores to the test.

The accolade from US business ethics think-tank the Ethisphere Institute makes Connor is one of only a few Asia based companies to receive the award - and the only sourcing company in the world to be included on the list.

The award recognises organisations that continue to raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior, with the evaluation process covering everything from codes of ethics, litigation and business practices to the firm's impact on local communities, along with feedback from customers and employees.

Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance programme (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

"We have certainly been experiencing increased interest from clients based on their desire to be ethically compliant, which makes me very proud of what we have achieved as a business," explains Connor's chairman and CEO, William E (Chip) Connor.

Connor's success is based on a business model that enables brands, retailers and importers to source apparel and homewares from a global supply base of over 6,000 audited factories.

However, the company does not hold an equity interest in any factory, nor receive any financial benefit from factories. Instead, Connor puts together a portfolio of options providing details of different factories, prices, technical evaluations, spec packs, quality assurance and a vendor scorecard so that customers can make their own decisions. The sourcing firm's earnings are generated only from client commissions, based on the value of products delivered.

Connor also prides itself on high volume, long-term relationships with customers such as US retailer Dillards, with which it has been working for 42 years, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer (also recognised by Ethisphere), which has been a client for 17 years.

Other apparel firms included on the 2014 list of the world's most ethical companies are Gap Inc, Levi Strauss & Co and Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M).###3634||Please enable Javascript to watch this video

DENVER -- Two bills signed into law Monday aim to protect Colorado children from recreational marijuana.

"Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, before signing the bills into law. "Every neuroscientist I've talked to has talked about the possibility this could have long-term effects on a child's brain."

One proposal seeks to reduce the number of accidental ingestions of edible marijuana by young children who, for instance, confuse pot brownies for candy; and it also looks to limit the ability of older children to purchase recreational marijuana using a fake ID.

House Bill 1122, which requires all edible marijuana to be sold in opaque, child-proof packaging and also empowers pot retailers to confiscate suspected fake IDs like liquor store owners can, passed both the House and Senate unanimously.

"We had the marijuana industry, we had the medical profession, we had law enforcement, we had Republicans, we had Democrats all come together to say 'how can we fix these problems?'" said Rep. Daniel Kagan, D-Denver, the bill's House sponsor.

The proposal also specifies that marijuana that is grown in a home with people under 21 must be enclosed and locked.

"We have seen increased visits to the ER and urgent care clinics because kids are accidentally ingesting marijuana," said Sen. Linda Newell, D-Littleton, the senate sponsor.

"This new law goes a long way to ensuring that we’re taking steps to keep kids safe."

The new laws take effect immediately.###3635||Reuters

Such sanctions should primarily target Mr. Putin’s inner circle, the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation’s wealth, including Gennady N. Timchenko, head of the Volga Group; Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, influential businessmen and former judo sparring partners of Mr. Putin; Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a financier believed to be Mr. Putin’s banker; Vladimir I. Yakunin, president of Russian Railways; the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively.

Apparently the call to action was heard, and the US is attempting to ratchet up pressure on Putin’s real inner circle. Today, some but not all of these names—Timchenko, the Rotenbergs, Kovalchuk, and Yakunin—have been added to the list of people who cannot travel or transact business in the United States. A spokesman for Timchenko’s oil-trading firm, Gunvor, told Quartz “it is clear no due diligence was performed to support this accusation,” and said that Putin has never been a beneficiary of the firm or its activities.

Kovalchuk’s financial institution, Bank Rossiya, also made the list. Mark Dubowitz, one of the architects of the Obama administration’s Iran sanctions, recently told Quartz that crippling a single Russian financial institution by cutting it off from international transactions would be a key symbol—”the ‘kill the chicken to scare the monkeys’ theory of financial sanctions.” NPR’s former Moscow correspondent, Gregory Feifer, describes Bank Rossiya, the chicken in question, in his recent book:

The deeply obscure but hugely powerful Bank Rossiya … has been accused of using secret offshore companies to channel state loans intended for the acquisition of a jaw-dropping collection of Gazprom assets. Former bank insiders have said shady privatizations of companies such as Gazporm’s Sogaz insurance firm enabled Bank Rossiya to suck billions of dollars’ worth of value from the parent company. Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who is a keen observer of the hidden aspects of Russia’s economy, says the Putin circle’s “sheer asset-stripping” includes huge capital expenditures—$52 billion in 2011—on pipelines and other projects that cost far more than they would in other countries because much of the money is skimmed off.

The logic behind the sanctions is to squeeze the people who have benefitted from Putin’s reign. That is likely to be more effective than sanctioning Russian politicians who may not even have international financial interests. But by holding off on sanctioning Usmanov and the leaders of Russia’s two state-controlled oil firms, the US might be once again failing to send a strong enough message. Either that, or leaving itself room to escalate.###3642||You are using an older browser version.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it's also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well," Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers."

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer's $55 used version.

"You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing," Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular "Gears of War" franchise, said last year###3650||On March 20, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told his parliament that objects had been spotted in waters hundreds of kilometres off the western Australian coast. Further searches, by Australian, New Zealand and US planes, were needed to find out if they were part of the missing plane.

Others have speculated that the pilot or co-pilot may have intentionally crashed the plane. The FBI is trying to restore deleted simulator-flights from Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah's computer – but these could be innocuous. Critics of the crash theory say neither the pilot nor co-pilot had ever expressed any kind of radical sentiment or displayed mental issues, and both possessed adequate flying experience.

Theories abound. Fellow pilot Chris Goodfellow has suggested that a tyre may have caught fire, causing the pilots to turn towards the closest suitable airport, with the rapid ascent and descent perhaps representing an attempt to extinguish the fire. Critics of this theory have pointed out that the change in path was programmed into the plane's computer 12 minutes before the calm toned "good night" transmission, suggesting the change in course was planned.

At 1.30am, on point 4, the plane is spotted for the last time on civilian radar. At 2.15am, on point 5, military radar spots it, although it is not clear at the time that this was MH370. Satellite data suggests the plane could also have angled towards point 6.

Forensic experts examining the home flight simulator of Malaysia Airlines pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah have found nothing suspicious, collapsing the only significant lead investigators have been pursuing to try to solve the mystery disappearance of MH370, police sources say.

Investigators became suspicious last week when they discovered Zaharie, 53, had deleted logs on a computer linked to the simulator on February 3, almost five weeks before the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board inexplicably turned around during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and was still flying more than seven hours later.

The computer hard drive was sent to FBI experts in the US to search for evidence of some kind of hijacking plot.

Zaharie and his co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, have been a key focus of investigations after Malaysian authorities said they believed a “deliberate action” by someone on board caused the plane to lose communications and then turn around from its scheduled flight path.

Intensive scrutiny of Zaharie’s background has failed uncover any links to extremists groups or terrorism.

Investigations have also failed to find anything suspicious in the background of Fariq, who was due soon to marry another pilot.

Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein was expected to announce that police had found nothing suspicious on the simulator at a media briefing in Kuala Lumpur late on Saturday, Malaysian time.

Australia has cautioned that their investigations in the southern Indian Ocean remained a tentative one.



Officials are bracing for the "long haul" as searches by more than two dozen countries turn up little but frustration and fresh questions about Flight MH370 which vanished on a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8.



Six aircraft and two merchant ships are now scouring an area of the remote southern Indian Ocean where suspected debris was spotted by satellite earlier this week.



Australia, which announced the potential find and is coordinating the rescue, has cautioned the objects might be a lost shipping container or other debris.



"Even though this is not a definite lead, it is probably more solid than any other lead around the world and that is why so much effort and interest is being put into this search," acting Australian Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters at a Perth airforce base.



China, Japan and India are sending more planes and Australian and Chinese navy vessels are also steaming towards the zone, more than 2,000km southwest of Perth.



Weather conditions are good, with 10 km of visibility, according to search officials - a crucial boost for a search that is relying more on human eyes than the technical wizardry of the most advanced aircraft in the world.



"While these aircraft are equipped with very advanced technology, much of this search is actually visual," said Truss, who also warned that the objects detected by satellites may now be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.



"It is a very remote area, but we intend to continue the search until we are absolutely satisfied that further searching would be futile, and that day is not in sight," he said.



Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman John Young said the operation was still considered search and rescue.



"The plan is we want to find these objects because they are the best lead to where we might find people to be rescued," he said.



CLOCK TICKING



Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said searchers were facing the "long haul" but were conscious that the clock was ticking. The plane's "black box" voice and data recorder only transmits an electronic signal for about 30 days before its battery dies, after which it will be far more difficult to locate.



Aircraft and ships have also renewed the search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas that have already been exhaustively swept to find some clue to unlock one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation.



Investigators suspect the Boeing 777, which took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing shortly after midnight on March 8, was deliberately diverted thousands of miles from its scheduled path. They say they are focusing on hijacking or sabotage but have not ruled out technical problems.



The Telegraph newspaper published what it said was a transcript of communications between the cockpit of Flight MH370 and Malaysian air control, but few if any new clues emerged.



The search itself has strained ties between China and Malaysia, with Beijing repeatedly leaning on the Southeast Asian nation to step up its hunt and do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers.



For families of the passengers, the process has proved to be an emotionally wrenching battle to elicit information, their angst fuelled by a steady stream of speculation and false leads.



Some experts have argued that the reluctance to share sensitive radar data and capabilities in a region fraught with suspicion amid China's military rise and territorial disputes may have hampered the search.



Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been slowed in some cases by delays over the paperwork to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.



Truss said he was grateful for the search craft offered by China and others, which are expected to arrive at the Australian airforce base on Saturday.



Australian rescue coordinators said they are awaiting confirmation of the planes and ships offered before they are included in any search schedules.

RALEIGH — North Carolina’s unemployment rate for January decreased from the month before and from last January, according to the Employment Security Commission.

The state’s seasonally adjusted January jobless rate was 6.7 percent, decreasing 0.2 of a percent from December’s revised rate of 6.9 percent. The national rate decreased to 6.6 percent from December’s 6.7 percent.

North Carolina’s January 2014 unemployment rate was 2.1 percentage points lower than a year ago. The number of people employed increased 17,407 over the month to 4,356,090, and increased 45,283 over the year. The number of people unemployed decreased 11,354 over the month to 311,740, and declined 105,656 over the year.

A search for a replacement is under way, it said.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said in a prepared statement.

Symantec shares fell by nearly nine percent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq to $19.09 after having closed at $20.91 during the regular session. The shares have fallen by more than 14 percent since this time last year.

Bennett is a former CEO of Intuit and a veteran GE executive. He joined Symantec in 2012 at a time when the company was seen as a fading brand on both the consumer and enterprise security fronts.

His relatively short tenure as CEO will be best remembered for a series of corporate reorganizations. Last June he instituted a significant layoff of about 1,700 employees after announcing his intent to streamline the company into 10 operating units.

His plan had been to trim between $220 million and $250 million of Symantec’s annual operating budget, he said at the time. SEC filings show that as of the nine months ended December 27, Symantec’s operating costs had declined by $133 million. At that run rate, Bennett’s reductions would have amounted to about $178 million, well short of the goal he laid out last year. Restructuring charges in the first nine months of the year amounted to $237 million.

Bennett followed up on the layoffs by naming five new executives to help initiate what he described as a shift in direction and who would lead an effort to “drive innovative thinking.”

Symantec also reiterated its guidance for the quarter ending this month, saying that it expects revenue to decline by as much as 7.6 percent year on year to between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. It said it expects earnings per share on a GAAP basis to increase to between 29 cents and 31 cents a share, up from 27 cents in the year-ago period.

Brown, the interim CEO, joined Symantec’s board after it acquired the storage company Veritas in 2005. He was previously CEO of Quantum, a $6 billion storage hard drive manufacturer that was acquired by Maxtor in 2001, which was in turn acquired by Seagate Technology in 2005.###3653||Why did this happen?

Russia retaliated for US sanctions today but it's unclear if that was in retaliation for the first round of sanctions or the second round. The individual sanctions are a joke but sanctions against a bank could have some real effects. The loser is Bank Rossiya, which is the fifth-largest in Russia and has assets of about $10 billion (but only 1% of customer deposits). If Russia decides to respond in equal measure, what's the fifth-largest bank in the US? Goldman Sachs. Of course, Goldman's assets are an order of magnitude larger and they actually do business in Russia but I'm sure a few US bank executives in Russia are feeling stressed.###3655||Empty###3656||Twitter must appoint a legal representative in Turkey and block a number of individual accounts if the ongoing ban on the social media site is to end, the country's industry minister Fikri Isik has said.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January, but housing starts slipped.

Overall market sentiment improved after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Russia isn't seeking a partition of Ukraine. The comments came as the president signed a bill to absorb the Crimea region into Russia, following a referendum on Sunday.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the world’s largest retailer, means to take advantage of that via a video game trade-in program. Since Walmart is among the store chains that sells video games and consoles, the decision almost certainly will add to the revenue from this business.

The company announced:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

The plan, therefore, allows Walmart to sell the refurbished games at a discount to new ones, which could bring in a new group of customers who need or want to pay less for their gaming.

The consumer’s effort to take part is easy:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com.

About 3,100 Walmart stores will participate.

Walmart is taking a last bite at an aging industry, which may not exist in its current form just years from now. The success of consoles made primarily by Sony Corp.’s (NYSE: SNE) PS4, Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox One and Nintendo have been undermined by the rise of the tablet and smartphone. And traditional video games have been replaced to some extent by ones that can be downloaded from app stores, primarily those controlled by Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Some company has to take advantage of the end of an era. It might as well be Walmart, which has the customers, stores and online base to do so.###3659||Stocks declined on Wednesday afternoon, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained that the federal funds rate would not remain near zero forever.

After holding near the breakeven level throughout Wednesday’s trading session, stocks began to decline after the 2:00 release of the FOMC Statement at the conclusion to the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy meeting. At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a “dovish” leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

Despite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.61 percent to 1,860.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) declined 0.64 percent to finish at 3,682. The Russell 2000 (IWM) dropped 0.78 percent to 1,195.

In other major markets, oil (USO) advanced 0.37 percent to close at $35.71.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 95 cents (0.89 percent) to $105.84/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $28.60 (2.10 percent) to $1,330.40 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector lost altitude during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.43 percent to 7,549 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks advanced as the yen weakened slightly to 101.60 per dollar during the last hour of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A weaker yen causes Japanese exports to be more competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.36 percent to 14,462 (EWJ).

In China stocks declined modestly following widespread news reports that one of the nation’s real estate developers, Zhejiang Xingrun Properties, approached bankruptcy after its first corporate bond default early in the month. The news served as a reminder of last week’s remark by Premier Li Keqiang, that more corporate bond defaults can be expected. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.17 percent to 2,021 after rebounding from 2,006 during the last two hours of trading (FXI). The Shanghai Composite’s chart remains haunted by a bearish, head-and-shoulders pattern. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 0.07 percent to 21,568 (EWH).

European stocks advanced modestly on Wednesday after Eurostat reported that production in construction for the Eurozone increased by 1.5 percent between December of 2013 and January of 2014. On a year-over-year basis, construction increased by 8.8 percent in the Eurozone and by 7.3 percent in the greater. 28-nation European Union. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.08 percent surge to 3,076 – which was not enough to reach its 50-day moving average of 3,087, although it briefly broke above that level to reach a high of 3,089. Its Relative Strength Index rose from 48.29 to 48.71 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,830 on Wednesday, after a 0.61 percent decline to 1,860. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell from 59.62 to 54.62. The MACD turned downward from the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could continue its decline during the immediate future.





On Wednesday, all sectors were solidly in negative territory. The utilities sector took the hardest hit, falling 1.58 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.66%

Technology: (XLK): -0.41%

Industrials (XLI): -1.03%

Materials: (XLB): -0.88%

Energy (XLE): -0.75%

Financials: (XLF): -0.05%

Utilities (XLU): -1.58%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.30%

Consumer Staples (XLP): -0.77%

Bottom line: After spending most of Wednesday’s trading session near the breakeven level, the major stock indices began to decline immediately after the 2:00 release of the latest FOMC Statement. The decline became more significant during Janet Yellen’s press conference, when she indicated that the federal funds rate would be increased from its 0 – 0.25 percent range approximately six months after the Fed’s bond-buying program ends in the fall.

The £800,000-a-year French boss of British luxury handbag maker Mulberry quit today after a troubled two years in charge.

Bruno Guillon’s departure follows a series of profit warnings, a collapse in the share price and the loss of the label’s star designer. Mulberry also cancelled its show at London Fashion Week last month and instead unveiled a new collection from 21-year-old supermodel Cara Delevingne.

Fashion experts said Mr Guillon had paid the price for the failure of his strategy of taking the 43-year-old brand upmarket and ramping up prices.

He joined in March 2012 from French brand Hermès but under his leadership Mulberry lost City support, with three profit warnings in two years and a 60 per cent slump in the share price.

His decision to charge more alienated some customers. Mulberry’s flagship Alexa satchel, named after Alexa Chung, costs up to £4,500. The brand was also hit by the departure of creative director Emma Hill last June after a reported series of disagreements with her boss. She had been credited with transforming the Somerset-based business into a fashion powerhouse.

Mulberry will now be led by former chief executive Godfrey Davis, who will become executive chairman while a permanent replacement for Mr Guillon is sought. Today Mr Davis said the Frenchman had “enabled the company to increase its international appeal”.

But Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “My conviction is that Mulberry would be much better off making the most of the accessible and mid-price point handbags market.”###3662||March 21, 2014

NEW YORK—Security software maker Symantec says it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named director Michael Brown as his temporary replacement.

Bennett has been president and CEO of the company since July 2012. Symantec said that he resigned from the board of directors after his termination. He was also chairman of the company until Symantec split the chairman and CEO roles in January 2013.

The Mountain View, Calif., company did not cite a precise reason for Bennett’s ouster.

Gox, once one of the biggest exchanges for the digital currency.

Version 0.9.0 of the "Bitcoin Core" software , the Bitcoin infrastructure software previously known as Bitcoin-QT, contains five separate changes designed to make so-called transaction malleability attacks harder to pull off. As Ars explained last month , the attacks work by flooding exchanges with large numbers of malformed transactions that are similar, but not identical, to legitimate transactions that have already been made. Exchanges that trust one or more of the phantom records instead of the entries in the official Bitcoin blockchain can fall out of sync with the rest of the network and must recalculate their fund balances once the mistakes become apparent.

Attacks that abused the weakness caused several exchanges to suspend cash withdrawals. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox never recovered. Three weeks ago, it filed for bankruptcy after claiming to lose $468 million, $412.5 million of which it said belonged to customers.

In version 0.9.0, the transaction malleability weakness has been fixed by tightening transaction rules preventing “mutated transactions” from being relayed or mined. It also contains new functions that report wallet transactions that conflict with each other or that contain incorrect balances for double-spent (or mutated) transactions. It also includes an installation executable that works on 64-bit versions of Windows.

"If you are running an older version, shut it down," Wednesday's release notes stated. "Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version."###3664||Oh no! Page not found

Tens of thousands of Twitter users posted photos, cartoons, memes and artworks to express outrage at the decision of Turkey's courts to shut down the popular microblogging site.

Despite the ban, over half a million tweets were posted in just 10 hours by Turkish Twitter users, according to a report from Twitturk.

A defiant Erdogan had vowed to "wipe out" Twitter and said he did not care about the international community's reaction.

"We now have a court order. We'll eradicate Twitter. I don't care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic," Erdoğan said at his campaign rally in the western city of Bursa on 20 March, ahead of key administrative elections.

"Twitter, mwitter!," Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!".

Earlier this month, Erdogan warned that his government could ban YouTube and Facebook. Last year during the Gezi Park anti-government protest, he called social media "the worst menace to society".

Turkey's main opposition party, the CHP (Republican People's Party) said it will file a legal challenge against the court decision to block access to Twitter. Deputy prime minister Ali Babacan said that the Twitter ban was done "out of necessity" and was a "choice between two evils". He added that he expected the block to be temporary.

More than 45% of Turkey's 80 million people use the Internet, and around 14% of them use Twitter.

The disruption sparked an online uproar, with many netizens comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.

Turkey's block is a simple DNS redirect, implemented by Turkey's local ISPs.

Turkish netizens have already found ways to circumvent the ban.

It is possible to use the social network without accessing the website. Here's a list of suggestions as provided by Syrian-Bulgarian blogger Ruslan Trad on his website:###3666||Satellite data

In response to Crimea's joining the Russian Federation, the U.S. authorities imposed sanctions on 20 Russians, as well as against bank "Russia". The new list included the main owner of this bank Yuri Kovalchuk, Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, owning SMP Bank.

Afterwards, Visa and MasterCard international payment systems stopped conducting payment transactions for customers of these two banks without any notice.

Follow Trend on Telegram. Only most interesting and important news###3668||Empty###3669||Florida did a much better job of creating jobs last year than previously reported, but couldn't keep that momentum going into 2014.

The state added nearly 200,000 jobs last year, or about 35,600 more than it had estimated, according to revised figures released Monday. That's a 2.6 percent increase year-over-year, the fastest pace since the end of the recession in 2009.

January was another story.

Florida lost 2,600 jobs that month, led by a shrunken workforce in retail, hotels, restaurants, health care and government. Other than professional and business services, most industries were either flat or down.

The reversal came even as the state's unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping from 6.3 percent in December to 6.1 percent in January. The unemployment rate and the number of jobs created don't always move in lockstep, in part because they're drawn from two different surveys.

Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, said January's slippage shows just how far Florida has to go to reach full recovery.

"It's not a pretty picture," Brown said. "You do have to take the numbers with a grain of salt, but in general they're a little disappointing for the start of the year."

Economist Sean Snaith of the University of Central Florida agreed January was a setback but maintained that the upward jobs revision for 2013 was more important.

"We added an average of 3,000 more jobs a month in 2013 than we thought we had," he said. "By and large, I'd say it's a favorable report. It may be a harbinger of even better times ahead for Florida's labor market."

January was a rough month for Tampa Bay in particular. The area lost 14,100 jobs and its unemployment rate rocketed back up to 6.5 percent from an adjusted 6 percent in December. The region, which had been a statewide leader in job creation, has slipped to third biggest job-creator year-over-year behind Orlando and Miami. Compared to a year ago, the bay area is still up 29,400 jobs.

Unlike state data, metro area figures are less reliable as a gauge of economic health because they are not adjusted for seasonal hiring in industries like tourism and agriculture. As a result they tend to fluctuate more month to month.

Like Florida, the national jobless rate fell in January from 6.7 percent to 6.6 percent — and then ticked back up to 6.7 percent in February. (Florida releases its February data March 28.)

However, economists have repeatedly said the huge monthly drops in unemployment both nationally and statewide are likely overstated because of a simultaneous decline in labor force participation. People who are discouraged and at least temporarily give up their job search are no longer part of the labor pool and, therefore, not counted in the unemployment rate.

One sign of concern: Florida's 16-and-up population grew by 170,000 since January 2013, but its labor force only grew by 29,000 over the same period. Retirees account for a significant part of the labor pool slack, but not all of it.

Ironically, if job growth picks up as some economists expect, it may drive more discouraged workers back into the labor pool to compete for jobs. That could make the unemployment rate rise again, but it would still be a favorable sign of "a deepening labor market recovery," Snaith said.

Gov. Rick Scott, who was in Orlando on Monday morning, announced the new jobless rate through a brief YouTube video. In the clip, he touted that unemployment had fallen to its lowest level since June 2008. But Scott made no mention of last month's retraction in jobs.

In a separate news release, Scott's office focused on long-term positives:

• Since December 2010, Florida has created 503,500 private sector jobs.

• Over the same three-year stretch, unemployment has fallen 5 percentage points.

• The annual "benchmarking" revision to adjust the data and tie it to tax records showed the state added 40,700 more private sector jobs over three years on top of the original estimate of 462,100 jobs.

"We have come a long way in three years, but let's keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one," Scott said in a statement.

Mekael Teshome, an economist with PNC Financial Services Group, said he doesn't think the weaker-than-expected January report will sidetrack Florida. He still predicts the state will see balanced growth in 2014 and continue to outperform the rest of the country.

The lower labor force participation is a risk, Teshome said, "but I don't see the economy itself being at risk. The major aspects of the economy are improving … 2014, I think, should be better than 2013."

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

- Associated Press###3671||TALLAHASSEE - Florida's unemployment rate dropped slightly in January, although the actual number of jobs actually shrank, according to new data released Monday.

The mixed results did not stop Gov. Rick Scott from touting the latest numbers as he focused on the steady recovery of the state's economy.

"It is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," Scott said in a statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow."

Scott has made the rebound in the state's economy a centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. He has noted in campaign speeches that the unemployment rate increased under former Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist, who is now a Democrat and challenging Scott, has said Florida suffered because of the economic downturn that affected most of the nation and world.

The state's unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, which was lower than it was at the end of the year. The rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.

Despite the overall rate dropping slightly by 0.2 percent, the overall number of jobs in the state dropped by 2,600. The number of jobs is calculated using a separate survey.

Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, noted the decline to jobs to blast Scott for "desperately attempting to take credit for a recovery that's more anemic than what the economy was already predicted to do on its own."

Florida overall has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida trailed Texas and California.

Scott has said the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies, including his push to cut back on regulation and lower taxes.

But economists who work for the Florida Legislature have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or delayed their job search.

Monroe County in the southern end of the state had the state's lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, followed by Walton County in the Panhandle at 4.2 percent. Hendry County, in the southern interior, had the highest unemployment rate at 9.8 percent, followed by Flagler County at 9.3 percent.###3672||###3673||× No Debris Discovered in Latest Search for Missing Plane

(CNN) — The location where a Chinese satellite captured images of a large floating object was within Saturday’s search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but searchers did not find anything, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.

Officials will now consider the new Chinese images as it plans its search for Sunday.

Early Saturday morning, China released satellite images showing a large object floating in the southern Indian Ocean and sent ships to verify, the Malaysian transport minister said Saturday.

The object was said to be 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet).

China later said the satellite images showing the “suspected floating object” were captured four days ago, on March 18.

The floating object was said to be about 77 miles from where earlier satellite images spotted floating debris.###3674||Doh! 404!

Vermont’s unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average — the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state’s unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers — the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

“The January numbers start the year on a positive note,” Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. “Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth.”

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February’s report is due out in late March.

One of Vermont’s economic challenges is the size of the work force. With the exception of January’s preliminary numbers, the labor force has dipped in recent years after decades of solid growth.

Moody’s Investors Service named the downward trend in job growth as one of Vermont’s primary credit challenges in its October 2013 assessment of the state’s credit rating. The state’s rapidly aging population — a major factor in the overall labor trends — also topped the list of negative credit factors.

The ratings agency’s sister company, Moody’s Analytics, credits the tourism and food processing industries with helping to keep the state’s economy afloat in the short-term.

Seasonally adjusted state data show a 6.8 percent increase in leisure and hospitality jobs since January 2013: the arts, entertainment and recreation sector gained about 600 jobs. Accommodations and food services filled about 800 positions. Food manufacturing is also up.

Durable goods manufacturing led the seasonally adjusted declines in 2013, shedding 6.5 percent, or 1,400 jobs. Construction is also down, by about 2.1 percent, or 300 jobs, since last January.###3678||Florida did a much better job of creating jobs last year than previously reported, but couldn't keep that momentum going into 2014.

(NYSE: TM) have reached a settlement in the criminal investigation of the sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles. The company recalled more than 8 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010 after reports of sudden, unintended acceleration that may have been responsible for 75 fatal accidents that killed 93 people.

According to CNN, Toyota will pay more than $1 billion to settle the criminal investigation in a deal that could be announced as soon as Wednesday. The company has already paid out billions of dollars to settle civil claims related to the accidents.

The Justice Department investigation was initiated to determine what Toyota knew and when it knew it. The company’s public statements and disclosures to regulators were found to be misleading at least, and the unprecedented size of the settlement should be a warning shot across the bow of General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM).

GM’s recent recalls of 1.6 million vehicles to repair a problem with the vehicles’ ignition switch has all the hallmarks of a series of questionable public statements and even more questionable company decisions going to 2003. So far 13 deaths and numerous injuries have been attributed to the ignition switch defect.

Toyota stock closed down 0.76% on Tuesday, at $109.83 in a 52-week range of $99.70 to $134.94.

GM stock closed up 1.56% to $35.17 and added another 0.23% in after-hours trading.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used-video-game market. It's a business dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores.

In an apparent swipe at GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point of saying the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 9 cents to $74.77.

But analysts said the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used-game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.###3683||Empty###3684||"It is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation.

###3686||Empty###3687||Following a long-term pilot program started in 2009 but not expanded until today's announcement, Walmart has decided there is enough demand for a video game trade-in program in its stores. However, unlike the typical video game trade-in program, Walmart is hoping to leverage its general product selection as a key advantage against GameStop, despite the world's largest retailer never referencing the specialty chain by name.

Beginning on March 26th, Walmart will expand its game trade-in program to 3100 locations across the country, while used game sales are expected to begin later this Summer both in-store and online.

The expansion will also bring a new "certified pre-owned" section to the stores and online for game trade-ins. Ironically, the program goes live today for all Walmart employees before the official public launch, while Walmart will be able to pad out their used game inventory ahead of time.

The program relies on games from all current platforms and Walmart is boasting to the media that its average credit payout per game will be at least $35, significantly more than GameStop offers for games. Of course, the kicker is that while GameStop's program is limited to buying game-related products in its stores and online portal, Walmart wants the program to drive store and online sales with gift cards loaded with store credit in exchange for games. Oddly, the program currently excludes trade-ins of consoles.

On one hand, GameStop has to sit up and pay attention to this because it could get enough traction to cut into its trade-in volume, if marketed in the right way. On the other hand, limiting the trade-in program to games with original packaging means that GameStop still has some sort of advantage for older games.

One thing I'm curious to see is how people will game the trade-in program. Would you trade in your games at Walmart over GameStop or Amazon, or do you use other methods to get rid of games you don't play anymore? Below, the first TV ad announcing the program.

Regulatory changes are aiming to make reverse mortgages safer, writes the Wall Street Journal in a report this week, cautioning that the loans are still not for everyone.

The changes are working to ensure borrowers can uphold their loan obligations and make it “harder for borrowers to dig themselves into a hole,” the WSJ writes.

“Used wisely, reverse mortgages enable older adults to tap the value of their homes without having to uproot themselves and sell,” the report states. “But experts warn retirees to tread carefully with these complicated loans. Used improperly, a reverse mortgage can leave a retiree broke and without a roof over his head.”

The WSJ spoke with elder law expert Bernard Krooks of Littman Krooks LLP who noted that reverse mortgages are more complicated than other types of loans, particularly forward mortgages.

AARP policy advisor Lori Trawinski also weight in noting that like any loan, a reverse mortgage comes with obligations that must be met.

“The important thing about these mortgages that people really need to remember is that they are loans, and as with any loans they come with a set of obligations,” Trawinski told the WSJ.

The decision to take a reverse mortgage should consider input from advisers, accountants and estate-planning attorneys, WSJ says, including an overall outlook on the borrower’s financial situation.

“While it can be a useful part of estate planning, it’s not for everyone,” Krooks said. “It shouldn’t be done without being looked at in terms of overall financial needs.”

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin’s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 per cent in midday trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 per cent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank’s. They can also get cash directly inside their banks’ branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them,” according to the Interfax news agency.

Describing Rossiya, which was rumoured to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after

S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.###3691||Pound declines to almost 5-week lows against dollar

Investing.com - The pound dropped to nearly five-week lows against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as markets were jittery following reports armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol, although mixed U.S. economic reports did little to support the greenback.

hit 1.6552 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's lowest since February 12; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.6567, retreating 0.42%.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6426, the low of February 12 and resistance at 1.6666, Monday's high.

The risk-related pound weakened after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman, said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

In the U.S., data showed that the annual rate of inflation slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%. Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

However, U.S. housing starts fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Sterling was lower against the euro, with rising 0.32% to 0.8395.

Also Tuesday, a report showed that German economic sentiment deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.###3692||Posted Tuesday, March 18, 2014 8:48 am

Vermont's unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average - the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state's unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers - the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

Walmart is looking to stomp on competitor GameStop by kicking off a game trade-in program on March 26. Later this year the retailing giant will start selling pre-owned games.

GameStop's long-running program of accepting trade-in games for cash or in-store credit will be replicated by the nation's largest retail chain. Walmart and Sam's Club will allow customers to trade in games for Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 and immediately apply that value to any new purchase both in store or online, the company said.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Those interested in trading in their games will bring them to the store's electronics' department with the original case. An associate will then scan the game's bar code and evaluate the overall condition of the game. The customer will then be offered a trade-in value that can be accepted or denied. If accepted, the amount immediately becomes available to the customer for use in a future purchase.

Walmart said trade-in prices will range up to $35 per game. The program only includes games, not the hardware.

This program, obviously, will lead to Walmart starting to sell certified pre-owned video games later this year. These will be sold both online and in store. The company promises that these used games will be refurbished and in "like new" condition.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," added Mac Naughton.

Walmart already accepts trade-ins for tablets and smartphones.

The importance of the gaming market was clearly made yesterday as the research firm GFK Chart Trak reported that Titanfall from Electronic Arts landed in the top spot on the UK gaming charts. In addition, GFK credited the game with a 96 percent increase in UK Xbox One sales. Of these purchases, 70 percent took place through the TitanFall/Xbox One bundle that was offered.

Sightings of a wooden cargo pallet, along with some belts or straps, which may be linked to the passenger jet, raised hopes.The "first visual sighting" came after fresh Chinese satellite images emerged showing a large floating object in the same region around 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth.Meanwhile, two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin IL-76 planes will head toward the search area early Monday and provide relevant information for Chinese naval search vessels, Commander Liu Dianjun said Sunday.The two planes will fly from RAAF Base Pearce to Perth and will leave for the sea area in the southern Indian Ocean, where objects possibly related to MH370 were spotted by satellites. Liu said the Chinese aircraft will make a roughly eight-hour round-trip flight during their mission, with the furthest point 2,700 kilometers away from Perth.Chinese icebreaker Xuelong is expected to arrive Tuesday at the area in the southern Indian Ocean. The long-serving Antarctic research vessel is still some 1046 kilometers away from the search area, and it will take the icebreaker another 40 hours to get there.The Malaysia Airlines work team in Beijing Sunday had a 7-hour closed-door meeting with families of Chinese passengers on board. One of the relatives said that the plane was unlikely to have descended on land and the fact it disappeared from radar might be caused by the radar limitation, China News Service reported.###3699||Houma-Thibodaux posted the state’s lowest jobless rate at 3.5 percent in January, down from 5.1 percent the month before, new data show.

Houma-Thibodaux posted the state’s lowest jobless rate at 3.5 percent in January, down from 5.1 percent the month before, new data show.

The metro area, comprised of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, has posted the lowest unemployment rate among Louisiana’s eight metro areas every month for the past two years, except in October 2012.

Louisiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in January was the lowest since September 2008 and lowest in the 17-state southern region, where the average rate was 6.2 percent, according to data released Monday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent; it was 6.7 percent last month.

Houma-Thibodaux had an estimated 99,500 people employed in nonfarm jobs in December, the new figures show. That’s down 500 jobs for the month but up 2,300 for the year.

Goods-producing employment decreased by 600 jobs over the month and added 1,000 jobs over the year. Service-providing jobs increased by 100 for the month and 1,300 for the year.

The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved over the year in every parish as well as in all other Louisiana metro areas as follows:

Alexandria: 5.2 percent, down from 7.5 percent in January 2013;

Baton Rouge: 4.8 percent, down from 7.1 percent;

Over the past few years, around two million fakes have been removed from circulation every 12 months, at considerable cost to banks and the general economy.Plans for the coin were unveiled as Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne prepares to deliver his Budget today. This morning Osborne tweeted a picture of the coin against his famous red box:In addition to having 12 sides, the proposed replacement will have a bi-metallic construction of two colours and include the Mint's new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology.The Mint has spent around £2 million on iSIS and claims that it enables not just coins, but the whole cash cycle to be more secure, protecting the public, vending machine operators, retailers, and the wider banking system.The coin will have the Queen's effigy on the 'heads' side, but there will be a public competition to decide the design for the reverse, or 'tails' side.Says Osborne: "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."It's not just Britain's coins which are getting a makeover.

* On campaign trail, Erdogan vows to “wipe out” Twitter

* President criticises complete closure of platform

* Regulator says ban follows court order

* Twitter says stands with users in Turkey (Recasts, adds Twitter comment)

By Nick Tattersall and Orhan Coskun

ANKARA, March 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections brought a furious reaction at home and abroad on Friday, with users of the social networking service denouncing the move as a “digital coup” and the president expressing his disapproval.

A court blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.

“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon,” the company said in a tweet.

A company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.

Tech-savvy Turks - President Abdullah Gul apparently among them - quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.

“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.

Turkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.

Twitter users called the move a “digital coup”, some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.

“Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations,” U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.

Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticise the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.

The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.

EUROPEAN VALUES?

Telecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.

“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and “cast doubt on Turkey’s stated commitment to European values and standards”. Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.

Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a “vital role to play in a modern democracy”.

Turkey’s financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.

Twitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. “We will wipe out all of these,” he said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is.”

Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure “does not derive from a prohibitive mentality” and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

"This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen," George said in a statement. "The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming."

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected. The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the IG's office said.

The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of Social Security numbers, and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.

“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” George said.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.###3710||Hours after Twitter was officially blocked in Turkey, the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey went nuts across the world.

Tens of thousands of Twitter users posted photos, cartoons, memes and artworks to express outrage at the decision of Turkey's courts to shut down the popular microblogging site.

Despite the ban, over half a million tweets were posted in just 10 hours by Turkish Twitter users, according to a report from Twitturk.

A defiant Erdogan had vowed to "wipe out" Twitter and said he did not care about the international community's reaction.

"We now have a court order. We'll eradicate Twitter. I don't care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic," Erdoğan said at his campaign rally in the western city of Bursa on 20 March, ahead of key administrative elections.

"Twitter, mwitter!," Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!".

Earlier this month, Erdogan warned that his government could ban YouTube and Facebook. Last year during the Gezi Park anti-government protest, he called social media "the worst menace to society".

Turkey's main opposition party, the CHP (Republican People's Party) said it will file a legal challenge against the court decision to block access to Twitter. Deputy prime minister Ali Babacan said that the Twitter ban was done "out of necessity" and was a "choice between two evils". He added that he expected the block to be temporary.

More than 45% of Turkey's 80 million people use the Internet, and around 14% of them use Twitter.

The disruption sparked an online uproar, with many netizens comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.

Turkey's block is a simple DNS redirect, implemented by Turkey's local ISPs.

Turkish netizens have already found ways to circumvent the ban.

It is possible to use the social network without accessing the website.

Shares of Symantec sunk 9.4% in pre-market trading Friday after the computer security firm surprised investors by firing its CEO.

On Thursday, Symantec announced it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett. Board member Michael Brown will fill his role on an interim basis while a special committee begins a search for a new CEO.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement representing Symantec's board of directors.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Symantec is sticking with its fourth-quarter forecast, which has the company raking in between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion in revenue.

Bennett's firing marks another tumble for Symantec shares since reaching a 52-week high of $26.96 on August 13. In pre-market trading, shares are below $20. The last time Symantec stock closed under $20 was January 2013.

The Chipotle restaurant chain 2013 annual report concludes that increasing weather volatility as well as weather pattern changes and global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of their ingredients. As the costs of basics like avocados rise, Chipotle may reluctantly choose to temporarily drop some items from their menu such as guacamole and one or more salsas. Chipotle reportedly uses 97,000 pounds of avocados per day, about 35.4 million pounds per year.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A congressional committee will meet in Fresno on Wednesday, taking up California’s drought crisis at the heart of the state’s agricultural region.

The House Natural Resources Committee will hear testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state water officials — all grappling with the drought. The hearing at Fresno’s City Hall is titled “California Water Crisis and its Impacts: The Need for Immediate and Long-Term Solutions.”

“It is my hope that we will hear more about common ground and solutions that will bring more water to this Valley instead of rehashing the tired, partisan battles over California water,” Rep. Jim Costa, a Democrat from Fresno who serves on the committee, said Tuesday in a statement.

California is in its third consecutive dry year. Gov. Jerry Brown in January declared a drought emergency, and in February President Barack Obama visited to see the crisis firsthand, delivering millions in relief aid.

Water officials said Tuesday that February delivered promising rain, but they predict having to dramatically cut back on the water that farmers receive from a pair of vast systems of canals, reservoirs and dams operated by state and federal authorities. Many Central Valley farmers say they will leave fields unplanted.

The Natural Resources Committee has 47 members. A fraction of members are expected to attend, including Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington, who chairs the committee, along with Costa and Rep. Tom McClintock.

In advance of the hearing Tuesday, several California Republicans in Congress sent a letter to Obama and Brown urging them to use their powers to help farmers and communities hit hardest by the drought. Strict regulations aimed at protecting endangered fish allowed 445,000 acre-feet of water from February rains to be lost into the ocean, the letter said.

California’s rainy season typically ends by April, said the letter signed by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who was among 13 to sign the letter.

“Given that communities in Central and Southern California are struggling to meet water needs and farmers are fallowing hundreds of thousands of acres of land that feed our state and country,” the letter said, “loss of this water is absolutely unacceptable.”

Think tank ZEW's monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The consensus forecast was for 53. The drop was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

"The Crimea crisis is weighing on expert's economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. "Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The US and European Union imposed personal sanctions yesterday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.



The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditionsrose to 51.3 points from 50 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52 but still emphasising the strength of the German economy.



The German economy, a growth engine in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8% this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.



Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January. Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.



The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts andinvestors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said.###3719||Empty###3720||2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Coins at Introductory Prices

The popular music streaming company announced changes to its Pandora One subscription plan, which allows users to listen to the content without having to deal with advertisements. The price for the subscription has been $3.99 but it will be going up to $4.99. To keep users from getting too upset, the company grandfathered existing active subscribers into the already-set price of $3.99. The incoming subscribers will have to cough up an extra dollar a month when it goes up to $4.99 in May.

In a blog post on the Pandora blog, the company elaborated upon the changes and justified the price increase.

"We've been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month," the Pandora blog post said. "Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015."

The company then touched base on the new policy that will allow existing active users to continue paying the same price, for now, while others will see a small price hike.

"In order to continue to provide an ad-free listening option, we are implementing some changes to the way we price Pandora One, including a modest price increase for new Pandora One subscriptions."

Economic sentiment in the largest euro area economy, Germany, deteriorated sharply, reaching a 7-month low in March, data by the ZEW Centre for Economic Research showed today.

The ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung), reported that its index of German economic sentiment slid by 9.1 basis points to reach 46.4 this month, the weakest level since August, from a reading of 55.7 in February. At the same time, analysts had expected a smaller drop by 2.7 basis points to 53.0 this month.

In addition, the euro area economic sentiment also registered a decline, coming in at 61.5 in March, down from 68.5 in the previous month and as analysts projected the index will decline to 67.3 this month.

Meanwhile, demand for the Swedish krona was pressured earlier in the day, after it became clear that the board committee of Scania AB, recommended its minority owners to decline a bid by the German Volkswagen AG to buy the rest of Sweden’s truck maker. The board committee of Scania regarded that Volkswagen’s 6.7 billion-euro offer for the rest of the company too low.

"I followed Ted Cruz from Iowa all the way to New Hampshire, and I never got to meet him, despite being the only person in the world who wants to," Triumph told Colbert. This time he had better luck. He ribbed Cruz harder than O'Rourke, but Cruz also made more of an effort to join in on the insult comedy, to mixed effect.###3729||Empty###3730||Empty###3731||(Recasts with concerns about curbs in other countries, background)

SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s abrupt ban on Twitter Inc stirred concerns on Friday that the country may pull the plug on other social media and Internet services as it grapples with internal turmoil.

Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has in the past threatened to block Facebook Inc and Google Inc’s YouTube as well, though both remained online.

YouTube rejected requests by the Turkish government in recent weeks to block certain videos, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, citing anonymous sources. Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter’s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.

YouTube did not return requests for comment.

Twitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country’s government.

The ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.

For Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.

Analysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company’s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.

While Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey’s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“It’s a democracy, that’s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,” said York. “That could set a dangerous precedent.”

“I do think there’s a risk democracies could do this,” she added. “I don’t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site. I think instead what we’ll see is more pressure being put on Twitter to block certain content.”

Wall Street remains more focused on Twitter’s overall growth prospects and its budding advertising business, with Twitter’s stock finishing Friday’s regular trading session up 1.6 percent at $50.92 despite the situation in Turkey.

“If it does have any ripple effects, then obviously we would be concerned, but at this point I think it’s isolated,” said Arvind Bhatia of Stern, Agee & Leach.

But he noted that Twitter does have more political risk than other social media companies such as Facebook Inc, where messages tend to be shared among private groups rather than posted to the general public. Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.

Twitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.

A court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

The order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.

Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.

A Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.

Twitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

The clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter’s free-speech principles.

Because of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumors) can spread exponentially through “retweets,” Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.

Twitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.

The Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009. Twitter downplayed the likelihood of opening an office in the world’s largest Internet market, but the visit highlighted the tension between Twitter’s values and its business objectives.

Shareholders and consumers are applauding and taking notice in more ways than one.

Kellogg's is a pure-play food company with a 100-year plus legacy of maintaining integrity in the way it operates its business, serves its customers, and creates value for investors. I've been following the company for the past two years and the more I've learned about it the more I like it.

For shareholders and ethical investors looking for a publicly traded company that puts its conscience in synch with its corporate objectives, Kellogg's is one of the best. In fact, once again it's been recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, an independent research center promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance. In fact, Kellogg has been recognized six times.

One example: When Kellogg was hit by a shareholder proposal filed by the Green Century Equity Fund, the company decided to commit to only purchase deforestation-free palm oil by Dec. 31, 2015. Kellogg's uses palm oil in its snack food products and came under scrutiny over its joint venture with Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil trader with a high-profile track record of controversial environmental practices.

Lucia von Reusner, Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management, confirmed via email that "By raising the bar, Kellogg's palm oil commitment should encourage other companies to step up and support the development of transparent and responsible palm oil supply chains."

An investor who aims to be socially responsible finds this kind of ethical corporate effort encouraging. Like me, you can follow Kellogg's and monitor its sustainable and environmentally sensitive practices.

The other side of my enthusiasm for Kellogg's is it's business model and products. Not only is it the world's leading cereal company, it's also the second largest producer of cookies, crackers and savory snacks and a leading North American frozen foods company.

With 2013 sales of $14.8 billion and more than 1,600 food products it's little wonder that besides General Mills (GIS), Kellogg's is one of the most popular food stocks among investors. Average daily volume is about 2 million shares and its current market cap, according to Yahoo! Finance is $22.38 billion.###3733||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

Tech news from around the globe!###3735||Honestly, the idea behind Airbnb makes me really uncomfortable. I barely like having people I know in my place when I'm there, forget about trusting strangers when I'm not around. I read stories like this and it freaks me out to think just what someone might do to my place, and to my stuff.

I seem to be in the minority here, though, because the service has become incredibly popular over the last few years. It took Airbnb four years to serve its first four million guests, and then another five million in just a few months.

And now it looks to be raising a gigantic new funding round, at an astounding valuation.

The the online home-rental company is in "advanced talks" to raise a new round worth between $400 million and $500 million, according to a report out from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Private-equity firm TPG is said to be leading the round.

If true, the new round would bring the company's value to more than $10 billion. It would also more than double Airbnb's previous fundings put together.

Airbnb has raised $326 million altogether at a $2.5 billion valuation, including a $117 million Series B round from Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global and General Catalyst and, most recently, a $200 million Series C round from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst Partners, Crunchfund, Ashton Kutcher, and Founders Fund in 2012.

This latest round would bring Airbnb’s total funding to between $726 million and $826 million, and place it among the world's most valuable startups.

How much money Airbnb makes has not been divulged, but private company analyst Privco has estimated Airbnb’s 2012 revenue to be $189 million. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter forecasted at the beginning of last year that it won’t be long before Airbnb is pulling in $1 billion in revenue per year.

Since its founding in 2008, Airbnb has served more than 11 million total guests. In now operates in over 34,000 cities in 192 countries and has over 600,000 listings around the world.

Recently, the company has been looking to expand beyond ts current room rental service and into more hospitality services. In January it announced that it was piloting a cleaning service in certain zip codes of San Francisco and New York City, where hosts can arrange a cleaning of their listing prior to a guest’s check-in.

The cleanings are arranged by Handybook and Homejoy, and the cost of the cleaning service is taken from the renter's payout for the reservation.

The popular micro-blogging site, one of several that has been used to publish allegations of corruption in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inner circle, went dark in Turkey on Thursday, just hours after the embattled leader threatened to "wipe out" the social network.



The move sparked outrage from the opposition and the European Union -- which Ankara has long sought to join – as well as Erdogan's own administration.



Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a frequent user of social media, led the chorus of calls against the move. "A complete ban on social media platforms cannot be approved," he said, adding that it is not "technically possible to totally block access to platforms used all over the world".



Opposition lawmaker Aykan Erdemir said his party would take "legal action" against the ban, warning that the move would put Turkey into a league of undemocratic countries like China.



"This is an unbelievable violation of fundamental rights and freedoms," Erdemir, of the Republican People's Party (CHP), said.



European leaders said the move violated citizen's rights to freedom of speech and could threaten Turkey's bid to enter the 28-nation bloc. Ankara is already the world's top jailer of journalists, according to press freedom lobby group The Committee to Protect Journalists.



"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards," EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said in a statement.



"Social media has a vital role to play in a modern democracy. As a candidate country, EU expects Turkey to promote the values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law," tweeted Britain's embassy in Turkey.###3738||NEW YORK (AP) – Sally Beauty is reporting that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

Top Trending:###3739||Investing.com - Gold prices fell on Tuesday after Russia assured the world it wasn't out to annex Ukraine, while mixed data in the U.S. failed to convince investors the Federal Reserve was more likely to delay the pace at which it dismantles stimulus programs.

Gold has served as a safe haven of choice during the Ukraine crisis.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,356.20 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 1.22%, up from a session low of $1,351.20 and off a high of $1,368.40.

The April contract settled down 0.44% at $1,372.90 on Monday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,328.20 a troy ounce, the low from March 10, and resistance at $1,393.80, the high from Sept. 8.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine," suggesting that Russia's moves in the area would be limited.

The speech came one day after President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters opting to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy.

Elsewhere, mixed U.S. housing data failed to boost gold prices.

The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.

The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase.

U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

After digesting the data, investors viewed the numbers as strong enough to keep the Fed cutting its monthly bond purchases, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery, making gold an attractive hedge.

Currently, the Fed is purchasing $65 billion Treasury bonds and mortgage debt a month, though many expect the U.S. central bank to trim that figure to $55 billion at a policy meeting on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 2.09% at US$20.830 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were up 0.03% at US$2.953 a pound.###3740||You are using an older browser version. Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.###3741||Empty###3742||iNVEZZ.com, Thursday 20 March:

Silver today tumbled to a 5-week low of $20.225 as the market fine-tuned its expectation for the start of US interest rate-tightening, following yesterday’s monetary policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee.

The Federal Reserve’s rate-setting arm yesterday announced another $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of its quantitative easing programme, tapering it to $55 billion per month. Janet Yellen, in her first FOMC meeting as Fed chair, surprised the market by indicating that the first US rate hike since the financial crisis could happen “around six months” after the end of the QE program, which she sees concluding this autumn.

If the Committee continues with its gradual $10 billion taper-steps per meeting, the asset purchases would be halted this October, which would imply that Yellen expects rate-tightening to start in April 2015. “The market isn’t pricing the first hike until August next year”, emphasizes Danske Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren.

Following the policy decision, US Treasury yields and the greenback have been on the rise, while bullion prices have been hammered from the hawkish surprise by the US central bank. It is worth noting that after the Fed had announced taper-step number two on 29 January, silver found a bottom the very next day.

However, analysts at Credit Agricole underline that the latest shift in rate-tightening expectations may turn out to be “the catalyst of a sustained rise in US Treasury yields and broad USD strength” that a lot of market participants have been expecting.

Yellen’s remarks were also backed by the Committee’s median rate path forecasts for end-2015 and end-2016, which were revised higher from 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent and from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent respectively. The FOMC also ditched the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold embedded in its forward guidance.

Right now, silver is trading at 20.321, down 1.5 percent intraday.###3743||The French satellite image is the third set of images related to possible debris from the Malaysian flight 370, and giving searchers and officials more hope of answering questions relating to the world’s great aviation mystery.

France issued new satellite images on Sunday which show possible debris from the missing Boeing 777, Malaysian officials said, as searchers are presently combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, trying to locate the debris.

The images given to searchers in Australia “show potential objects” in the same part of the ocean where previous satellite images released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement.

Malaysia Airlines MH370 search: French satellite images provide more hope http://t.co/oIUAU5Baqe pic.twitter.com/XLOyGca0GD — CBC News (@CBCNews) March 23, 2014

The latest image seems to be another possible clue in the mysterious and futile search for the aircraft that went missing March 8, less than an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

In response to the newly released images from France, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said, “any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans.”

One of the objects in the French images was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite. But officials said the French satellite image was unclear and fuzzy, making it difficult to determine precise dimensions.

Ships have been sent in to try to locate a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colors. It was spotted Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.

“So, we’ve gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it,” said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s rescue coordination center. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

“The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the aircraft industry. They are usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft but within that container it is quite common to have items on pallets.” Barton said.

“It’s a possible lead but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well,” Barton said.

The images are reinforcing proof for the massive hunt for these objects, which has been underway since Friday. However, authorities are finding the remoteness of the search area, as well as weather, one of the biggest challenges.

“At 2500 kilometres (1,500 miles) away, they are operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area and back again so that’s only allowing us to get in a [single] search a day, which is again spreading the search over several days,” Barton said.

Eight aircraft searched 59,000sq.km of sea after China on Saturday revealed a satellite photo depicting a floating object 22.5mt (74 feet) long. Radar images from French authorities show potential objects in the vicinity, Malaysia’s transport ministry said on Sunday.

The developments rekindled prospects for breakthrough in the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 after radar and visual scans failed to find objects spotted in earlier images taken from space. Searchers, bolstered by a growing fleet of international vessels, also want to locate a wooden pallet seen from the air to check if it could have come from the jet’s hold.

“The aircraft are operating at extreme ranges,” said Australian Maritime Safety Authority official Mike Barton, “with the closest airfield 2,500km away”. “They’re operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of 1-2 hours in the search area.”

The Chinese photo, taken 18 March, is focused 90 degrees east and almost 45 degrees south, versus almost 91 degrees east and 44 degrees south for similar items on a 16 March satellite image, putting the object 120km southwest of that sighting, according to China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

Coloured straps

The dimensions appear similar to those of the larger of two objects seen previously, said to be 24mt long. The Malaysian plane, a The Boeing Co. 777-200, measures 63mt, with a wingspan of 61mt and a 6.2mt cabin diameter.

“French satellite images were received this morning and have been sent to the Australian centre leading the search in the southern Indian Ocean,” a Malaysian government statement said.

The French foreign affairs ministry said radar echoes had detected floating debris 2,300km from Perth and that extra satellites would be mobilized to pursue the search. No date or coordinates for the discovery were immediately provided.

“Separately, the wooden pallet spotted on Saturday from a civil search aircraft was among a number of small objects spread over 5km and could be of the kind used in planes,” the AMSA’s Barton told reporters on Sunday, adding that there appeared to be evidence of multi-coloured strapping belts around it. “The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry,” Barton said. “They’re usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft.”

Ships converge

A New Zealand P3 Orion surveillance plane dispatched to the scene on Saturday found only clumps of seaweed. “The more aircraft we have, the more ships we have, the more confident we are of recovering whatever material is down there,” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Sunday in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, according to a transcript. “Obviously before we can be too specific about what it might be, we do actually need to recover some of this material.”

As more potential debris is spotted, a growing fleet of vessels is converging on the area, while the number of planes deployed was increased to eight from six on Sunday, including four long-range civil aircraft and a US Navy P8 Poseidon.

HMAS Success from the Royal Australian Navy has joined the search, while the Ocean Shield, equipped with a sub-sea remotely operated vehicle, is on its way to the zone, as is HMS Echo, a specialist ship from Britain’s Royal Navy that’s fitted with underwater listening gear and devices to survey the seabed.

Sea fog

“The US was asked by Malaysia to provide similar search technology,” the US defence department said in a statement. Australia said two merchant vessels assisted in the hunt on Saturday, while China deployed at least seven ships, according to the Xinhua News Agency, a flotilla that reflects the urgency it attaches to finding Flight MH370, whose complement of 239 passengers and crew included more than 150 Chinese nationals.

“Sea fog hampered the search early on Sunday before conditions improved, though there were no sightings of significance before nightfall,” the AMAS said.

“Two Chinese Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft will join the hunt from Perth tomorrow and two Japanese P3 Orions left for the West Australian city today,” the Malaysian govt said.

“Two Indian military planes are also headed to the northern part of the zone. A US Orion plane is operating out of Malaysia and is scanning south of Indonesia in the vicinity of the Cocos Islands,” Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an e-mail. “The plane had previously been searching for debris in the Bay of Bengal.”

FBI role

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also joined the probe as Malaysian authorities seek data from a home computer flight simulator belonging to the jet’s captain.

The FBI has received digital media from Malaysian authorities, including information from the simulator’s hard drive, and technicians are examining the data in Virginia, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the case who asked not to be named because the probe is ongoing.

“Investigators are trying to learn more about what the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, did on the simulator, and part of that effort involves trying to examine files that may have been deleted from the drive,” the official said.

FBI agent Michael Kortan, a spokesman for the bureau, declined to comment. “The simulator hasn’t produced any clear lead yet for investigators,” Malaysia’s acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Saturday.

“Neither have authorities found any link between the aircraft’s cargo, which included lithium batteries, and its disappearance,” Hishammuddin said. “My biggest concern is that if we are not able to identify the debris, having to go back to the two corridors is a huge and massive area,” he said. “This is unprecedented.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said that the jet emitted pulse-like signals to a satellite about seven hours after last making voice contact, shifting the focus of the search to two arcs, one extending north to Kazakhstan and the other into the southern Indian Ocean. “In the northern zone, there have been no indications of the missing airplane on radar in China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,” Hishammuddin said.

Tropical cyclone

“Already facing strong currents and rough seas, the Indian Ocean search could be disrupted by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gillian,” Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, head of Malaysia’s civil aviation authority, told reporters near Kuala Lumpur airport. The storm is about 2,500km northwest of Perth, having passed over Christmas Island, and tracking slowly south.

Steady flight

An analysis of satellite pings shows that the Malaysian Airline System BHD 777 may have flown steadily across the ocean after diverting from its scheduled route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. That assessment gave the clearest idea yet on how investigators pinpointed a search zone.

Engineers at Inmarsat PLC, whose satellite picked up the pings, plotted seven positions for the jet on 8 March, Chris McLaughlin, a company spokesman, said in an interview. “The plane flew steadily away from the satellite over the equator while pinging,” McLaughlin said. The data helped investigators conclude that the most logical path was progressively either north or south, with the bulk of search efforts focused on the south.

“I hope that we’ll find the time soon when we’re able to conclusively say once and for all that we are close to finding where this plane may now be located, and that there can be some kind of closure for families,” Australia’s deputy prime minister Warren Truss told reporters on Sunday. “We will continue as long as there’s hope.” Bloomberg###3750||Empty###3751||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh session lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, following reports that armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol.

hit session lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.24% to 1.3888.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3850 and resistance at 1.3941, the session high.

The euro extended losses after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The euro slipped against the dollar earlier Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

The euro fell to session lows against the yen, with down 0.56% to 140.85.

Elsewhere, the dollar was trading close to session lows against the yen, with down 0.32% to 101.42, holding above last Friday’s trough of 101.19.###3755||Empty###3756||Brevard Unemployment Rises Despite Statewide Drop

Putin spoke after President Barack Obama ordered a second round of sanctions targeting about two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major bank supporting them. Moscow made its first retaliatory shot by banning nine U.S. officials and lawmakers from entering Russia.

Putin said in televised remarks at Friday’s session of the presidential Security Council that he sees no immediate need for further Russian retaliation and said sardonically that he would open an account in the Russian bank targeted by the latest U.S. sanctions.

Meanwhile, Russian stocks tumbled Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

The MICEX benchmark was down nearly 3 percent two hours into Friday trading with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were taking a pounding, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops or online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

Russia’s central bank sought to assure that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. authorities “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.” However, it added that the government could “take necessary steps to support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.

Share###3759||WASHINGTON (AP) - More than five years after the financial crisis struck, the biggest U.S. banks are better able to withstand a severe recession than at any time since the meltdown, the Federal Reserve has determined.

Results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks’ financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year’s tests.

“The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago,” said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The banks’ stronger positions should enable them to pursue business plans, pay dividends to shareholders, raise capital from investors and expand services to customers, said Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment - now at 6.7 percent - would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests - even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks’ progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.

The 30 banks were also tested on how well they would withstand severe downturns in Europe and in Asian countries like China and Japan.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Nearly all U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in assets were in the group of 30 that were tested. Together they account for some $13.5 trillion in assets - about 80 percent of U.S. banks’ total amount. Twelve of the 30 banks were added to the testing roster for the first time this year.

Most of the 30 banks tested, along with hundreds of others, received federal bailouts during the financial crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.

Zions, the only bank to fall short this year, is based in Salt Lake City. It slid to a loss in the fourth quarter as it booked hefty charges related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items.

Zions said in a statement that its performance on the stress tests was worse than it expected mostly due to significantly higher commercial real estate losses, significantly greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue. The bank said that it will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Ally said it was pleased that the test results “recognized the substantial transformation that the company has undergone since last year.”

The Fed concluded last March that Wall Street powerhouses JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needed better plans for coping with a severe downturn and gave the banks until September to revise them. The two banks were allowed to increase their dividends and buy back their stock on condition they submitted revised capital plans that satisfied the Fed.

At the same time, the Fed approved requests outright from 14 of the 18 banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

But the Fed forbade Ally and BB&T; Corp. from making any dividend increases and share buybacks they may have been seeking.

Next Wednesday, the Fed will announce whether it has approved each bank’s request, if one has been made, to raise dividends for shareholders. Its decisions will be based on how each bank would fare in a severe recession if it increased its payout.

Raising dividends costs money. The government doesn’t want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.

The other banks tested were: American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Comerica Inc., Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp, M&T; Bank Corp., Northern Trust Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., Santander Holdings USA Inc., State Street Corp., U.S. Bancorp and UnionBanCal Corp.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake - a total of more than 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

The coin will be announced as part of Chancellor Osborne's budget speech today.

This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser###3765||Empty###3766||Colorado legislative economists on Tuesday predicted that recreational marijuana taxes will bring in only half of what Gov. John Hickenlooper expects they will.

A forecast produced by economists at the nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects taxes on recreational marijuana will generate about $65 million in the fiscal year beginning in July. Hickenlooper’s projection, released last month, expects nearly twice that — $125 million.

The new prediction further adds to the debate over how lucrative first-in-the-nation taxes on recreational marijuana will be for the state’s coffers. In January, tax revenue came in on pace to be far below previous predictions for the last six months of the current fiscal year.

But Legislative Council economist Larson Silbaugh told members of the legislature’s Joint Budget Committee on Tuesday that too many variables — from the low number of stores open, to the high interest in history-making marijuana purchases — make the January numbers unreliable predictors of what’s to come.

“You can basically use that January number to justify any forecast you want,” he said.

Instead, Silbaugh said Legislative Council economists are more pessimistic than the governor’s economists about how many people will stay in the recreational marijuana market long-term. Recreational marijuana costs about 20 percent more than medical marijuana, he said. And that’s before the hefty taxes on recreational marijuana are applied.

Silbaugh said legislative economists believe many people will decide it is more cost-effective to remain medical-marijuana patients. While such patients must pay up front for a doctor’s evaluation and a state registration fee, medical-marijuana purchases are subject only to the state’s general 2.9 percent sales tax.

“We’re not expecting a lot of new marijuana users because of retail marijuana,” Silbaugh said. “And we’re not expecting because of the price differential, many medical marijuana users shifting over to the adult use market.”

For that reason, legislative economists predict Colorado marijuana stores will do more than $750 million in recreational and medical marijuana sales in the coming fiscal year. Hickenlooper’s economists have put that figure at nearly $1 billion.

However much recreational marijuana taxes generate, Hickenlooper has proposed using all of the money to deal with issues related to marijuana legalization — including funding drug treatment and youth drug-use preventions. Lawmakers are considering the proposal.

John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold###3767||Empty###3768||Detained Russian opposition activist Alexey Navalny yesterday called on the US government to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s cronies:

Such sanctions should primarily target Mr. Putin’s inner circle, the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation’s wealth, including Gennady N. Timchenko, head of the Volga Group; Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, influential businessmen and former judo sparring partners of Mr. Putin; Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a financier believed to be Mr. Putin’s banker; Vladimir I. Yakunin, president of Russian Railways; the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively.

Apparently the call to action was heard, and the US is attempting to ratchet up pressure on Putin’s real inner circle. Today, some but not all of these names—Timchenko, the Rotenbergs, Kovalchuk, and Yakunin—have been added to the list of people who cannot travel or transact business in the United States. A spokesman for Timchenko’s oil-trading firm, Gunvor, told Quartz “it is clear no due diligence was performed to support this accusation,” and said that Putin has never been a beneficiary of the firm or its activities.

Kovalchuk’s financial institution, Bank Rossiya, also made the list. Mark Dubowitz, one of the architects of the Obama administration’s Iran sanctions, recently told Quartz that crippling a single Russian financial institution by cutting it off from international transactions would be a key symbol—”the ‘kill the chicken to scare the monkeys’ theory of financial sanctions.” NPR’s former Moscow correspondent, Gregory Feifer, describes Bank Rossiya, the chicken in question, in his recent book:

The deeply obscure but hugely powerful Bank Rossiya … has been accused of using secret offshore companies to channel state loans intended for the acquisition of a jaw-dropping collection of Gazprom assets. Former bank insiders have said shady privatizations of companies such as Gazporm’s Sogaz insurance firm enabled Bank Rossiya to suck billions of dollars’ worth of value from the parent company. Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who is a keen observer of the hidden aspects of Russia’s economy, says the Putin circle’s “sheer asset-stripping” includes huge capital expenditures—$52 billion in 2011—on pipelines and other projects that cost far more than they would in other countries because much of the money is skimmed off.

The logic behind the sanctions is to squeeze the people who have benefitted from Putin’s reign. That is likely to be more effective than sanctioning Russian politicians who may not even have international financial interests. But by holding off on sanctioning Usmanov and the leaders of Russia’s two state-controlled oil firms, the US might be once again failing to send a strong enough message. Either that, or leaving itself room to escalate.###3769||Unemployment rates fell in 43 US states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department says the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent.

That's far below the national rate of 6.6 per cent that month.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell.

Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs that month, below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The settlement is estimated to about 1.2 billion dollars and is expected to be officially announced by the Justice Department later on Wednesday.

One of the analysts working for the auto researcher Kelley Blue Book – Mr. Karl Brauer said in a telephone interview that was cited by Bloomberg: “It’s a big number to pay and yet Toyota’s also a company that can most easily digest that kind of a number and move forward.”

The settlement, if actually reached, will put an end to a four-year investigation that is said to be finalized with one of the biggest fines the auto manufacturer ever got. The investigation put a stain on Toyota Motor Corp.’s name, which seriously affected its attempt to become the best selling car manufacturer in the world. The settlement would also help the company improve its positions on the market.

Julie Hamp, who is a spokeswoman of Toyota, said in a statement, which was cited by the Wall Street Journal: “Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years. During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Ms. Jerika Richardson, who is a spokeswoman of the Manhattan Attorney Preet Bharara refused to make any comments on the rumours whether such a settlement has been reached. The spokeswoman of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York – Kelly Langmesser also declined to comment the situation.

Toyota Motor Corp. settled on Wednesday at 5 508 yen, down 0.76%, marking a one-year change of +11.50%. The world’s largest auto manufacturer is valued at 19.14 trillion yen. According to the Financial Times, the 23 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Toyota Motor Corp. have a median target of 8 000 yen, with a high estimate of 9 600 yen and a low estimate of 6 200 yen. The median estimate represents a 44.14% increase from the previous close of 5 550 yen.###3775||Sharp rise in worldwide sales volume expected

EBIT margin target: 8 – 10% in Automotive segment

Group profit before tax also forecast to increase sharply

BMW Group can look ahead with confidence to the current financial year. Group profit before tax and sales volume are both expected to rise to new high levels.

“We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles”, stated Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG at the Annual Accounts Press Conference on Wednesday in Munich.

The planned growth in sales volume should also be reflected in group profit before tax (2013: € 7,913 million): “We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions”, continued Reithofer. The pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

Despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies, the Automotive segment will again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10% (2013: 9.4%). Tailwind will also come from the 16 new models and model revisions, which the BMW Group plans to launch in the current year.

Despite challenging conditions on international motorcycle markets, sales of the Motorcycles segment are forecast to be slightly up on the previous year (2013: 115,215 units), not least due to the contribution expected from the new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs (the R nineT, S 1000 R, R 1200 RT, R 1200 GS Adventure and K 1600 GTL Exclusive).

The Financial Services segment is expected to also remain on growth course in 2014. As a consequence of growth-related investments, the return on equity is likely to decrease slightly (2013: 20.2%), but still surpass the BMW Group’s minimum required level of 18%.

The forecasts for the current year are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

BMW Group posts record figures in 2013 for fourth successive year

The BMW Group continued to perform well during the past year within a challenging economic environment worldwide and successfully maintained its position as the world’s leading premium manufacturer. “We have recorded our highest ever sales volume and group profit figures for 2013 and achieved all the targets we set ourselves for the full year”, pointed out Reithofer.

Group revenues for 2013 totalled € 76,058 million (2012: € 76,848 million;

-1.0%) and were thus marginally down on the previous year, with the difference due to exchange rate developments. Group profit before tax (EBT) increased by 1.4% to a new high of € 7,913 million (2012: € 7,803 million) despite increased investment in new technologies, greater competition and higher personnel costs. Group net profit climbed by 4.5% to € 5,340 million (2012: € 5,111 million), also a new record figure for the BMW Group.

Capital expenditure increased year-on-year by 27.6% to € 6,687 million (2012: € 5,240 million), giving a capital expenditure ratio of 8.8%. The main focus in 2013 was on product investments for production start-ups (including the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer) and infrastructure-related investments to enable further growth.

Research and development expenditure rose by 21.3% to € 4,792 million (2012: € 3,952 million), as a result of which the research and development ratio climbed to 6.3% (2012: 5.1%). Important areas of investment were the renewal and expansion of the product range, alternative drive technologies, lightweight construction and connectivity for vehicles.

The BMW Group increased deliveries to customers by 6.4% to 1,963,798 units (2012: 1,845,186 units), with all three brands registering all-time highs.

Record dividend of €2.60 per share of common stock proposed

BMW AG is committed to sharing its success with its shareholders. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2014 that the dividend be increased to a new highest level of € 2.60 (2012: € 2.50) per share of common stock and € 2.62 (2012: € 2.52) per share of preferred stock. Based on these figures, the total distribution will rise to € 1,707 million (2012: € 1,640 million). The dividend rate is unchanged at 32.0% and is within the BMW Group’s target corridor of 30 to 40%.

Automotive segment: EBIT margin at 9.4% in 2013

Automotive segment revenues rose by 0.6% to € 70,629 million (2012: € 70,208). Influenced by the above-mentioned factors – high expenditure for new technologies, product range expansion and market launch costs as well as increased competition – EBIT decreased to € 6,657 million (2012: € 7,599 million; -12.4%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.4% and was thus in the upper half of the targeted corridor of between 8 and 10%. Segment profit before tax amounted to € 6,561 million (2012: € 7,170 million; -8.5%).

The BMW brand retained pole position in the premium segment in 2013, with worldwide sales up by 7.5% to 1,655,138 units (2012: 1,540,085 units). The BMW X1 as well as the BMW 3, 5, and 6 Series all asserted their positions as market leaders in their own segments.

Solid growth was recorded again for the BMW X1, with sales volume up by 9.2% to 161,353 units (2012: 147,776 units). The BMW X3 performed well again and recorded a 5.0% increase to 157,303 units (2012: 149,853 units). Sales of the BMW X5 were only slightly down on the previous year at 107,231 units (2012: 108,544 units; -1.2%) despite the model change (the new BMW X5 has been available since mid-November).

The BMW 3 Series remained a major source of growth in the past year, with sales rising by 23.0% to 500,332 units (2012: 406,752 units). The success story of the BMW 5 Series continued over the twelve-month period, during which 366,992 units were sold (2012: 359,016 units; +2.2%). The BMW 6 Series was also able to make significant progress, with sales up by 19.4% to 27,687 units (2012: 23,193 units).

MINI similarly set a new sales volume record in 2013, with worldwide sales edging up by 1.2% to 305,030 units (2012: 301,526 units). The new generation of the MINI will make its appearance in the showrooms from spring 2014 onwards. The MINI Hatch, at the end of its model life-cycle, still managed to achieve a sales volume of 128,498 units (2012: 131,569 units; -2.3%). Sales of the MINI Countryman were roughly at the previous year’s level, with a total of 101,897 units sold (2012: 102,271 units; -0.4%). In the period from its launch in mid-March to the end of 2013, the MINI Paceman achieved a sales volume of 14,687 units.

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars remained market leader in the ultra-luxury segment in 2013 and, with sales of 3,630 units (2012: 3,575 units; +1.5%), achieved a new sales volume record for the fourth year in succession.

The BMW Group recorded sales volume growth on nearly all continents in the past year. “The BMW Group’s sales strategy is geared towards achieving an evenly balanced distribution of worldwide sales across the three main regions of the world to avoid overdependence on any single market”, commented Reithofer.

At 859,546 units, sales in Europe – the BMW Group’s largest sales region – were almost at their previous year’s level despite challenging business conditions in some countries (-0.7%).

For the first time, the number of vehicles sold by the BMW Group in Asia exceeded the half-million mark. Sales in the region grew by 17.3% to 578,678 units, helped by a 19.7% rise on the Chinese mainland to 391,713 units.

The BMW Group continued to perform well in the Americas region, with deliveries to customers up by 9.0% to 463,822 units, including 376,636 units sold in the USA (+8.1%).

Motorcycles segment also sets new sales volume record

Sales volume, revenues and earnings of the Motorcycles segment rose in 2013. Revenues edged up by 0.9% to € 1,504 million (2012: € 1,490 million). EBIT rose to € 79 million (2012: € 9 million) and profit before tax to € 76 million (2012: € 6 million). Segment earnings in 2012 were impacted by expenses incurred in realigning the Motorcycles business. Despite challenging market conditions, a new sales volume record was set for 2013, with the number of BMW motorcycles delivered to customers reaching a new of level of 115,215 units (2012: 106,358 units; +8.3%).

Good progress made by Financial Services segment

The Financial Services segment continued to perform well during the past year. Revenuesincreased by 1.7% to € 19,874 million (2012: € 19,550 million). Profit before tax amounted to € 1,639 million (2012: € 1,561 million), 5.0% ahead of the previous year.

The number of new contracts within the credit financing and leasing lines of business grew worldwide by 9.7% to 1,471,385 contracts (2012: 1,341,296 contracts). The portfolio of lease and financing contracts in place with dealers and retail customers at 31 December 2013 climbed by 7.4% to a total of 4,130,002 contracts (2012: 3,846,364 contracts).

Workforce size increased – record number of apprentices

In 2013, the BMW Group trained more young people than ever before, employing a total of 4,445apprentices worldwide. Reithofer commented: “We consider training to be an investment in the future of the company and in society.

The size of the workforce increased by 4.2% in 2013, reflecting both dynamic growth in business volumes and the rapid pace of innovation. At the end of the reporting period, the BMW Group had a worldwide workforce of 110,351 employees (31 December 2012: 105,876 employees). The increase is due to the growing need for engineers and skilled workers in order to keep pace with continued strong demand on the one hand and to push ahead with innovations and develop new technologies on the other.

BMW Group in fourth quarter 2013

BMW Group revenues in the last quarter of 2013 totalled € 20,210 million and were thus marginally down on the previous year’s figure (2012: € 20,536 million; -1.6%). EBIT for the three-month period increased by 4.2% to € 1,951 million (2012: € 1,872 million), while profit before tax rose by 7.3% to € 1,889 million (2012: € 1,760 million). Profit after tax improved by 9.5% to € 1,306 million (2012: € 1,193 million). The total number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered to customers in the period from October to December grew by 3.5% to 527,620 units (2012: 509,684 units).

Automotive segment revenues in the fourth quarter were almost unchanged at € 19,325 million (2012: € 19,496 million; -0.9%). EBIT amounted to € 1,770 million (2012: € 2,054 million; -13.8%) and profit before tax to € 1,766 million (2012: € 1,899 million; -7.0%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.2%.

Fourth-quarter Motorcycles segment revenues totalled € 269 million (2012: € 274 million; -1.8%). The segment reports negative EBIT of € 14 million (2012: negative € 73 million) and a pre-tax lossof € 14 million (2014: loss of € 74 million).

Financial Services segment revenues increased by 0.5% in the final quarter of 2013 to € 4,992 million (2012: € 4,968 million). EBIT jumped by 25.5% to € 335 million (2012: € 267 million) andprofit before tax by 19.9% to € 325 million (2012: € 271 million).

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after “old format” wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox’s problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox’s statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn’t specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.###3777||Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration published in the Federal Register new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would have to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

“Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can’t finish, we won’t shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don’t have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can’t get coverage again until next year,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare’s six-month enrollment period. Most of those bugs have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website’s capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.

The existing £1 coin is to be replaced with one modelled on the 12-sided former threepenny bit.

The Chancellor will say in the Budget today that the existing coin has become vulnerable to counterfeiters and will be replaced in 2017.

Figures show that there are around 45 million fake £1 coins, about 3 per cent of those in circulation. Banks now detect and remove about two million counterfeit £1 coins each year.

The new version, which George Osborne will boast is the most secure in the world, will be made of two metals and use technology as secure as that which guarantees banknotes.

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain plans to replace its 1-pound coin with a new version modelled on the country’s historic threepenny piece, finance minister George Osborne will announce later on Wednesday.

The new pound’s proposed twelve-sided shape composed of two different coloured metals will help with efforts to crack down on fake currency, the finance ministry said.

“After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current 1-pound coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” Osborne said in a statement.

He will formally notify Britain’s lawmakers of the proposed new coin, to be introduced in 2017, as part of his annual budget announcement in parliament.

The current pound has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the finance ministry said, with about 3 percent of all 1-pound coins, or 45 million, believed to be forgeries. That figure rises to 6 percent in some parts of the country.

The new coin will be armed with new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology developed by the Royal Mint, the maker of Britain’s coins whose history dates back over 1,100 years.

“We think it’s suitably British,” the Royal Mint’s director of circulation Andrew Mills told BBC Radio. “It’s very reminiscent of two other British coins. The twelve-sided shape is very reminiscent of the threepenny bit and secondly, of course, it doesn’t look that dissimilar to the 2-pound coin.”

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle.

A public consultation will be held over the summer to consider the metal composition and to weigh up the impact of the new-shaped coin on different stakeholders such as vending machines operators.

Earlier today in response to Turkey Blocks Access to Twitter for National Security Reasons I commented ...



"No one will see the "power" of the Turkish Republic in idea suppression announcements. They will see the arrogance, cowardice, and desperation of prime minister Erdogan."



Twitter Use Breaks New Record



Tonight I am pleased to report Twitter Use Jumps to New High in Turkey

Turkish users of Twitter, including the country's president, have flouted a block on the social media platform by using text messaging services or disguising the location of their computers to continue posting messages on the site.



In what many Twitter users in Turkey called a "digital coup", Telecom regulators enforced four court orders to restrict access to Twitter on Thursday night, just hours after the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vowed to "eradicate" the microblogging platform in an election speech.



The disruption followed previous government threats to clamp down on the social media and caused widespread outrage inside and outside Turkey. In a first reaction to the ban, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the European commission, tweeted: "The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is."



Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: "The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards."



The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.



On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets – 17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting records for Twitter use in the country. "Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan," posted @Fakir_Bey. "And yours?"



Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Isik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.



Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.



Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter "a menace to society".



Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.



"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism," said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.

Arrogance, Cowardice, Desperation



So much for the extreme arrogance of Prime minister Erdogan who banned Twitter for "national security" reasons.



Erdogan told an election rally in the western city of Bursa "The international community can say this or that – I don’t care. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic."



Erdogan is a complete fool who is now officially "burnt toast". He is gone except by military force, and even that won't last.



Please tweet this post in the appropriate places, especially my comment (slightly modified) to fit tweet length ...

No one will see the "Power of the Republic" in Erdogan's announcement. They will see arrogance, cowardice, and desperation.



By the way, if you get the idea things are blowing up all over Europe, it's because they are.

http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com###3788||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Symantec's (SYMC) board has terminated Steve Bennett as president and CEO after less than two years at the software maker's helm, it announced after market close. The company has appointed Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

Shares of Symantec were off 6.72% to $19.50 in extended trading.

Bennett's departure comes just 20 months after he took the company's reins from Enrique Salem. The former Intuit (INTU) CEO vowed to breathe new life into Symantec, which had long been criticized for poor execution. Last January he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

In November, however, he acknowledged that he underestimated the impact of the massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his turnaround plan.

Symantec shares have fallen 14.83% over the last 12 months. In January, the company was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, which noted potential sales disruption from Symantec's transition.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman, in a statement released after market close. "These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," added Schulman.

Bennett also resigned from Symantec's board on Monday.

Brown joined Symantec's board in 2005 following the company's merger with Veritas. Previously, he was the CEO of Quantum corporation. "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan," said Brown, in the Symantec statement. "The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market."

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a "leading executive search firm," according to Symantec's statement.

Symantec also reiterated its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance after market close, forecasting revenue between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion in the same period last year. Excluding items, Symantec expects earnings between 40 and 42 cents a share, compared to 44 cents a share in the prior year's quarter.

The boss of Mulberry has quit after two years in charge of the luxury handbag firm.

Bruno Guillon's departure follows a profit warning from the company in January, in which it said results would be "substantially" below expectations.

Mulberry's shares fell by more than 25% as a result and have not recovered.

Mr Guillon will be replaced on an interim basis by former boss Godfrey Davis, who oversaw rapid growth of the brand between 2002 and 2012.

Mr Davis said his predecessor had "improved the quality of the Mulberry offering", and added: "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The company issued a profits warning within months of Mr Guillon's appointment in March 2012, and in June last year announced the departure of creative director Emma Hill, who had been credited with much of the company's previous success.

Mulberry's latest profit warning earlier this year came after it said retail sales fell over the key Christmas trading period, down 7% in the eight weeks to the end of January.

It said it had experienced "significant" cancellations of wholesale orders from South Korea, and that annual profits would be about £19m, compared with analyst forecasts of £27m.

Mulberry shares rose by 1.26% in early trading on Thursday.###3790||Toyota Motor Company and the US Justice Department had reached a settlement worth $1 billion (720 million euros) over the Japanese company's handling of consumer complaints about the safety of its cars, US television news channel CNN reported Wednesday.

In a similar report on Wednesday, the US business daily Wall Street Journal also said a settlement to this amount was discussed, but according to unnamed sources was still likely to fall apart.

A spokeswoman for Toyota told CNN that the Japanese carmaker had cooperated with the US Attorney's Office in this matter for four years.

"During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements," the spokeswoman said. Both CNN and Wall Street Journal said the US Justice Department was not available for comment.

In 2009, Toyota started a series of massive recalls involving more than 10 million cars, mostly in the United States. The problems involved faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats that had led to unintended acceleration of its cars.

The US Attorney's Office has been investigating allegations Toyota had misled US authorities after the complaints. Between 2010 and 2012, the company already paid $66 million in fines for delays in reporting its safety problems.

Just recently, the Justice Department has started a probe into whether US automaker General Motors was slow in recalling cars with a defect linked to 13 deaths.

uhe/mz (AP, Reuters)###3791||New York City’s ambitious bike share program, which was touted by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and backed by Citigroup, is in deep financial trouble, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The program, which opened to the general public last June, is struggling to generate interest from tourists and has suffered from computer glitches and logistical problems, all of which has created the need for tens of millions of dollars in extra funding just to keep it afloat.

The bike-share program faced “a number of financial and operational challenges,” said Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Citi Bike has nearly 100,000 annual members who pay $95 for a year’s worth of unlimited 45-minute rides. But the program has generated very little interest from tourists and other short-term users.

Operated by a group called NYC Bike Share, which is itself owned by Alta Bicycle Share, Citi Bike offers 24-hour and 7-day access plans. Those plans are relatively more expensive at $9.95 for the day plan and $25 for the week plan.

Besides having a hard time attracting those customers, Citi Bike faces the problem of manually changing out batteries at the 330 docking stations located throughout the city. A subcontractor was hired to do the expensive work, the Wall Street Journal reports and also notes that the program’s financial struggles have led to some layoffs.

The Citi Bike program was both widely touted and criticized during its development through 2012 and 2013.

Mayor Bloomberg championed the program as an environmentally-friendly way to help New Yorkers and its 50 million-plus annual tourists get around the city. Others have complained that the bike program is discriminatory. Alta, the program’s operator, places a 260 pound weight limit on bike riders, though officials have said that the limit will not be strictly enforced. Others have argued that the program is not easily-accessible to minority customers given the locations of the bike stations.

Bloomberg also highlighted that the program is entirely privately funded. But the Wall Street Journal notes that extra financial backing may be hard to come by given that the Citi Bike program is so closely identified with its namesake Citigroup. The bank provided $41 million in seed capital to get the program off the ground, and the 10,000 bikes all bear the company’s logo.

MasterCard is also a contributor to the program, providing payment services as well as $6.5 million in financing.

(CNN) – If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS; be suspicious.

Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they're calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever.

Officials say more than one-million dollars has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people.

The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.

Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who don't pay up.

According to the inspector general, real IRS officials typically reach out by mail first, rather than phone, and don't demand immediate payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The IRS asks anyone who has received one of the phony calls to report it.

They say they've gotten more than 20,000 reports.###3793||RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

The IRS inspector general says thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million. As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer.

Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license.

J. Russell George is the IRS inspector general. He said Thursday that real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail. He says real agents don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

He says people have been targeted in nearly every state.

###3798||The state’s seasonally adjusted jobless rate dropped 0.4 percent to 6.4 percent in January, from 6.8 percent in December, and is now at the lowest point since September 2008, when it stood at 6.3 percent, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) said today.

The Indiana’s unemployment rate remains below all neighboring states and is now lower than the national rate by 0.2 percent, DWD added. “Prior to the benchmarking process, the last time Indiana's rate was lower than the national rate was June of 2012.”

Even so, despite a gain of 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector, Indiana shed a total of 7,100 private sector jobs in January, “mainly due to the extreme nature of the winter season, which has been cited by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the chief causes of employment contraction throughout the country,” DWD said.

“There are many positives to note this month,” DWD Commissioner Scott Sanders said. “Indiana's unemployment rate is not only lower than our neighboring states, but the national rate as well. In addition, 2,700 Hoosiers returned to the labor force and fewer were unemployed in January than at any time since August of 2008, causing our rate to fall almost one-half of a percentage point in one month.”

Sanders also noted that Indiana's 2013 total private-sector job growth number was revised upward by 8,200 jobs to 50,800 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and that despite the extreme winter weather, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were nearly 6,000 below January 2013 levels.

Sectors showing gains in January included manufacturing (+4,600); financial activities (+1,400); and professional and business services (+200).

Sectors showing decline in January included trade, transportation and utilities (-4,900); construction (-4,300); private educational and health services (-2,100); and leisure and hospitality (-600).

Total non-farm employment decreased in January by 10,000 jobs.

A court blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to "wipe out" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.



Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.



"We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon," the company said in a tweet.



A company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.



Tech-savvy Turks — President Abdullah Gul apparently among them — quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.



"One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.



Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.



Turkey's main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country's bar association filed a separate court challenge.



Twitter users called the move a "digital coup", some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.



"Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations," U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.



Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.



Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticize the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter's increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.



The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.



Telecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.



"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens," it said.



European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and "cast doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards". Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.



Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a "vital role to play in a modern democracy."



Turkey's financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.



Twitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.



Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. "We will wipe out all of these," he said. "The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is."



Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure "does not derive from a prohibitive mentality" and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling

Unit sales jumped 6.4 percent to a record 1.964 million vehicles, with all three company brands - BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce - registering all-time highs, the Munich-based company said.

Noting that BMW had achieved a new sales record for the fourth consecutive year, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer told a news conference that the weakness of European markets had been compensated with higher growth in the United States and China, accounting for a share of 20 and 19 percent respectively in 2013.

Stressing BMW's principle that production must follow the market, Reithofer said that the company was currently evaluating the possibility of expanding capacity at its Spartanburg plant in the US. Moreover, production in China was planned to be revved up to 400,000 cars in the medium term, while a joint venture with Chinese carmaker Brilliance was beginning engine production in 2016. In Brazil, a new factory would go online this fall, tapping into the Latin American growth markets, Reithofer added.

Therefore, BMW was looking forward with confidence to the current fiscal year, in which the group's unit sales were expected to surpass the 2-million mark for the first time in company history.

"We also expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions," Reithofer added.

As a result of its 2013 earnings, BMW announced a higher dividend of 2.60 euros on common shares and 2.62 euros on preference shares.

uhe/mz (AP, dpa)###3803||In an echo of the Cold War, MasterCard and Visa have stopped processing payments by some Russian banks after the United States issued sanctions over Russia's recent annexation of Crimea.

A MasterCard representative says the brand has pulled out of Rossiya, Sobinbank and SMP Bank, but is still doing business with all other Russian banks. Reps from Visa could not be reached for comment. RT reports that Visa has also cut off SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank; both credit card companies are no longer working with Rossiya Bank. The latter issued a statement apologizing to users.

"The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them," the bank said in a statement to RT.

U.S. officials told The Guardian that Rossiya Bank, a favorite of the Kremlin, will be "frozen out of the dollar." The U.S. Treasury Department has named 20 Russian officials and billionaires, some of whom are President Vladimir Putin's closest friends, in its sanctions. The move freezes assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. banks from doing business with those on the list.

In light of the sanctions, which were announced earlier this week, Standard and Poor's downgraded Russia’s long-term credit rating, citing “heightened geopolitical risk and the prospect of U.S. and E.U. economic sanctions.”###3804||The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin's entourage.

Fears over Russia's economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country annexed Crimea following Sunday's hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin's inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin's chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin's lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury's sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia's 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services "without prior notification." SMP's co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia's top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard's actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won't be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank's. They can also get cash directly inside their banks' branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country's central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to "take the bank's clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them."

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin's close entourage, as "just an average bank," Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one "first thing on Monday" and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia's central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. "does not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor's in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia's debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia's BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country's borrowing costs more expensive.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov lambasted the move, saying it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

Have You Saved $2,500 Lately?

President Obama recently admitted that ObamaCare will cause some Americans to lose their doctors. Some have suggested that his promise “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” should be 2014’s “Lie of the Year.” But what about his promise that ObamaCare would lower premiums by $2,500 per family?

As we—what’s the opposite of celebrate?—the fourth anniversary of ObamaCare’s passage this weekend, Americans have already seen their premiums double or even triple. And premiums aren’t finished going up. Next year’s rates won’t be released until this summer, but The Hill recently spoke to insurance company officials and got a frightful preview of where they’re headed. One “insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange.” More…

EUR/SEK touched a two-week low at 8.8191 at 10:38 GMT, after which the pair consolidated at 8.8239, losing 0.22% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 5th low, 8.8130, while resistance was to be encountered at March 17th high, 8.8932.

Economic sentiment in the largest euro area economy, Germany, deteriorated sharply, reaching a 7-month low in March, data by the ZEW Centre for Economic Research showed today.

The ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung), reported that its index of German economic sentiment slid by 9.1 basis points to reach 46.4 this month, the weakest level since August, from a reading of 55.7 in February. At the same time, analysts had expected a smaller drop by 2.7 basis points to 53.0 this month.

In addition, the euro area economic sentiment also registered a decline, coming in at 61.5 in March, down from 68.5 in the previous month and as analysts projected the index will decline to 67.3 this month.

Meanwhile, demand for the Swedish krona was pressured earlier in the day, after it became clear that the board committee of Scania AB, recommended its minority owners to decline a bid by the German Volkswagen AG to buy the rest of Sweden’s truck maker. The board committee of Scania regarded that Volkswagen’s 6.7 billion-euro offer for the rest of the company too low.

Elsewhere, EUR/GBP fell from a session high at 0.8385, recorded at 8:01 GMT, also the pair’s highest point since December 27th, to trade at 0.8366 at 10:03 GMT, dipping 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 0.8342, while resistance was to be met at December 27th high, 0.8393.###3811||Empty###3812||Walmart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) must believe that it actually is the dominant force in everyday low prices. It means to prove that point by offering customers the prices that its competitors charge. While the program has its risks, it may also prove the no other retailer can match the bulk of its discounts.

According to a report:

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form a store credit. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

Customers register online, and then put in the tag number of their receipts into a database which spiders prices from advertising posted by Walmart’s competitors. Clothing and electronics products will not be part of the program. However, the matching system will work by market, so customers actually have a practical means of using the program

Of course, “Savings Catcher” could trigger price wars — and drive down the profits of any retail which wishes to use discounts to draw customers. Walmart has the advantage of its balance sheet and low cost of doing business. It is among the U.S. companies which pays its employees the least.

Walmart has good reason to take the risk. Same store-sales and revenue in the United States have stagnated. It also has had trouble openings stores in the nation’s largest cities, where there is political pressure from smaller retailers to keep Walmart out. Its stock price has been stuck in a range of $70 to $81 for about a year. The stock closed Friday at $76.10 but is down 3.3% this year.

Walmart has taken a chance with “Savings Catcher.” However, it does not have many other means to improve its embattled store sales.###3813||Why did this happen?

Email

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: " After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: " The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."###3815||A Tuesday evening report from CNN cites an anonymous source who said that the U.S. Department of Justice and Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) have reached a settlement in the criminal investigation of the sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles. The company recalled more than 8 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010 after reports of sudden, unintended acceleration that may have been responsible for 75 fatal accidents that killed 93 people.

According to CNN, Toyota will pay more than $1 billion to settle the criminal investigation in a deal that could be announced as soon as Wednesday. The company has already paid out billions of dollars to settle civil claims related to the accidents.

The Justice Department investigation was initiated to determine what Toyota knew and when it knew it. The company’s public statements and disclosures to regulators were found to be misleading at least, and the unprecedented size of the settlement should be a warning shot across the bow of General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM).

GM’s recent recalls of 1.6 million vehicles to repair a problem with the vehicles’ ignition switch has all the hallmarks of a series of questionable public statements and even more questionable company decisions going to 2003. So far 13 deaths and numerous injuries have been attributed to the ignition switch defect.

Toyota stock closed down 0.76% on Tuesday, at $109.83 in a 52-week range of $99.70 to $134.94.

GM stock closed up 1.56% to $35.17 and added another 0.23% in after-hours trading. The stock’s 52-week range is $27.11 to $41.85.###3816||The unemployment rate in Southwest Florida edged upward by nearly a half-percentage point in January to 6.1 percent — the result of post-holiday job cuts coupled with more workers looking for jobs.



But analysts were buoyed by the numbers because they reflected positive economic movement.



“We know there were employers hiring only for the holiday season and that those workers have been laid off,” said Margie Genter, who oversees eight Goodwill Job Connection offices in Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee and DeSoto counties. “But we also know there are more jobs available, so that people who had given up their job search are coming back into the job market.”



Statistics released Monday by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity show that more people, encouraged by what they consider an improving labor market, have re-entered the job pool at a time when payroll positions also are on the rise.



At the end of January, the labor force in the three-county area was 385,813, up 3,754 workers from a month earlier.



At the same time, payrolls got a little bigger. The number of employed workers rose by 2,040, to 362,286.



Statewide, the department reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, down two-tenths of a point from a revised December rate of 6.3 percent and nearly 2 percentage points better than the 8 percent of a year earlier.



Florida, overall, has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That was third best in the nation, trailing just Texas and California, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.



In issuing figures for January, the state also revised its numbers for 2013, replacing rougher survey numbers with more accurate job counts.



That yearly process, called bench-marking, showed Florida payrolls at 7.68 million at year end, up 35,600 from an earlier estimate.



Economists were generally encouraged by the report.



“Two-thousand thirteen looked better than it did originally, as far as job creation,” said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida.



The year-end numbers “confirm our story line, which has been a positive outlook, a fairly strong rebound in Florida and in the Sarasota area as well,” said Mekael Teshome, an economist at PNC Financial Services who tracks Florida’s economy.



He said housing and consumer spending, which have led Florida’s recovery, should continue to do well.



“But we are now seeing more balanced growth, across industries both small and large,” Teshome said.



Demand for workers has continued to grow even as the statewide and regional unemployment rate has hovered around 6 percent for months.



“There has definitely been an upshift, a swing, where we are seeing more employers, even those we worked with in years past, come forward and start to hire,” said Jennifer Kochilaris, regional vice president for job placement firm Adecco USA. “That shows us the trend is continuing on the right path here in Sarasota.”



Manufacturing has been a bright spot for the region’s economy, as well.



“In this area, production is booming," said Nancee Sussman, who runs the Sarasota office of Swanson Staffing. “We are seeing them starting second and third shifts, which is good.”



Construction, too, has come back significantly.



Home builders are finding workers “are not available in this area in the quantities that we need,” said Alan Anderson, executive vice president of the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association. “Electricians, dry-wallers, HVAC, plumbers. There are some framing concerns as well.”



Local builders are having a tough time competing now with other markets nationally for skilled trades, especially because so many of those workers left the region during the housing crash, Anderson said.



Florida added 32,700 construction jobs in the 12 months ended in January, more than any other state, according to data released Monday by the Associated General Contractors of America.



But 37 other states grew their construction payrolls in the year’s first month as well, the association said.



“Especially considering the fact that many parts of the country experienced very harsh weather in January, these construction jobs figures are particularly robust,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist.



In Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties, more than 23,500 residents were looking for work in January, statistics show.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent, as compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County’s rate rose by a 0.5 percentage point to 6.2 percent, from 5.7 percent.



Manatee experienced the smallest increase and had the region’s lowest jobless rate in January: 5.9 percent, as compared with 5.8 percent in December.

EARLIER: The unemployment rate in Southwest Florida climbed nearly a half-percentage point during January to 6.1 percent, likely the result of job cuts following the holiday season and more workers looking for jobs.



Unemployed workers who are not actively looking for a job are not counted in the unemployment rate. That has been responsible for part of the significant decline in the jobless rate during the recovery from the Great Recession: discouraged workers who have given up.



But evidence that more workers might be looking was found in the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity's total work force count for the region released on Monday.



There were 385,813 people counted, up nearly 1 percent, or 3,754, from the same tally in December.



The state counted 23,527 workers looking for work in January for the 6.1 percent unemployment figure. The jobless rate was 5.7 percent during December.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County rate rose 0.5 percentage points to 6.2 percent from 5.7 percent.



Manatee saw the smallest increase and had the region's lowest jobless rate during January: 5.9 percent compared with 5.8 percent in December.###3817||(Recasts, adds Royal Mint director comments)

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain plans to replace its 1-pound coin with a new version modelled on the country’s historic threepenny piece, finance minister George Osborne will announce later on Wednesday.

The new pound’s proposed twelve-sided shape composed of two different coloured metals will help with efforts to crack down on fake currency, the finance ministry said.

“After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current 1-pound coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” Osborne said in a statement.

He will formally notify Britain’s lawmakers of the proposed new coin, to be introduced in 2017, as part of his annual budget announcement in parliament.

The current pound has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the finance ministry said, with about 3 percent of all 1-pound coins, or 45 million, believed to be forgeries. That figure rises to 6 percent in some parts of the country.

The new coin will be armed with new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology developed by the Royal Mint, the maker of Britain’s coins whose history dates back over 1,100 years.

“We think it’s suitably British,” the Royal Mint’s director of circulation Andrew Mills told BBC Radio. “It’s very reminiscent of two other British coins. The twelve-sided shape is very reminiscent of the threepenny bit and secondly, of course, it doesn’t look that dissimilar to the 2-pound coin.”

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle.

A public consultation will be held over the summer to consider the metal composition and to weigh up the impact of the new-shaped coin on different stakeholders such as vending machines operators.

MOSCOW, March 21 (RAPSI) – Visa and MasterCard payment systems on Friday blocked operations with SMP Bank owned by Russian businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenbergs added to a list of targeted economic sanctions by the United States on Thursday, according to the bank’s statement.

On Thursday, the Rotenberg brothers were included in the economic sanctions list imposed against Russian officials over the Ukrainian developments. Arkady Rotenberg heads SMP Bank’s board of directors, and owns a 38% share. A similar share is owned by his brother Boris Rotendberg.

The new sanctions were in response to a vote held Thursday in Russia’s parliament ratifying the reunification of Crimea with Russia after 60 years as part of Ukraine. A referendum in the region held Sunday saw voters overwhelmingly support leaving Ukraine and joining Russia.

Along with Rotenberg brothers, who are presumed to have close ties with Vladimir Putin, the sacntions were imposed against Andrei Fursenko, presidential aide; Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office; Sergei Mironov, Duma lawmaker and leader of A Just Russia party; Sergey Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian State Duma; and businessman Gennady Timchenko.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this month that sanctions against Russia threatened to cause mutual damage in the modern, integrated global economy.

The US and EU announced asset freezes and travel bans targeting a number of Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin on Monday, following Crimea’s referendum.

Crimea, previously an autonomous republic within Ukraine, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government in Kiev that came to power amid often violent protests last month and sought reunification with Russia.###3819||Empty###3820||Empty###3821||Doh! 404!

The Department of Labor says the preliminary jobless rate for January was the same as the December rate. The unemployment rate of 6.1 percent represents 130,444 people without jobs.

The rate is down considerably from a year earlier. The jobless rate for January 2013 was 6.7 percent. The number of people working in the state in January increased from 1.98 million in December to 1.99 million in January.

Labor Commissioner Tom Surtees says the state saw growth in the labor force and an increase in the number of people working, which are good signs.###
