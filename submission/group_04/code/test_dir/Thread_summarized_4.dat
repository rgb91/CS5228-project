The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.
John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.
“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said.
"However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance.
If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###2555||Empty###2556||Deals Rumor Mill: Airbnb, Strauss-Kahn, WhampoaLaw360, New York (March 20, 2014, 1:26 PM EDT) -- Popular home-rental startup Airbnb Inc. is nearing a deal that would infuse it with between $400 million and $500 million in new funding, throttling its valuation past the $10 billion mark,...To view the full article, register now.###2557||Walmart getting into used games business Walmart has announced that it will be accepting trade-in games for store credit starting next week, and will begin selling used games later this year.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal.
In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent.
Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement.
These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.
Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target.
If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.
The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned.
Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.###2574||Wall Street leaders including Lloyd Blankfein and James Gorman, who have courted business in Vladimir Putin's Russia, are facing a dilemma as tensions over Ukraine escalate.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer.
And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.
The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said.
