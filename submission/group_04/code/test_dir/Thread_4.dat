2553||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

Elsewhere, insurance and gambling stocks dragged on the FTSE 100 yesterday following chancellor George Osborne’s Budget.

Among the hardest hit were Legal & General, which ended the day down 8.2 per cent, Partnership Assurance which fell 55 per cent and Aviva which was down 5.2 per cent yesterday.

Gambling stocks William Hill and Ladbrokes also dropped 6.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent and have continued to drop this morning in early trading.###2554||While the initial reaction to today's news that Wal-Mart is going after the used video game business has GameStop's shares trading lower, one analyst who has covered Grapevine-based GameStop isn't too worried.It's not going to be easy for Wal-Mart to steal the used video game business from GameStop, said Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.“We note that this is not the first time Wal-Mart will be trying this. In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance. If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###2555||Empty###2556||Deals Rumor Mill: Airbnb, Strauss-Kahn, Whampoa

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###2558||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Royal Mint's Andrew Mills says introducing the £1 coin could cost £20m

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

Image copyright George Osborne/Twitter Image caption Mr Osborne posted this picture on Twitter on Wednesday morning

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###2560||Empty###2561||Originally published March 21, 2014 at 6:14 AM | Page modified March 22, 2014 at 3:26 AM

Interactive: What we know so far

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia —

Malaysia's defense minister says a Chinese satellite has spotted a large object along a broad stretch of ocean where officials hope to find a Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing for more than two weeks.

Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 30 meters (100 feet).

He said, "The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify."

He said he had no other information and that China would release further details. It was not immediately clear whether the object was seen near where another satellite found two objects earlier this week.

Astonishingly, that would rank the company ahead of hotel chains like Hyatt, InterContental and Wyndham, companies that own substantial physical assets and have thousands of rooms available around the planet. Hyatt, for example, owns 500 properties in 46 countries.

Funding at a $10-billion valuation would also make Airbnb Inc. one of the most highly valued venture-capital-backed startups on the planet, alongside cloud storage company Dropbox and Chinese mobile internet company Xiaomi. One of the world’s preeminent private equity firms, TPG, is likely to lead the funding round, according to the Journal.###2563||Empty###2564||Empty###2565||Empty###2566||Empty###2567||Empty###2568||Empty###2569||Empty###2570||Empty###2571||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###2572||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2573||Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz###2574||Wall Street leaders including Lloyd Blankfein and James Gorman, who have courted business in Vladimir Putin's Russia, are facing a dilemma as tensions over Ukraine escalate.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

(See also: Investors not buying gold bounce despite Ukraine tension)

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. Other retailers offer to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Wendy’s beginning mobile pay option

NEW YORK – Wendy’s is rolling out a program that lets customers pay using their smartphones, following similar plans unveiled by Burger King earlier this week.

The Wendy’s Co., based in Dublin, Ohio, has been testing the mobile payment option over the past year and said the majority of its roughly 5,800 U.S. locations are now ready to accept the payments.

The move reflects a push by fast-food chains to court younger customers by tapping into the attachment they have to their phones.

Burger King Worldwide Inc. said this week it would introduce a mobile payment program at its U.S. restaurants in April.

Shrimp costs putting hurt on Red Lobster

ORLANDO, Fla. – A spike in shrimp costs is causing trouble for Red Lobster.

Parent company Darden has been fighting for some time to win back customers at its Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains as more affordable alternatives such as Chipotle have gained in popularity.

But in recent months, higher shrimp costs have become another factor weighing on Red Lobster. Chief Financial Officer Brad Richmond says the company is facing a $30 million increase in shrimp costs on an annual basis.

The Orlando-based company on Friday reported a lower quarterly profit due to weak sales at its Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains.

Darden has said it will spin off or sell Red Lobster to focus its attention on fixing Olive Garden.

Families sue GM over faulty ignition switch

DETROIT – The families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 Wisconsin car crash are suing General Motors, alleging that the company was negligent in designing its small cars and committed fraud by not disclosing facts about the defects.

Natasha Weigel, who was 18, and Amy Rademaker, who was 15, died after the October 2006 crash involving a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt compact car with a faulty ignition switch. The car’s driver, Megan Phillips, suffered permanent brain damage, according to a statement from the families’ law firm.

GM failed to warn the teens of a dangerous defect and misrepresented the car’s safety, said lawyer Robert Hilliard in a statement. The firm said the lawsuit was filed Friday in Hennepin County, Minn., where the car was purchased.

The crash was among the first blamed on the faulty ignition switches. Last month GM recalled 1.6 million Cobalts and other small cars worldwide to replace the switches. The company has admitted knowing about the problem for at least 11 years before taking the action.###2584||Empty###2585||Investing.com - Gold prices fell on Tuesday after Russia assured the world it wasn't out to annex Ukraine, while mixed data in the U.S. failed to convince investors the Federal Reserve was more likely to delay the pace at which it dismantles stimulus programs.

Gold has served as a safe haven of choice during the Ukraine crisis.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,356.20 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 1.22%, up from a session low of $1,351.20 and off a high of $1,368.40.

The April contract settled down 0.44% at $1,372.90 on Monday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,328.20 a troy ounce, the low from March 10, and resistance at $1,393.80, the high from Sept. 8.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine," suggesting that Russia's moves in the area would be limited.

The speech came one day after President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters opting to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy.

Elsewhere, mixed U.S. housing data failed to boost gold prices.

The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.

The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase.

U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

After digesting the data, investors viewed the numbers as strong enough to keep the Fed cutting its monthly bond purchases, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery, making gold an attractive hedge.

Currently, the Fed is purchasing $65 billion Treasury bonds and mortgage debt a month, though many expect the U.S. central bank to trim that figure to $55 billion at a policy meeting on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 2.09% at US$20.830 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were up 0.03% at US$2.953 a pound.###2586||It may not buy you much these days but is the pound in your pocket actually worth anything at all?

With an estimated £45m fake £1 coins in circulation the Royal Mint is set to introduce a new 12-sided version which it says is designed to be the "most secure in the world".

The coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about how easy it is to counterfeit the current 30-year-old design.

The Royal Mint believes 3% of existing £1 coins are fake, and that the move to update the coin will increase "public confidence" in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

So, with all these worthless coins floating around the currency system how do you know if you've got one?

Depending on the quality of the counterfeit coin they may be easy to spot. Indistinct lettering or the wrong typeface on the edge of the coin is the most obvious give away.

The Queen's head and the pattern on the reverse of the coin should both be upright when the coin is turned over.

A fake coin can also be slightly different in colour. The markings on the coin could also be 'soapy' - an industry term to describe blurred and indistinct details.

The Royal Mint has issued guidance on how to spot one of the 3% of coins that could be fake as follows:

The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.

The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.

The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.

Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.

The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.

The six-year-old San Francisco start-up epitomizes the sharing economy, by allowing people to rent out unused rooms in their home — or entire islands and castles — to anyone looking for a place to crash.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the funding negotiations, detailing that private equity firm TPG is likely to lead the round. If successful, Airbnb will become one of the richest young tech companies around.

Based on the most recent information available, Airbnb operates in 192 countries and has more than 600,000 current listings. Hosts set a nightly rate, and Airbnb collects a percentage of the payment. It does not disclose its revenues.

While being able to raise that kind of loot is impressive, Airbnb will be under the gun to find a lucrative way of investing the cash to create enough value for investors when it exits. One challenge that it faces — which will no doubt be expensive — is the company’s fights with public officials, who are asking whether it is violating local regulations.

These setbacks are common for companies in the sharing economy, with other start-ups, like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar facing increased scrutiny around the globe.

The sheer size of the round makes this deal outstanding, but what’s potentially more startling is how Airbnb will rank among its publicly held peers once the deal is compete (of course, negotiations can always break down and the deal may never materialize).

Check out how a $10 billion valuation compares to some of the leading hotel chains and booking sites’ current market caps:

— Expedia: $9.8 billion.

— HomeAway: $3.9 billion.

— Wyndham Worldwide: $9.3 billion.

— Hyatt Hotels: $8.43 billion.

— Priceline: $68.6 billion.

— Orbitz: $878 million.###2588||Empty###2589||Exterior view of Symantec Corp. headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in December 2004. (Photo: Paul Sakuma, AP)

Shares of Symantec sunk 9.4% in pre-market trading Friday after the computer security firm surprised investors by firing its CEO.

On Thursday, Symantec announced it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett. Board member Michael Brown will fill his role on an interim basis while a special committee begins a search for a new CEO.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement representing Symantec's board of directors.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Symantec is sticking with its fourth-quarter forecast, which has the company raking in between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion in revenue.

Bennett's firing marks another tumble for Symantec shares since reaching a 52-week high of $26.96 on August 13. In pre-market trading, shares are below $20. The last time Symantec stock closed under $20 was January 2013.

A website that offers homes for rent is understood to be embarking on a fundraising that could value it at $10 billion — more than some of the established hotel chains it competes against.

The new money would catapult Airbnb into the ranks of the world’s most valuable start-ups, along with the likes of WhatsApp, which was snapped up last month by Facebook for $19 billion, and Dropbox, the online storage provider that was recently valued at $10 billion.

Airbnb operates by putting travellers seeking a place to stay in contact with people with a house or room to rent.

COLUMBIA, S.C. - South Carolina's unemployment went down in January for the eighth month in a row, dipping to 6.4 percent, state officials said Monday.

The drop, announced by the Department of Employment and Workforce, is down from December's jobless rate of 6.6 percent. That mark, state officials said then, was the first time in more than a decade that South Carolina's unemployment had been below the national rate.

Nationally, unemployment was 6.6 percent in January, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. South Carolina's rate was tied with four other states for 21st-highest in the nation.

In January, the number of employed people in South Carolina reached a record high of nearly 2,031,000. That's an increase of more than 22,000 people over the past year.

Nonagricultural jobs in South Carolina went down by 4,800 in January but are up by 37,000 compared with a year ago, according to state officials.

Over the last month, only two sectors - education and health services and information - posted job gains, with a total of 500 jobs. Since January 2013, those sectors are up by 5,200 jobs.

Jobless rates went up in all but three of South Carolina's 46 counties in January. Marion County had the state's highest unemployment, at 13.6 percent. Jobless rates were lowest in Lexington County, at 5.1 percent.

"Today's news is a real testament to the hard working people of South Carolina and another sign that we are continuing to move in the right direction," Gov. Nikki Haley said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Russian Federation should sign an accession treaty, according to the government website, Bloomberg reported. He is expected to take a statement in front of lawmakers and regional leaders later in the day in Moscow.

European Union’s foreign ministers reached an agreement to freeze assets and impose visa travel bans on 21 Russians and Crimeans, while the United States imposed similar sanctions on seven Russian government officials and four others from Ukraine.

The preliminary results from Crimea’s referendum on March 16th revealed that 96% of voters in the Black Sea peninsula supported leaving Ukraine and joining Russia.

Meanwhile, the Aussie received brief support against its major peers earlier on Tuesday, after the Reserve Bank of Australia published the minutes from its policy meeting on March 4th, where the bank decided to leave borrowing costs unchanged at the record low level of 2.50%.

“There were further signs that low interest rates were providing support to activity,” according to the minutes. “The most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.”

“The decline in the exchange rate seen to date would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards,” as noted in the RBA minutes.

For a eurosceptic government to turn the pound coin into something that looks like a euro is, frankly, a little bit bizarre.

News of this new pound coin is far more important to ordinary people than the austerity-limited tweaks to the tax system contained in today’s Budget.

‘After 30 years’ loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin,’ declares George Osborne.

The chancellor may have succumbed to Treasury madness. It’s just a coin, not a civil servant. We must pay close attention to make sure all the old £1 coins are not given pensions.

The old circular British pound is now to be replaced by something that looks like the brainchild of a mad scientist cross-breeding a 50p and a euro. It’s a jagged two-tone affair which will be virtually impossible to roll away when you drop it on the floor in the pub. Where’s the fun in that?

Such an important decision isn’t being taken lightly. It’s actually a deliberate ploy by the Conservatives to try and appeal to Ukip-voting traditionalists. Or, as Osborne says in the press release issued by the Royal Mint:

I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit.

Personally I have no idea what the threepenny bit looks like. Nor, in all likelihood, does anyone who’s reading this on a smartphone.

But we’re not the target audience for this particular bit of politicking, are we? The Tories are desperate to win over the wrinkly vote and, as this demonstrates, are prepared to try anything to make more youthfully-challenged voters feel good.

So let’s hope, for Osborne’s sake, that the coin doesn’t get mixed up with the euro.

Tories fought to prevent Britain from having a coin like this… (Picture:: McXas/McXas)

The fuss surrounding this new design calls into question the unveiling of the London 2012 logo. That was panned for being stupid. But we all got used to it and in the end we realised how clever and cool it was.

Something tells me the designers of this new pound won’t be quite as forward-looking as those who worked on the Olympics, however.

The ‘tails’ of the coin is also up for grabs. The design for the reverse is obviously going to be critical and will be the subject of a consultation.

Renting out that room to travelers isn't a billion dollar idea.

It's a $10 billion idea.

Airbnb, the web-based "home rental marketplace," is in fundraising talks with captains of capital, which could lead to a $10 billion valuation of the company, the Wall Street Journal first reported.

That would be a value higher than "real" hotels. Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Wyndham Worldwide are worth $8.43 billion and $9.39 billion respectively, Reuters reported.

TPG Capital Management LP is one of the private equity firms in fundraising talks with the San Francisco-based tech giant, Reuters reported.

TPG also invested a large sum in Uber, another tech darling of the so-called "sharing economy."

Airbnb continues to be popular despite scrutiny from governments in New York State and in San Francisco, where its legality is questioned, the news source reported.

The images, which have not been shared with the press, show "potential objects" located in the same area where Australia and China had also found suspected debris from the plane.

Though Malaysian officials are being tight-lipped about what exactly the satellite images show, the Associated Press was told that the images were "captured Friday and pinpointed objects about 930 kilometers (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located."

The Treasury has said the new coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about the current £1 coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting.

"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," said a Treasury spokesman.

The new coin is based on the design of the old three-penny piece, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

Chancellor George Osborne tweeted an image of the coin ahead of today's Budget.

The Royal Mint, which believes three per cent of existing £1 coins are fake, said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and ultimately reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

However, the Royal Mint's director of circulation, Andrew Mills, has said it is "a likelihood" that every vending machine will have to change to fit the coin.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mills said the cost to the economy over the next three years for changes to vending machines and trolleys will be around £15m to £20m.

He added that it was important to look at the benefits of the coin and said that the Royal Mint will be consulting with the Automatic Vending Association and other industries to ensure the changeover runs as "smoothly as possible".

The current pound coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing out of the pound note, which was withdrawn five years later.

The new coin will be bi-metallic and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be authenticated at all points. While the Queen's head will be on one side of the coin, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.###2613||Empty###2614||MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged support on Friday to a secretive bank long-associated with the Kremlin that was hit by U.S. sanctions and which serves clients in Russia's energy sector, including businesses owned by Gazprom.

Bank Rossiya, and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk, were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, played down his association with the bank, but ordered the central bank to support the lender.

“And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand, it is a medium-sized bank,” he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council. “I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday.”

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

Little has been known about Bank Rossiya, which has risen to become the country's 15th largest bank by assets last year from 54th in just six years.

Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder in the St Petersburg-based bank is a close Putin ally. The friendship between the two dates back to the early 1990s, when Putin served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

Kovalchuk was also one of the three founding members of the Ozero (Lake) luxury dachas complex outside St Petersburg who were targeted by the U.S. sanctions

“Kovalchuk … Timchenko … I think I need to stay away from them,” Putin joked on Friday.

The bank's operations are concentrated around St Petersburg and Moscow, serving chiefly clients in oil, gas and energy. The bank also controls large insurance firms Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

“Our companies will continue using the services of the bank,” a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

The bank paid 106.5 roubles ($2.94) per ordinary share in dividends on 2012 earnings for a total payout of 267.1 million roubles ($7.37 million), suggesting that Kovalchuk got $1 million in dividends for his stake.

According to a 2008 article by the business daily Vedomosti, nearly 4 percent of the bank belonged to a distant cousin of Putin, Mikhail Shelomov.

One of the bank's clients, the state electricity holding firm InterRAO is run by Kovalchuk's son Boris Kovalchuk.

“We have small rouble deposits and an insignificant loan burden, in both roubles and foreign currency, but settlements for the latter are made in roubles,” Anton Nazarov, a representative of InteRAO told Reuters, without disclosing the amounts.

Three of the bank's clients, the utility holdings FSK , Moscow United Electric Grid Co. (MOESK) and the grid company Rosseti, told Reuters they hold only rouble accounts at the bank.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following Washington's sanctions. Western Union the world's largest money transfer company, has also suspended its services for the bank.

“The bank has a strong liquidity cushion and the imposed sanctions will not affect the company's operations,” Bank Rossiya said in a statement late on Friday.

“Currently, there is no area (of the bank's operation) that would require assistance from the Central Bank.”

The Russian central bank said that it stood ready to support the sanctions-hit bank. “If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors,” it said in a statement.###2615||From the Tampa Bay Times' Jeff Harrington:

Florida lost 2,600 jobs in January, led by workforce drops in retail, hotels, restaurants and healthcare.

The reversal came even as the state's unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping from an upwardly adjusted 6.3 percent in December to 6.1 percent in January.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is in Orlando this morning, announced the news via a Twitter link to a brief YouTube video. In the clip, he touted that unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since June 2008. But Scott made no mention of the retraction in jobs.

The unemployment rate and jobs numbers don't always mesh, in part because they're drawn from two different surveys. The jobless rate is taken from a household survey measuring people who say they either have a job or are actively looking for one. The jobs number comes from employers.

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain plans to replace its 1-pound coin with a new version modelled on the country’s historic threepenny piece, finance minister George Osborne will announce later on Wednesday.

The new pound’s proposed twelve-sided shape composed of two different coloured metals will help with efforts to crack down on fake currency, the finance ministry said.

“After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current 1-pound coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” Osborne said in a statement.

He will formally notify Britain’s lawmakers of the proposed new coin, to be introduced in 2017, as part of his annual budget announcement in parliament.

The current pound has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the finance ministry said, with about 3 percent of all 1-pound coins, or 45 million, believed to be forgeries. That figure rises to 6 percent in some parts of the country.

The new coin will be armed with new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology developed by the Royal Mint, the maker of Britain’s coins whose history dates back over 1,100 years.

“We think it’s suitably British,” the Royal Mint’s director of circulation Andrew Mills told BBC Radio. “It’s very reminiscent of two other British coins. The twelve-sided shape is very reminiscent of the threepenny bit and secondly, of course, it doesn’t look that dissimilar to the 2-pound coin.”

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle.

A public consultation will be held over the summer to consider the metal composition and to weigh up the impact of the new-shaped coin on different stakeholders such as vending machines operators.

The financing will bring in several hundred million dollars, though the final amount hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal remains in flux. The San Francisco-based company, backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was valued at $2.5 billion in 2012.

Airbnb confirmed last week it would open a Portland outpost with 160 employees to start, and with more hires likely to follow.

At $10 billion, Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, which includes Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It would also be worth more than twice as much as publicly traded vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc.

A slew of technology startups have lately raised huge rounds of financing at increasing valuations, as corporate investors, hedge funds and mutual funds seek stakes in companies before they go public. Messaging application TangoMe Inc. today raised $280 million from investors led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in a deal that values the startup at more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this week, Cloudera Inc. said it raised $160 million, with more set to come from investors including Intel Corp., people with knowledge of the situation said.

Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb lets users rent out a couch, bedroom or house and makes money by charging a fee for each transaction. The company has listings in more than 34,000 cities, according to its website.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”###2621||Getty Images

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s namesake U.S. unit, seeking to combat slowing store traffic and reverse its fourth straight quarterly same-store sales decline, announced that will begin offering store credit for used videogames at its physical stores.

Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT , which started testing its plan to accept used games online last year, said it wants a share of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S., currently dominated by No. 1 videogame retailer GameStop Corp. /quotes/zigman/389699/delayed /quotes/nls/gme GME Other retailers, including Best Buy /quotes/zigman/219712/delayed /quotes/nls/bby BBY , also buy used videogames.

Its competitive advantage, Wal-Mart said, is that shoppers can use store credit from trade-ins to buy its wide variety of goods at both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

“We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton told reporters on a call, adding the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an “inflection point” following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year. “There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment.”

The company, which already accepts trade-ins of pre-owned tablets and smartphones, said it will refurbish the pre-owned games for resale. The trade-in program doesn’t include hardware consoles.

Wal-Mart, citing research firm NPD Group, said it’s already the No. 2 U.S. seller of new physical videogame software and hardware. It said there are almost 1 billion units of used videogames that are sitting around in customers’ homes.

While getting more of the 110 million gamers into its stores looks like a safe bet at a time when the company is seeking to increase traffic, it remains to be seen how big of an impact its entry may be. The videogame industry, faced with competition from digital games played on mobile phones and the Internet, has been in decline. According to NPD Group, total physical sales of videogame software in February saw an 11% drop.

However, the used-game business tends to be more profitable. GameStop has said it’s the largest retailer of pre-owned videogames in the world, and that its used game business — with an average price of $19 — generates higher gross margins than do new game sales, with an average price of $41.

With Wal-Mart’s entry, GameStop shares fell 5% on Tuesday in their biggest percentage decline since January. GameStop said in its most recent annual filing that its trade-in program, with about 3,100 game titles, gives it a “unique value proposition” because such purchases are generally unavailable at mass merchants, toy stores and consumer-electronics retailers.

“We see this announcement as a profitability concern more than a market share concern” for GameStop, said Stifel analyst David Schick, adding pre-owned business represented 26% of GameStop’s sales and 42% of its gross profit the last 12 months.

Mt. Gox, the embattled Japanese Bitcoin exchange that was hacked and filed for bankruptcy last month, said Thursday it found 200,000 Bitcoins held in an "old format wallet." CEO Mark Karpeles issued a statement on the Mt. Gox website claiming that the digital wallet was found while researching wallets used before June 2011.The wallet accounts for 24 percent of the total holdings the company had when the site crashed, losing more than $450 million in total value. At today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million. According to CNN Money, when the company filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo and the U.S. it filed with debts totaling $64 million.The company says it reported the finding to the bankruptcy court March 10, and had moved the bitcoins to offline, or "cold," storage by March 15.The new development is likely to cause a flare-up among the customers whose money has been lost since the crash. Mt. Gox was one of the biggest exchanges in the world when it stopped customers from withdrawing money, blaming the disruption on technical troubles and cyber attacks.Investors hold out little hope they will get their money back, as Japan had not regulated the exchange, and no deposit insurance was offered.Several other exchanges and Bitcoin banks sought to reassure their own investors and account holders after the crash, among them the U.S.-based Coinbase, which has more than 1 million consumer wallets.In a joint industry statement, the founders of Coinbase wrote, "As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. ... We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age."Mt. Gox did confirm privately some of their technical issues with fellow industry players who signed the joint statement, and software developers who collectively run the Bitcoin protocol also fixed a few of issues the company initially cited as contributing factors in the failure.###2627||* Malaysia minister says objects are a “credible lead”

* Australian PM says search planes investigating potential debris

* Objects about 2,500 km southwest of Perth

* Norwegian merchant vessel arrives in the search area (Adds search called off for the night)

By Jane Wardell and Siva Govindasamy

SYDNEY/KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Reuters) - Aircraft and ships ploughed through dire weather on Thursday in search of objects floating in remote seas off Australia that Malaysia’s government called a “credible lead” in the trans-continental hunt for a jetliner missing for nearly two weeks.

The large objects, which Australian officials said were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe, are the most promising find in days as searchers scour a vast area for the plane lost with 239 people on board.

A Norwegian merchant ship arrived in the area on Thursday, but officials cautioned it could take days to confirm if the objects were parts of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777. Malaysia’s government said the search would continue elsewhere despite the sighting in the southern Indian Ocean.

The area where the objects were spotted is around 2,500 km (1,500 miles) southwest of Perth, roughly corresponding to the far end of a southern track that investigators calculated the aircraft could have taken after it was diverted.

“Yesterday I said that we wanted to reduce the area of the search. We now have a credible lead,” Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

A search for the plane that began in the tropical waters off Malaysia’s east coast has now switched to the vast, icy southern oceans between Australia, southern Africa and Antarctica.

Two Royal Australia Air Force AP-3C Orions, a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon and a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion were involved in Thursday’s search which was called off late in the evening and will resume on Friday.

There have been many false leads and no confirmed wreckage found from Flight MH370 since it vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

Hishammuddin said the information on the objects received from Australia had been “corroborated to a certain extent” by other satellites, making it more credible than previous leads.

The larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres (79 ft), long and appeared to be floating in water several thousand metres deep, Australian officials said. The second object was about five metres (16 feet) long. Arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water.

“It’s credible enough to divert the research to this area on the basis it provides a promising lead to what might be wreckage from the debris field,” Royal Australian Air Force Air Commodore John McGarry told a news conference in Canberra.

The satellite images, provided by U.S. company DigitalGlobe , were taken on March 16, meaning that the possible debris could by now have drifted far from the original site.

Australian officials said an aircraft had dropped a series of marker buoys in the area, which will provide information about currents to assist in calculating the latest location.

The captain of the first Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane to return from the search area described the weather conditions as “extremely bad” with rough seas and high winds.

A Norwegian car carrier diverted from its journey from Madagascar to Melbourne and had arrived in the search area, the ship’s owner said. A Royal Australian Navy ship equipped to recover any objects was also en route.

China’s icebreaker for Antarctic research, Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, will set off from Perth to search the area, Chinese state news agency Xinhua cited maritime authorities as saying. About two-thirds of the 227 passengers on Flight MH370 were Chinese nationals.

BACKGROUND CHECKS

Investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane’s communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course.

Exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have yielded barely anything that might explain why.

The discovery of the floating objects was revealed by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

“The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,” he told parliament.

The dimensions of the objects given are consistent with at least one of them possibly being the major part of a 777-200ER wing, which is around 27 metres (89 feet) long, though Australian officials cautioned the first images were indistinct.

The relatively large size of the objects would suggest that, if they do come from the missing aircraft, it was largely intact when it went into the water.

If the plane had run out of fuel, it would not necessarily have plummeted but its behaviour would have depended on whether there was someone in control and their intentions, pilots said.

Modern aircraft are designed to use the rush of wind to drive a small emergency turbine that keeps hydraulics and some electrical power running if the engines run out of fuel.

If the debris is from the plane, investigators would face a daunting task to retrieve the “black box” data and voice recorders needed to help understand what caused the disaster.

University of Western Australia Professor of Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi said that, based on currents in the area, if the debris is from the plane it probably would have entered the water around 300-400 km (180-250 miles) to the west.

The search area covered an ocean ridge known as Naturalist Plateau, a large sea shelf about 3,500 metres (9,800 feet) deep, Pattiaratchi said. The plateau is about 250 km (150 miles) wide by 400 km (250 miles) long, and the area around it is close to 5,000 metres (16,400 feet) deep.

“Whichever way you go, it’s deep,” Pattiaratchi said.

Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that, minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the Gulf of Thailand, the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established route towards India.

What happened next is unclear, but faint electronic “pings” picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. That would be consistent with the plane ending up in the southern Indian Ocean.

The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, has focused particular attention on the pilot and co-pilot.

The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane, after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month.

A Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigations into the pilots said three simulator games that 53-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had played were being looked at.

“We are following up on the data logs being erased,” the source said. “These could be logs of the games that were erased to free up memory, so it may not lead us to anything. He played a lot of games, going into hundreds and thousands of hours.” (Additional reporting by Tim Hepher, A.

Starting on March 26, gamers can bring their used video games into some 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a credit to spend on anything they want at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores or on the retailer’s website. The video games must be in working condition and in the original packaging, and must be brought to the electronics department where employees will evaluate them and determine a trade-in price. Customers cannot receive cash back for video games.

Walmart executives said they will accept thousands of popular video games for Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintento Wii, and will refurbish them and resell them in stores and online later this year. There more than 880 million video games being played in homes across the country.

Walmart tested a video game trade-in program in 2009 that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud. On a call with media on Monday, executives said that program was shut down and the retailer has since been working to create a simpler and fairer video buy-back system. Last fall, the Arkansas-based retailer also rolled out a trade-in program for smartphones and tablets. Walmart’s partners with CExchange, which refurbishes, recycles and assesses the value of used tech gadgets.

The Obama administration has taken a red pen to its signature health care reform law again — rewriting the measure without consulting Congress.

This time, the White House wants to extend Obamacare’s “risk corridors,” which require the feds to bail out insurance companies if they lose too much money in the law’s exchanges.

Taxpayers can’t afford billions more in unchecked corporate liabilities. Rather than stroke checks to insurers to make up for the huge sums they’ll lose by participating in Obamacare’s exchanges, Congress should scrap the law altogether.

Here’s how the risk corridors work. If an insurer has to pay claims that are 3 percent more than projected, the government must reimburse the insurer for half the excess payments. If claims are 8 percent or more beyond projections, the government reimburses about 75 percent of the losses.

If costs are lower than projected, insurers are supposed to pay the government. Because estimates of Obamacare’s cost have marched steadily upward since the law passed, though, that outcome seems unlikely. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that Obamacare will cost more than $2 trillion through 2024 — more than double its initial projection.

Without the promise of a bailout, many insurers would have been reluctant to sell through the exchanges, due to the high probability of “adverse selection.” That’s the insurance-industry term for having too many old and sick customers — and not enough young and healthy ones.

If that happens, then the insurance risk pools become imbalanced. Insurers end up paying out more in claims than they receive in premiums. If the “selection” is “adverse” enough, the whole system collapses.

Insurers’ fears are increasingly looking justified.

Many Americans have had trouble enrolling because of technical problems with both federal and state exchange websites.

Meanwhile, the president has declared that the approximately 5 million Americans whose policies were cancelled because of Obamacare won’t have to pay tax penalties in 2014 designed to force them into the exchanges. The special dispensation was granted after a public outcry about the president’s promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing coverage under his health reform plan.

Younger Americans are realizing that they’re going to pay higher premiums to subsidize coverage for older Americans, even though the latter group is, on average, wealthier. For millions of young adults, remaining uninsured — whereby they can pay the individual mandate penalty of $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater, starting April 1 — will be cheaper than getting covered. So they’re staying away from the marketplaces.

A December Kaiser Family Foundation report described a 25 percent enrollment rate among 18-34 year olds as a “worst-case scenario” that could cost insurers more than half their profit margin.

That worst-case scenario is now reality. Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Avik Roy notes that “25 percent of non-elderly adults who selected an exchange plan were younger than 35,” according to January data.

Obamacare’s supporters say that they envisioned these hiccups. Indeed, the law plainly states that Obamacare “shall establish and administer a program of risk corridors for calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016” to help the exchanges outlast any growing pains.

We’re just two months into their first year, though, and the White House is already talking about extending them three more years. That means the Obama administration expects the exchanges to be financially unsustainable for at least six years after their launch.

How long are Americans supposed to wait before Obamacare starts working?

Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, isn’t willing to wait any longer. He’s looking to repeal the risk corridors. “The American people are sick of Washington picking winners and losers, especially since the chosen losers often end up being taxpayers who foot the bills for Washington’s mistakes,” said Mr. Rubio. “Eliminating Obamacare’s blank check for a bailout of insurance companies is a common-sense step to protect taxpayers when Obamacare fails.”

Obamacare is already set to cost taxpayers more than $2 trillion over the next decade. Funneling federal money to insurers through 2019 to get them to play ball on the exchanges — as the administration appears to want to do — will drive that price tag even higher. Congress should put a stop to this ill-advised bailout.

The Chipotle restaurant chain 2013 annual report concludes that increasing weather volatility as well as weather pattern changes and global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of their ingredients. As the costs of basics like avocados rise, Chipotle may reluctantly choose to temporarily drop some items from their menu such as guacamole and one or more salsas. Chipotle reportedly uses 97,000 pounds of avocados per day, about 35.4 million pounds per year.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A congressional committee will meet in Fresno on Wednesday, taking up California’s drought crisis at the heart of the state’s agricultural region.

The House Natural Resources Committee will hear testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state water officials — all grappling with the drought. The hearing at Fresno’s City Hall is titled “California Water Crisis and its Impacts: The Need for Immediate and Long-Term Solutions.”

“It is my hope that we will hear more about common ground and solutions that will bring more water to this Valley instead of rehashing the tired, partisan battles over California water,” Rep. Jim Costa, a Democrat from Fresno who serves on the committee, said Tuesday in a statement.

California is in its third consecutive dry year. Gov. Jerry Brown in January declared a drought emergency, and in February President Barack Obama visited to see the crisis firsthand, delivering millions in relief aid.

Water officials said Tuesday that February delivered promising rain, but they predict having to dramatically cut back on the water that farmers receive from a pair of vast systems of canals, reservoirs and dams operated by state and federal authorities. Many Central Valley farmers say they will leave fields unplanted.

The Natural Resources Committee has 47 members. A fraction of members are expected to attend, including Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington, who chairs the committee, along with Costa and Rep. Tom McClintock.

In advance of the hearing Tuesday, several California Republicans in Congress sent a letter to Obama and Brown urging them to use their powers to help farmers and communities hit hardest by the drought. Strict regulations aimed at protecting endangered fish allowed 445,000 acre-feet of water from February rains to be lost into the ocean, the letter said.

California’s rainy season typically ends by April, said the letter signed by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who was among 13 to sign the letter.

“Given that communities in Central and Southern California are struggling to meet water needs and farmers are fallowing hundreds of thousands of acres of land that feed our state and country,” the letter said, “loss of this water is absolutely unacceptable.”

North Carolina's unemployment rate continued improving in January to near the national average, falling to 6.7 percent, the state Commerce Department reported Monday.



The report was the latest to contain mixed messages about how well the state's economy was shaping up for workers and why. While the report found the number of people employed increased by 17,407 between December and January, another survey found nonfarm payrolls recorded 7,200 fewer jobs.



"We've been in this kind of transitional period for years now. There are times when I say I wish I could have some news that was all good or all bad. If it was all good or all bad, it would be easy to interpret," said Andrew Brod, a senior researcher at the business school at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. "You take the numbers as a whole. They're not all good or all bad."



The state's jobless rate of 6.7 percent in January, down from 6.9 percent in December, was almost on par with the national average of 6.6 percent.



The state rate ranked 33rd in the country in January, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Monday. That's a big improvement over the previous January, when North Carolina's unemployment rate of 9.5 percent was among the worst in the country.



The report also marks a missed goal for Gov. Pat McCrory, who said during a campaign debate weeks before his November 2012 election that he wanted North Carolina's unemployment rate to be more favorable than South Carolina after his first year in office. McCrory took office in January 2013.



"The best way to measure things is to benchmark against your competitors, and within a year I hope we're at least beating South Carolina � my gosh, we ought to be at least beating South Carolina," McCrory said during the October 2012 debate.



But South Carolina's unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent in January.



In an email, McCrory spokesman Ryan Tronovitch said: "Gov. McCrory is focused on long-term, sustainable policies that lead to job growth and we have seen a large drop in the unemployment rate through our first year because of that. South Carolina is stiff competition, and we will continue to do all that we can to get people back to work."



The release of the January data was delayed by about a month as researchers revised and updated previous information, an annual process. The results of the revision indicate that the steady drop in North Carolina's unemployment rate had less to do than previously thought with discouraged workers quitting their struggle to find jobs and no longer being counted, Brod said.



About 60,000 dropped out of the pool of people either holding jobs or looking for work in the year ending in January, while nearly 106,000 left the unemployed list, the state report said. That indicated around 60 percent of the decline in the unemployment rate was due to people ending their job searches, for whatever reason, rather than landing jobs, Brod said.



"In terms of the flight from the labor force, it's looking as though last year wasn't as bad as we previously thought," Brod said.###2633||###2634||Rhode Island had highest unemployment rate in the U.S. in January with a rate of 9.2 percent, according to the latest data from U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics.

(Journal Staff)###2635||PERTH â€” Planes and a ship scrambled yesterday to find a pallet and other debris in a remote patch of the southern Indian Ocean to determine whether the objects were from the Malaysia Airlines jet that has been missing for more than two weeks.



The pallet was spotted by a search plane Saturday, but has not been closely examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.



It was the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to run down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it disappeared over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people on board en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.



Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center, told reporters in Canberra, Australia, that the wooden pallet was spotted by a search aircraft on Saturday, and that it was surrounded by several other objects, including what appeared to be strapping belts of different colors.



A New Zealand P3 Orion military plane was then sent to find it but failed, he said.



"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," Barton said. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.



AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.



"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."



Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of yesterday night.



Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether Flight 370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared. There was no immediate response.



When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, the first thing they found was a wooden pallet. The military first reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but then said six hours later that the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.



In Australia, eight search planes departed from a military base near the southwestern city of Perth on yesterday to scour an area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) away in an extremely isolated part of the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite images, the most recent released by China on Saturday, have showed large objects floating in the area that experts want to check to see whether they came from the jet.



Air and sea searches since Thursday have not produced any results.



John Young, manager of AMSA's emergency response division, said yesterday's search was mainly relying on human eyes.



"Today is really a visual search again, and visual searches take some time. They can be difficult," he said.



Barton said while the weather was not as good at the start of the day, with sea fog and low clouds, it was clearing up later yesterday.



Despite the frustrating lack of answers, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was upbeat.



"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope â€” no more than hope, no more than hope â€” that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft," Abbott told reporters in Papua New Guinea.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had refined the search based on the latest clue from the Chinese satellite showing an object that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet). It said the object's position fell within Saturday's search area but was not sighted.



yesterday's search was been split into two areas within the same proximity, covering 59,000 square kilometers (22,800 square miles). The areas were determined by drift modeling, the AMSA said.



Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein posted a message on his Twitter account yesterday asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.



More than 300 Malaysian cycling enthusiasts rode their bikes to the Kuala Lumpur airport to remember the people aboard the jet. The cyclists decorated the bikes with small Malaysian flags and stickers that read "Pray for MH370."



The latest satellite image is another clue in the baffling search for the plane, which was carrying 153 Chinese passengers.



"China hopes that these data will be helpful for searching and rescuing efforts," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement.



After about a week of confusion, Malaysian authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



The discovery of the initial two objects by a satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to a stretch of the Indian Ocean southwest of Australia.



Two military planes from China have arrived in Perth, and AMSA said they would join the search on Monday. They join Australian, New Zealand and US aircraft. Japanese planes are also expected soon.



Because the search area is a four-hour flight from land, some of the planes can search for only about two hours before they must fly back. Others may be able to stay for up to five hours before heading back to the base.



Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.###2636||ADVERTISEMENT

MOSCOW — Russia conceded today that it may scrap plans to tap international markets for money this year as it counts the cost of the sanctions imposed in the wake of the annexation of Crimea.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country absorbed Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported the move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

The sanctions are already being felt on the streets of Russia as Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin’s entourage.

Russian shares continued to falter today, and the benchmark MICEX index was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month amid growing tensions between Russia and the West.

In comments carried by Russian news agencies, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov became the first Russian official to admit to an economic fallout from the sanctions.

Siluanov said the country may scrap plans to raise $7 billion worth of bonds this year if oil and gas revenues remain steady. Moscow “may decide to give up external borrowing,” he said.

The economic sanctions ordered on Thursday by President Barack Obama targeted 20 people, including Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be his lifelong friends, and also a major Russian bank that provides them support.

Two Russian banks, including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up today to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank’s. They can also get cash directly inside their banks’ branches.

Putin has ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. As well as denying he had an account there, he ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them.”

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked for his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by the U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Fitch warned that the sanctions could weigh on Russia’s economy as it followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.

Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive. Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status.###2637||(Adds GameStop share reaction, analyst comments, background)

March 18 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

“We know that WMT “invests in price” ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,” Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.

Having touched a daily high at 92.81 at 0:31 GMT, AUD/JPY lost 0.45% to trade at 92.06 at 9:06 GMT. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 91.35, while resistance was to be encountered at current session high, 92.81.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Russian Federation should sign an accession treaty, according to the government website, Bloomberg reported. He is expected to take a statement in front of lawmakers and regional leaders later in the day in Moscow.

European Union’s foreign ministers reached an agreement to freeze assets and impose visa travel bans on 21 Russians and Crimeans, while the United States imposed similar sanctions on seven Russian government officials and four others from Ukraine.

The preliminary results from Crimea’s referendum on March 16th revealed that 96% of voters in the Black Sea peninsula supported leaving Ukraine and joining Russia.

Meanwhile, the Aussie received brief support against its major peers earlier on Tuesday, after the Reserve Bank of Australia published the minutes from its policy meeting on March 4th, where the bank decided to leave borrowing costs unchanged at the record low level of 2.50%.

“There were further signs that low interest rates were providing support to activity,” according to the minutes. “The most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.”

“The decline in the exchange rate seen to date would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards,” as noted in the RBA minutes.

On Monday Westpac Banking Corp. revised its forecast for additional cuts in interest rates by the RBA during the year. Bill Evans, a chief economist at Westpac, projected a possible first increase in interest rates by the Australian central bank during the third quarter of 2015.###2640||Richard Bowman 2 days ago

How Can the US Midterm Election Impact the Financial Markets?

Investing.com - The euro touched session lows against the dollar on Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

EUR/USD hit lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.14% to 1.3902.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3878, Monday's low and resistance at 1.3946, Monday's high.

The euro slipped after the ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

The report indicated that the economic upswing in Germany is not at risk. The assessment of current economic conditions improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February.

Economic expectations for the euro area also deteriorated this month, the ZEW Centre said, dropping to 61.5 from 68.5 in February, compared to expectations for a decline to 67.3.

The euro was also lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.38% to 141.11.

The yen found support as caution returned to markets ahead of a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid concerns that tensions over the situation in Ukraine could escalate.

President Putin was due to address both houses of the Russian parliament later Tuesday. On Monday President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The dollar was also lower against the yen, as Monday's relief rally faded. USD/JPY touched session lows of 101.33, and was last down 0.31% to 101.43, not far from Friday's trough of 101.19.###2643||Why did this happen?

Think tank ZEW's monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The consensus forecast was for 53. The drop was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

"The Crimea crisis is weighing on expert's economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. "Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The US and European Union imposed personal sanctions yesterday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.



The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditionsrose to 51.3 points from 50 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52 but still emphasising the strength of the German economy.



The German economy, a growth engine in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8% this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.



Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January. Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.



The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts andinvestors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said.###2645||investment choice at home and abroad

If you are looking at taking a home loan, understanding the movements of interest rates is even more critical, since you would want to decide whether to take the loan at fixed rate of interest or floating. Hybrid home loan takes away this problem. Opting for a pure fixed or a pure floating loan lands you in a situation of losing out on the benefits of the other loan. Here, hybrid loans enable you to enjoy the best of both worlds. (Also read: Home loan checklist)

What are hybrid loans?

With competition increasing with each passing day, banks and financing agencies tend to innovate products that suit and attract you. Hybrid loans are loan options where you get a mix of fixed and floating types of loans, combined into one. It is a contrast to what already existed-the fixed and floating interest rate loans. In other words, hybrid loans are combination loans, which are partly fixed and partly floating. Such loans are preferable since you do not have an idea about the future of interest rates.

Is it suitable for you?

Under this scheme, banks offer you a fixed interest rate for a certain period of time like 3-5 years, while the rest of the outstanding amount would carry a floating rate of interest. Such loans are beneficial for those who cannot afford volatility in expenses in initial few years of your financial life or careers and anticipate an increase in your ability to manage volatility before the loan begins adjusting. Such loans are typically suited to those who have a shorter credit history and a smaller power to face volatility. After the third year, you will be charged slightly higher floating interest rates. However, if you get a fixed rate loan in the beginning, you would be able to manage your financial life better. Keeping interests rates low and fixed initially will help you save more for your future and changing interest rates will help you save thereafter.

The process

When you opt for such loans, your bank might ask you to sign two separate loan agreements-one for fixed rate of interest and the other for floating rate of interest. However, many banks may combine the same and use a single agreement for both the components. You must read the terms and conditions of your agreements with utmost care and your relationship manager is bound to explain to you, if you do not understand them.

Under Hybrid loans, many banks offer you the option of foreclosing the floating component if the interest rates move up, with or without any pre-payment fees. And if the interest rates move down, may foreclose the fixed part, with or without pre-payment penalty, as per banks policies. Other banks offer you facilities such as converting your fixed portion to floating if the interest rates move down and converting the floating rates into fixed, if interest rates move up. Of course you will be charged a certain amount of fees for doing so, which can more often than not, be negotiated.

Some examples of hybrid loans include State Bank of India's offer of SBI-Flexi Home Loans, HDFC's 2-in-1 Home, Part Fixed,-Part Floating loan by ICICI and Bank of Baroda's Flexi-home loans.

For example, if you opt for a loan of Rs 20 lakh and are not sure about the movement of interest rates, you have the option of choosing to take 60 percent of Rs 20 lakh as a fixed rate home loan and remaining Rs 8 lakh at a floating rate of interest. Choosing this proportion is open to you and is based on how much risk you can afford to take and depends on your understanding of the interest rate market.

Your risk appetite would be high if you go for a higher floating component in a scenario where interest rates are likely to go upwards and vice versa.

Opting for hybrid loans is a good idea for those who keep a track of changing interest rates regularly. Otherwise, they just might be more than tricky for you. Because the initial teaser rates may be loan enough to beat competition, if you do not pay in time and keep a track of movement of interest rates, your EMI or equated monthly instalment may just shot up later. These problems blow up to a large extent in times of weak economy. Individuals who expect raises and promotions to factor in the higher EMIs they would have to pay in future have tough time when hopes do not realize.

Things to note

The two very important factors that you need to consider while analyzing floating rates would be the margin and the cap that would be applicable to you. If both these numbers are fairly low, there is nothing like going out and opting for a hybrid loan now, if the fixed rate suits your current repayment ability.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Airbnb has had some pretty bad publicity lately, but investors don't seem to be freaked.

The home rental startup is in talks to raise funding that would value the company at $10 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report published today.

The round, which will likely be led by private-equity firm TPG, is estimated to raise between $400 and $500 million.

Not only would a $10 billion valuation put Airbnb at the top of a list of the most highly venture-backed companies (joining Dropbox and Chinese mobile-phone maker Xiaomi), it would also mean the San Francisco-based home sharing service is valued more highly than some of the hotel chains it competes against, including Hyatt Hotels at $8.4 billion.

Word of the new funding round comes on the heels of a recent crop of horror stories from Airbnb hosts. Last month, Rachel Bassini used the site to rent out her New York City penthouse; she returned to find the place epically trashed (the details are both grimy and well documented). And just this past weekend, Ari Teman gave his keys to a renter before promptly discovering that said renter was using his place to host an orgy (you can read Teman's full account of the ordeal in his blog post entitled "Dear AirBnB, No Thank You for the XXX Freak Fest").

Rental disaster stories like these two, along with continued pushback from regulators, has consistently plagued the company. Ultimately, both hosts were refunded for damages incurred but that didn't stop their horrifying accounts from spreading like wildfire.

It’s clearly not enough to scare away investors, however.

While Airbnb hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability, it currently has more than 600,000 listings in 160 countries. And according to the WSJ, Brian Chesky, the company's chief executive, has major plans for continued expansion; he has indicated that he would like to add more hospitality services, taking the platform beyond simply home and apartment rentals. Earlier this year, for example, Airbnb began testing a cleaning service for hosts in certain neighborhoods in San Francisco and New York.

"We are actively looking to build specific services," Mr. Chesky told the WSJ in January. "We need to offer more."

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court has handed a defeat to a coalition of retail groups that challenged as too high the Federal Reserve’s cap on how much banks can charge businesses for handling debit card transactions.

The ruling issued Friday by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a lower court’s decision in July that favored the merchants and was a setback for banks.

In the July ruling, a federal judge struck down the Fed’s cap on so-called “swipe fees,” saying the Fed didn’t have the authority to set the limit the way it did in 2011, improperly including data that made the cap too high.

The retail groups had sued the Fed over its setting the cap at an average of about 24 cents per debit-card transaction. The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.

Congress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.

The retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.

The three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.

The National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.

“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”

The Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.

The banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Hunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed, but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”

“Make no doubt about it — consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.

The American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.

The fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.

Banks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.

Banks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.

The retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.

The Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, banks had negotiated such fees with merchants. A big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop because it handles more customers. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.

In addition to the National Retail Federation, the suit against the Fed was brought by the National Association of Convenience Stores; the National Restaurant Association; the Food Marketing Institute; Boscov’s Department Store, a chain of 40 stores based in Reading, Pa.; and Miller Oil Co. of Norfolk, Va., which operates convenience stores and gas stations.

Miller Oil has said it used to pay about 16 cents per transaction in debit swipe fees.

The Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.

AlertMe###2654||Empty###2655||Health industry officials say Obamacare premiums will likely double, and in some cases triple, in certain parts of the country next year, and announcements of rate hikes could come within months, potentially adding to the pressure on Democrats going into the midterm elections.The botched rollout of the federal healthcare program, including its numerous delays and changes, is one of the chief reasons for impending hikes, officials told The Hill, as is the impact on insurers of Obamacare's new fees and regulatory restrictions."Everyone knows that the way the exchange has rolled out … is going to lead to higher costs," a senior insurance executive who requested anonymity told The Hill.Another official told The Hill, "All these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it's going to cost."But the most significant cause of rate increases, officials say, is related to the administration's erroneous projections about the number of young healthy consumers who would enroll."Demographics matter a lot because they will help determine whether the health insurance market goes into a death spiral (or requires hefty federal subsidies to keep it from doing so)," Megan McArdle writes in her column for Bloomberg View."Young healthy people, and a lot of them, are needed to keep the market stable and premiums low. As we head into the final few weeks, we have a pretty good idea of how many young healthy people there will be, and the answer is: a whole lot fewer than the healthcare wonks were expecting."The Obama administration estimated that roughly 40 percent of Obamacare's enrollees would need to be between the ages of 18 and 35 to keep Obamacare financially solvent and premiums would cover costs.As of March 1, just 25 percent of those enrolled were young people. McArdle cites figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation which indicate that if enrollment remains at that level by the end of March, costs would be 2.45 percent more than premiums. Additionally, even if youth enrollment increased to 33 percent, costs would still be greater than premiums at 1.1 percent.The Obama administration has insisted that the rate of enrollment for the young would accelerate in the final weeks, and has orchestrated a major push to sign up young people before the March 31 deadline.But McArdle points out that even in the unlikely event that "enrollment is truly massive," it still won't be enough.Insurance officials emphasized that rate hikes will vary significantly depending on the region and the carrier, but areas of the country with older, less healthy populations are likely to be affected most.The industry warnings come less than a week after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted to congressional lawmakers that rates would increase in 2015. She emphasized, however, that growth would be slower than in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported."The increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act," Sebelius said during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.One official said he believes Sebelius' comments were a "pre-emptive strike" and an attempt to "soften up the American public" to the likelihood of premium increases."My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant," Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The Hill. "That was her way of getting out in front of it."Other health industry insiders say it's too soon to assess the accuracy of Sebelius' predictions."Health premiums increase every year, so the odds are very good that they will increase next year, as well. None of that is news. The question is whether it will be a lot or a little. That depends in part on how big the insurers think the exchanges will be," David Cutler, one of Obamacare's architects, told The Hill.Jon Gruber, who also helped design the new healthcare program, said, "The bottom line is that we just don't know. Premiums were rising 7 to 10 percent a year before the law. So the question is whether we will see a continuation of that sort of single-digit increase, as Sebelius said, or whether it will be larger."The picture is expected to become clearer as insurers begin the process this spring of filing their rate proposals with state insurance commissioners.It is possible that some insurers will continue to hold rates low to remain competitive, though some initially underpriced their policies to attract customers in the first year, expecting to raise rates in the second year, according to The Hill.If the predictions of major rate increases come to fruition, the political fallout for the Democrats — who will already be under intense pressure in the midterm elections due to the troubled healthcare law — could be even more significant.Rate hikes would also likely undermine Obamacare enrollment efforts in 2015, The Hill reported.###2656||In a growing trend, traditional payment methods of dollar bills and checks are being replaced by digital currencies that can be used to pay for goods and services.

One of the leaders in this budding technology is Bitcoin, a form of electronic money created in 2009. Its currency depends on a network of computers that deal with complicated mathematical problems to form and record the details of each bitcoin transaction, according to an article by Reuters, an international news website.

Bitcoins are created by “mining,” according to the Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin miners use specialized hardware to process transactions and secure the network, which then rewards the network with a certain number of new bitcoins and money collected from a transaction fee.

James Dow, CSUN professor from the department of finance, said it is difficult to use bitcoins because the process is complicated.

“Using bitcoins requires a certain number of computer expertises, while using regular money — anybody on the street can do that,” Dow said.

Bitcoins are kept in a “digital wallet,” a type of virtual bank account permitting people to send or receive bitcoins, purchase goods or save their money, all free from the government’s control and central banks’ intervention, according to a CNN Money article about the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin’s value lies not in physical properties and central authorities, but people’s confidence and their willing to accept them as payment, according to the Bitcoin Foundation.

Several online retailers like Overstock.com and TigerDirect have already started accepting bitcoins, but its adoption is not common, according to the Reuters’ article.

Francesco Giartosio, CEO of GlassUp, smart eyeglass store that deals in bitcoins, said the main purpose of his company accepting bitcoins as an alternative payment is to test customers’ reactions.

“It is an experiment to see if it attracts interest from people who want to spend bitcoins,” Giartosio said.“I would say the experiment has failed because we have sold only one unit.”

On Feb. 25, Mt. Gox, an industry leader in bitcoin exchange, where people can purchase or sell bitcoins under different currencies, shut down its site and closed all transactions, sparking off a host of prospective investors’ anxiety and wavering their confidence in the digital currency, according to an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Mt. Gox users might have lost more than $300 million worth of bitcoins, which was the latest and biggest failure in the virtual currency.

Giartosio said the closure of a bitcoin exchange company was not an isolated incident, and it would happen again in all likelihood.

“Fortunately, our account at Mt. Gox was empty,” Giartosio said. “It would be wise for people to keep little money in bitcoins.”

Dennis Halcoussis, CSUN professor of economics, said the incident at Mt. Gox had a great impact on bitcoin customers and investors.

“Bitcoin has a problem now because people will not feel confident about its future,” Halcoussis said.

Dow said the incident illustrates that the monetary system relies on a number of different institutions to build confidence and support it.

“A new digital currency might not have those institutions to establish, which makes more speculative and risky,” Dow said.

Marin Dajak, co-founder of www.btcgate.com, an online electronics store that accepts bitcoins, said he doesn’t expect a large number of companies to suffer the same fate as Mt. Gox.

“There is a large number of scammers and hackers out there praying on businesses and users, and while this is bad in the end, it will help strengthen the bitcoin economy,” Dajak said. “I believe the incident of Mt. Gox is a good thing, and it will help bring forward a better, more transparent exchange like Bitstamp.”

Dajak added that the main problem with Mt.Gox was poor customer support and lack of transparency and security.

“While Mt.Gox was extremely important in the beginning phases of bitcoins, it simply did not keep up with its potential and grew too big and too fast,” Dajak said.

Claudio Levrini, manager of Bitroad, a bitcoin exchange company selling electronics, said while bitcoin exchange companies take advantages of the digital currency, it is also their duty to make wise decisions an d take security measures.

“Mt. Gox was on the brink of bankruptcy from November last year, and it was known in the community,” Levrini said. “You are responsible to keep your money safe.”

Dajak said the companies that take special precautions regarding security will survive and grow.

Nancy Virts, professor of economics at CSUN, said there are no reasons for merchants to accept bitcoins because it is a very risky investment.

“Money has no intrinsic values, not like gold and coins,” Virts said. “Money is not useful unless people are willing to accept them in payment.”

Virts pointed out that bitcoins are not accepted worldwide partly due to lack of the United States government’s support.

“The advantage of dollar bills is that the US government is willing to accept in payment for taxes, and as a result, businesses are willing to accept in payment not just in the US, but all around the world,” Virts said.

Halcoussis said a currency’s stability comes from the level of people’s confidence rather than the government.

“The dollar is relatively stable because people believe that the U.S. government is stable and the dollar will continue to have value for a long time,” Halcoussis said. “A currency doesn’t have to have a government backing it, but people have to believe it will continue to have value in the future.”

Bitcoin transactions are instant, and its users do not need to have a bank account and disclose their own personal data to third party, Levrini said.

Dajak said there are a variety of advantages of using bitcoins because they are decentralized.

“We are firm believers in bitcoin, and we use it both personally and have decided to use it on our site exclusively to help make it the future of money,” Dajak said. “An added benefit is bringing down processing costs and in turn, offering the lowest possible prices for our customers.”

Dow said the biggest advantages of bitcoins are anonymity and the avoidance of government regulation, which would make it more useful for illegal transactions.

Levrini said the future of bitcoin exchange companies will become more competitive.

“Bitcoin companies are starting to evolve, and some will grow, while others will fall,” Levrini said. “This process will hopefully create a competitive market and push many serious players to participate.”

Levrini said many people are only concerned about bitcoin itself, while the true innovation is the “blockchain” concept, which synchronizes transactions between the digital currency record transactions.

The Bitcoin network depends on the “blockchain,” an electronic ledger that keeps all confirmed transactions of a specific amount of currency from one person to another, according to a blog about bitcoins. Once these transactions spread on the bitcoin network, they will be synchronized and updated on every participant’s computer.

“We accept bitcoin because we believe that this technology will redefine ecommerce and retail payments,” Levrini said. “The blockchain is an innovation that will change many aspect of the financial world forever, and the bitcoin is just the beginning.”

Levrini added that failures are inevitable, but they will be the evolution of new technology.

“Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg, and we will see many different applications coming from this technology,” he said. “In years to come we will see how big the impact of this innovation will be and what road will the progress take.”

Giartosio said the bitcoins will evolve into other forms of digital money in the future.

“Some bigger projects will replace bitcoins if they do not make partnerships with other countries,” he said. “Like Facebook has replaced MySpace, and Android is replacing iOS.”###2657||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

Turkey in the past blocked access to YouTube, but it is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country and was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government’s reputation ahead of local elections this month.

Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings on Friday. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan’s, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets.

“I hope this implementation won’t last long,” he wrote.

Many — although not all — users trying to access the network early on Friday instead saw a notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey’s lawyers’ association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey’s main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation.

Twitter’s @policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or “SMS.” It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.” Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, said his office was merely obeying court orders. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating “personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives” and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

“Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,” he said. “We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.”

Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan’s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections.

The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

The debris in the Australian image was about 2,500 km southwest of Perth and the Chinese sighting, captured two days later, was 120 km “south by west” of that.A Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data located objects 930 km north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located. One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured on Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet).The wing of ais approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base.

Several Russian banks on Friday saw their customers barred from using Visa and MasterCard credit cards as US economic sanctions over Russia's takeover of Crimea began to dig in.

US-based Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing the credit cards of customers at Russian banks due to the economic sanctions announced in Washington, the banks said Friday.

A Visa spokesman told ITAR-TASS news agency that the move was to "in order to comply with US law" and concerned four banks: Bank Rossiya, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and InvestKapitalBank.

US President Barack Obama on Thursday said a list of Russians targeted by sanctions had been extended to include billionaire businessmen bankers believed to be close to Putin.

One bank, Bank Rossiya, was also added, described as a "crony bank" for the elite.

Americans and American businesses, such as Visa and MasterCard, are forbidden from any dealings with anyone targeted by the sanctions and any assets they might have in the United States are frozen.

Clients of the banks on Friday found themselves unable to use their credit cards to make purchases or to withdraw money from cash machines not belonging to the banks.

Bank Rossiya said in a statement that Visa and MasterCard had "without warning stopped providing its payment services to the bank's clients."

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

Putin responded Friday by defiantly vowing to open an account at Bank Rossiya and have his salary transferred there.

SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, said in a statement that it believed the blocking of its customers' credit cards was "unlawful" because the sanctions targeted not the bank but its shareholders.

- 'Tens of thousands' affected -

None of the banks affected have a major high-street presence, but Bank Rossiya is used by companies within Gazprom energy giant to pay salaries to staff, the Interfax news agency reported.

"The main focus of Bank Rossiya is corporate clients... so this will not prompt public panic," said banking analyst Mikhail Kuzmin of Investcafe.ru.

"I don't think Bank Rossiya has many funds in the US, it's mainly businesses within Russia, they are not under any threat."

Kuzmin estimated to AFP that "tens of thousands" of people were affected at all the banks.

Bank Rossiya came 15th in a ranking of Russian banks by Interfax news agency last year in terms of the size of its assets.

Russia's Central Bank said in a statement on Bank Rossiya on Friday that "the operations that come under sanctions are not having a significant impact on the financial stability of the credit organisation".

"If necessary, suitable measures will be taken to support the credit organisation and give reliable protection of the interests of its account holders and creditors," the Central Bank added.

- A 'negative' effect -

So far the economic sanctions "will not affect Russian business as a whole," said Yevgeny Nadorshin, chief economist at AFK Sistema.

"These sanctions send a signal that the US did not stop at its first round (of sanctions). But it's a long way from a serious influence on the economy," he told AFP.

"If the sanctions limit the possibility of making payments to foreign agents, that would be very serious. Most Russian companies doing business with foreign partners make payments in dollars and have American accounts."

Fitch ratings agency on Friday lowered its outlook for Russia from stable to negative, a day after Standard & Poor's did the same.

That prompted an angry response from Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, who told Russian news agencies that the outlook was lowered "on orders, not objectively."

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the introduction of sanctions undoubtedly had a "negative" effect on perceptions and could lead to Russia "halting external borrowing and cutting part of its domestic borrowing," in comments to RIA Novosti news agency.###2667||Toyota Motor Corp. will pay $1.2 billion to resolve a criminal probe into its handling of consumer complaints over safety issues, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.

Toyota admitted it misled American consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about two safety issues, each of which caused a type of unintended acceleration, the Justice Department said.

The settlement resolves a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities.

Toyota faces hundreds of lawsuits over acceleration problems that gained public attention after the deaths of a California highway patrolman and his family, which were reportedly caused by the unintended acceleration of his Toyota-made Lexus.

The faulty acceleration prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles, beginning in 2009.

Last year, Toyota received approval on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims from Toyota owners that the value of their cars dropped after the problems came to light. It is also negotiating with hundreds of customers who said they had been injured.

"Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said on Wednesday. "During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."###2668||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

The U.S. Justice Department has reached a $1 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corporation over the automaker's handling of consumer complaints tied to unintended vehicle acceleration and will announce the agreement as early as Wednesday, CNN reported.

Sources familiar with the deal told CNN that Toyota Motor Corporation was expected to avoid criminal charges.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan has been probing allegations the company misled U.S. authorities after the complaints about the unintended acceleration emerged. The acceleration issue prompted Toyota Motor Corporation to recall millions of vehicles beginning in 2009.

It undertook this measure in accordance with U.S legislation after the introduction of sanctions, Visa told Prime agency.

In response to Crimea's joining the Russian Federation, the U.S. authorities imposed sanctions on 20 Russians, as well as against bank "Russia". The new list included the main owner of this bank Yuri Kovalchuk, Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, owning SMP Bank.

Afterwards, Visa and MasterCard international payment systems stopped conducting payment transactions for customers of these two banks without any notice.

"The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions against some Russian physical entities and organizations," Visa official representative in Russia said. "Visa International Service Association must suspend access to the Visa network for such organizations to comply with the U.S. legislation."

He added that as of March 21, 2014, besides 'Russia' and SMP banks, a list of these organizations includes Sobinbank and InvestCapitalBank. The last two are included in a group of bank "Russia".

The agency does not yet have MasterCard's official comments.

Reuters

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, +2.09% TM, -0.04% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota’s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn’t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.

No exact timeline was given, but the Fed's Chairman wasn't coy when asked how long the Fed would wait until after the QE tapering ends before they start to raise interest rates. Instead of reverting to type and say generic terms, Yellen actually quantified the period to "around six months" even though she wasn't pressed to give a more specific time frame. Assuming that Fed continues to cut QE purchases by $10 Billion each in the next 5 meetings, we would reach the end of QE in October, that would mean the 1st rate hike may happen during the 2015 April meeting. If the pace of decline in QE is faster, and if Yellen's 6 months is relatively flexible we could even see a rate hike at the end of 2014 or at the start of 2015. No matter how you cut it, this new guidance is earlier than the previous estimate of mid 2015.

Hence, it is not surprising to see Stock prices tanking lower heavily following this news, as market has been heavily doped up by hyper-low interest rates and the prospect of higher borrowing costs will affect traders who are using high leverage right now - and they represent a large proportion of the market if record margin debt levels shown in US exchanges are anything to go by.

Hourly Chart

S&P 500 Hourly



However, prices did not really drop that significantly. S&P 500 only shed 0.61%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower by 0.70%, while Nasdaq 100 fell by 0.64%. This is by no means the largest decline that we've seen in recent days, and the failure of risk sensitive Nasdaq 100 to fall the greatest suggest that risk appetite hasn't really disintegrated. From a price action perspective, S&P 500 remains above the 1,850 key support, and seeing how prices rebounded quickly when 1,850 was tagged, it is clear that there are bulls seeking bargain buys which will keep prices supported for now.

That being said, the failure to climb above 1,860 resistance is worrying, and right now prices are starting to head lower once again - in line with Asian stocks that are bearish right now. This suggest that a move back towards 1,850 is possible once again, but breaking below may be difficult considering that Stochastic readings should be Oversold when 1,850 is reached. Nonetheless, the support level is not invincible and should risk off appetite spread to the European session and back to US session once again it is possible for prices to go all the way back to last week's low.

Daily Chart

S&P 500 Daily

The same could be said for Daily Chart. Uptrend is still in play, echoed by Stochastic curve that is pointing higher right now. However, Stoch levels are at a "resistance zone" between 50.0 - 60.0 and it is still possible for Stoch curve to reverse here. Hence, traders who wants to play on the rebound should wait for stronger confirmation that 1,850 has held before committing heavily.

On the fundamentals side of things, it should be noted that for all the panic that Yellen's comments caused, a shift of schedule earlier by 2 months isn't really that significant in the bigger scheme of things. The largest impact it should have is on short-term speculators. As there isn't any important news today or tomorrow, the surprise hawkish talk by Yellen is expected to play on in the next 2 days. Hence, if stock prices started to show signs of bullishness today or tomorrow, the likelihood of market shrugging off Yellen's comments will be higher and we could see even stronger recovery next week if confidence is back in play.

In a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website, CEO Mark Karpeles said the company scanned “certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins.”

But lo and behold, the company found the equivalent of $115 million!

Bitcoins are a virtual currency that only exist as lines of code, stored on anything from cloud servers to thumb drives. These so-called wallets can be hacked, or users can simply misplace them or forget their passwords.

Mt. Gox, which started as a site for trading Magic: The Gathering playing cards, was later transformed into a bitcoin exchange and was at one time the largest such online service. In late February, however, the company announced it had lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins over several months, most likely due to theft from hackers. Of the 850,000 lost bitcoins, only 100,000 were the company’s own holdings. The vast majority was virtual currency belonging to users.

Some 650,000 bitcoins remain missing. That’s the equivalent of almost $400 million, depending on what the volatile exchange rate may be. One bitcoin currently trades for $575.

A lot of people are just pleased that these companies are being weeded out

Although the thefts at Mt. Gox and several other exchanges in recent months have reinforced a negative impression of Bitcoin, people within the crypto-currency community still overwhelmingly believe in the security of digital cash.

“Any news about bitcoin companies being hacked and people’s funds being stolen is obviously terrible, but a lot of people are just pleased that these companies – the ones with out adequate security or decent management – are being weeded out,” Emily Spaven, Managing Editor at digital currency news and information site CoinDesk, told me in an email earlier this month.

“The collapse of the bad actors enables other companies to learn from their mistakes and build systems that are stronger and more secure.”

Karpeles, in particular, had gained a reputation as a feckless manager who was lax about security as head of Mt. Gox. As Wired reports, important bug fixes would sometimes languish for weeks before they were implemented. For much of the last year Karpeles was also obsessed with building a “Bitcoin Cafe” in the lobby of the company’s Tokyo office building — an expensive and time-consuming project that never launched.

Esther Tung, a Vancouver-based bitcoin consultant, recently attended a digital currency conference in Austin, Texas, and found the mood was overwhelmingly positive about the future. This despite all the bad press, which included the circus surrounding the identity of bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.

“Most people think it’s a really good thing that Mt. Gox has gone away and declared bankruptcy and shut down. They weren’t good for the market,” she said.

Tung, co-founder of Saftonhouse Consulting Group, says the huge losses at Mt. Gox have only two possible explanations: “They were either incompetent or it was an inside job.”

A rare area of agreement about the financial crisis of 2008 is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the core of the meltdown and are in urgent need of reform. On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.

The plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress. Yet neither of these assumptions, on deeper examination, seems to be true.

To satisfy those who want low-priced mortgages on terms that private markets would never endorse, the plan makes explicit the government guarantee on debt which had been implicit for Fannie and Freddie. This would lower the interest rate on high-risk loans, while obscuring the cost of the subsidy.

To placate those who worry that this in turn would leave the government stuck with mountains of dud loans, a 10% capital cushion must be provided by investors to absorb initial losses.

A fee of 0.1% would be charged on all mortgage-backed bonds, with the proceeds going to three funds, two pre-existing, that will provide subsidies for housing. An as-yet undetermined insurance charge will be levied on top. The result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, "would be a strong step forward" to fixing "our flawed housing system".

If only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie. The first objection is that the law would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with a regulator atop other entities devoted to overseeing functions such as syndicating loans or bundling the loans of small banks.

When the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first. Then they tanked--presumably because investors reached page 387 of the 442-page text and found enshrined in legislation an earlier 2012 order by the Treasury that expropriated from private investors all profits made by Fannie and Freddie.

The move is unlikely to help attract the private money needed to supply the 10% in equity underpinning bonds issued under the new plan.

Opponents of Fannie and Freddie contend that the two played a key role in the crisis by encouraging the issuance of loans with tiny down payments through a benign-sounding "affordable housing" mandate. Nothing much has changed. Under the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.

Strewn through the proposed law are words such as "affordable", "equal access" and "underserved communities", which suggest that lending decisions will be based on political rather than credit criteria. "The result", says Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, "will be risky lending for those least able to cope."

The underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups. A better approach would be to handle these goals separately and explicitly.

Instead of flowing into storm drains and washing out to sea, an oversized tank harvested the precious resource to keep her thirsty citrus trees and vegetables from shriveling up on dry days.

Across Santa Monica, backyard rain barrels and cisterns are becoming fashionable. Since 2010, the beach city has doled out 385 rebates to homeowners who direct rainwater back into their gardens as part of a broader effort to become water independent that also includes cleaning up contaminated groundwater and recycling water.

“This is kind of a no-brainer, low-hanging fruit solution for anyone,” said Miller, who three years ago installed a 205-gallon water storage container, which resembles an upright accordion.

California is gripped by historic parched conditions that have desiccated farmland, dried up reservoirs and forced rural communities to ration water. A welcome dousing late last month did little to break the arid spell.

Even before this latest drought emergency, some agencies that historically draw their water from the overtapped Colorado River and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta have taken steps to slash their dependence on water from outside sources and boost their own supplies. Past drought woes, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, have forced some communities to rethink where their water comes from, and they”re increasingly realizing local sources are insurance against future dry weather.

Santa Monica, population 92,000, has perhaps the loftiest goal: to completely wean itself off outside water by 2020. The city long depended on its groundwater wells, but supplies became polluted in the mid-1990s from underground gasoline storage tank leaks and the addition of a fuel additive.

The contamination forced Santa Monica to buy most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a giant wholesaler that provides drinking water to nearly 19 million people in six counties. Meanwhile, the city used proceeds from settlements with oil companies responsible for the pollution to purge the wells. The cleanup, completed three years ago, allows the city to tap groundwater for up to 70 percent of its water needs.

About 50 miles to the northwest, the semi-agricultural community of Camarillo receives about 60 percent of its water from the State Water Project — a maze of dams, pipes and canals that carries snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and transports it to points south — that it blends with salty groundwater sources.

The Southern California port city of Long Beach, which relies on outside water for 40 percent of its drinking water, studied the possibility of building a desalination plant, which separates salt from ocean water. But it was too expensive, and the city is now focused on increasing groundwater supplies.

A recent amendment to a court order deciding groundwater rights would allow Long Beach to pump more water. It”s in the very early stages of drawing up a multimillion-dollar plan to build miles of pipelines to move the water.

While maximizing groundwater is key to cutting down on distant imports, which can be fickle depending on the weather, it”s not an option for every community.

Groundwater is “not available everywhere and it also depends on the quality,” said Jennifer Persike, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. “You have to be careful not to overpump it.”

While Santa Monica bets on groundwater, it”s also investing in other water conservation tactics, including recycling and rain harvesting. Near the touristy Santa Monica Pier, a water recycling plant treats excess irrigation and other urban runoff that is then used to water parks, school grounds and a cemetery.

The city also collects rain. The main library has a 200,000-gallon underground cistern that captures raindrops to water the gardens. Last year, officials installed a smaller cistern that will fill toilets at a newly built library scheduled to open next month.

Since 1997, the city code requires that new construction and remodeled homes must catch the first quarter inch of rain.

During a recent downpour in late February, Miller checked on her cistern, which she bought from a hardware store and installed by rerouting the downspout. She paid $571 for the tank, which is bolted to the side of her house for earthquake safety, and the city reimbursed her $250. As rain funneled from the roof into the beige cistern, water from neighboring houses coursed down the street like a river.

Though Miller”s yard consists mostly of cactus and succulents — she”s in the process of ripping up the last patch of grass — there are orange, lemon and kumquat trees, and a small vegetable bed of green beans, sweet peas and snap peas that need water. A full tank typically can last for months, allowing Miller to tend to her water-needy trees and vegetables on rainless days.

While rainwater capture does little to affect the water table, it does reduce potable water demand.

“I don”t think it”s as dramatic as buying an electric car, but if everyone in LA did it, imagine the water savings there would be,” she said.

Santa Monica officials estimate that rain harvesting, low-flow toilets and other conservation measures save the city about $326,000 per year. If the city becomes self-sufficient by 2020 as planned mainly by tapping groundwater, it is expected to save $3 million per year.

“Every drop counts,” water resources manager Gil Borboa said.

California”s drought has caught the attention of foreign leaders. During a recent three-day swing through California, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Gov. Jerry Brown that the semi-arid country has no water troubles because it emphasizes desalination, wastewater recycling, irrigation that uses less water than traditional sprinklers and other measures.

Kevin Wattier, Long Beach Water Department general manager, said incentives are important, but there”s no substitute for educating people to stop watering sidewalks.

“People need to quit wasting water. It”s that simple,” he said.###2689||Empty###2690||The new one pound coin has been deliberately designed to look just like the old threepenny bit (Picture: AP/Treasury)

For a eurosceptic government to turn the pound coin into something that looks like a euro is, frankly, a little bit bizarre.

News of this new pound coin is far more important to ordinary people than the austerity-limited tweaks to the tax system contained in today’s Budget.

‘After 30 years’ loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin,’ declares George Osborne.

The chancellor may have succumbed to Treasury madness. It’s just a coin, not a civil servant. We must pay close attention to make sure all the old £1 coins are not given pensions.

The old circular British pound is now to be replaced by something that looks like the brainchild of a mad scientist cross-breeding a 50p and a euro. It’s a jagged two-tone affair which will be virtually impossible to roll away when you drop it on the floor in the pub. Where’s the fun in that?

Such an important decision isn’t being taken lightly. It’s actually a deliberate ploy by the Conservatives to try and appeal to Ukip-voting traditionalists. Or, as Osborne says in the press release issued by the Royal Mint:

I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit.

Personally I have no idea what the threepenny bit looks like. Nor, in all likelihood, does anyone who’s reading this on a smartphone.

But we’re not the target audience for this particular bit of politicking, are we? The Tories are desperate to win over the wrinkly vote and, as this demonstrates, are prepared to try anything to make more youthfully-challenged voters feel good.

So let’s hope, for Osborne’s sake, that the coin doesn’t get mixed up with the euro.

Tories fought to prevent Britain from having a coin like this… (Picture:: McXas/McXas)

The fuss surrounding this new design calls into question the unveiling of the London 2012 logo. That was panned for being stupid. But we all got used to it and in the end we realised how clever and cool it was.

Something tells me the designers of this new pound won’t be quite as forward-looking as those who worked on the Olympics, however.

The ‘tails’ of the coin is also up for grabs. The design for the reverse is obviously going to be critical and will be the subject of a consultation.

Perhaps if enough people asked for it we could get a cup of tea on the back of the coin? Or Big Ben? Or, dare I say it, a Star Wars light-sabre fight?

Wal-Mart announced yesterday that it will begin accepting video game trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

Wal-Mart says it wants to “shake up” the secondhand market and steal some of the increasingly dwindling market-share from competitors like GameStop.

So why trade games in at Wally-World as opposed to GameStop or Best Buy? Wal-Mart executive Mac Naughton says that traded-in games will get in-store credit that can be used on anything in the store. Including, but not limited to, bags of chips, fly threads and boogie boards, as an example.

Mr. Naughton went on to explain that the other big difference between Wal-Mart and other trade-in opportunities is that the store will “pay more than anybody else” for old games. While prices vary he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.

Here's how the program works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s namesake U.S. unit, seeking to combat slowing store traffic and reverse its fourth straight quarterly same-store sales decline, announced that will begin offering store credit for used videogames at its physical stores.

Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT , which started testing its plan to accept used games online last year, said it wants a share of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S., currently dominated by No. 1 videogame retailer GameStop Corp. /quotes/zigman/389699/delayed /quotes/nls/gme GME Other retailers, including Best Buy /quotes/zigman/219712/delayed /quotes/nls/bby BBY , also buy used videogames.

Its competitive advantage, Wal-Mart said, is that shoppers can use store credit from trade-ins to buy its wide variety of goods at both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

“We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton told reporters on a call, adding the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an “inflection point” following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year. “There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment.”

The company, which already accepts trade-ins of pre-owned tablets and smartphones, said it will refurbish the pre-owned games for resale. The trade-in program doesn’t include hardware consoles.

Wal-Mart, citing research firm NPD Group, said it’s already the No. 2 U.S. seller of new physical videogame software and hardware. It said there are almost 1 billion units of used videogames that are sitting around in customers’ homes.

While getting more of the 110 million gamers into its stores looks like a safe bet at a time when the company is seeking to increase traffic, it remains to be seen how big of an impact its entry may be. The videogame industry, faced with competition from digital games played on mobile phones and the Internet, has been in decline. According to NPD Group, total physical sales of videogame software in February saw an 11% drop.

However, the used-game business tends to be more profitable. GameStop has said it’s the largest retailer of pre-owned videogames in the world, and that its used game business — with an average price of $19 — generates higher gross margins than do new game sales, with an average price of $41.

With Wal-Mart’s entry, GameStop shares fell 5% on Tuesday in their biggest percentage decline since January. GameStop said in its most recent annual filing that its trade-in program, with about 3,100 game titles, gives it a “unique value proposition” because such purchases are generally unavailable at mass merchants, toy stores and consumer-electronics retailers.

“We see this announcement as a profitability concern more than a market share concern” for GameStop, said Stifel analyst David Schick, adding pre-owned business represented 26% of GameStop’s sales and 42% of its gross profit the last 12 months.

(NEW YORK) - Walmart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Walmart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Walmart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.

As of this morning, France has now shared satellite images with Malaysian officials that point to debris in the Indian Ocean.

The images, which have not been shared with the press, show "potential objects" located in the same area where Australia and China had also found suspected debris from the plane.

Though Malaysian officials are being tight-lipped about what exactly the satellite images show, the Associated Press was told that the images were "captured Friday and pinpointed objects about 930 kilometers (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located."

These recent developments come while searchers remain in pursuit of a wooden pallet that was spotted on Saturday, but not photographed, though it cannot be confirmed that a wooden pallet was ever on the flight. When the AP contacted Malaysia Airlines for confirmation, they still hadn't responded two days later.

(CNN) — The location where a Chinese satellite captured images of a large floating object was within Saturday’s search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but searchers did not find anything, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.

Officials will now consider the new Chinese images as it plans its search for Sunday.

Early Saturday morning, China released satellite images showing a large object floating in the southern Indian Ocean and sent ships to verify, the Malaysian transport minister said Saturday.

The object was said to be 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet).

China later said the satellite images showing the “suspected floating object” were captured four days ago, on March 18.

The floating object was said to be about 77 miles from where earlier satellite images spotted floating debris.###2697||It may not buy you much these days but is the pound in your pocket actually worth anything at all?

With an estimated £45m fake £1 coins in circulation the Royal Mint is set to introduce a new 12-sided version which it says is designed to be the "most secure in the world".

The coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about how easy it is to counterfeit the current 30-year-old design.

The Royal Mint believes 3% of existing £1 coins are fake, and that the move to update the coin will increase "public confidence" in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

So, with all these worthless coins floating around the currency system how do you know if you've got one?

Depending on the quality of the counterfeit coin they may be easy to spot. Indistinct lettering or the wrong typeface on the edge of the coin is the most obvious give away.

The Queen's head and the pattern on the reverse of the coin should both be upright when the coin is turned over.

A fake coin can also be slightly different in colour. The markings on the coin could also be 'soapy' - an industry term to describe blurred and indistinct details.

The Royal Mint has issued guidance on how to spot one of the 3% of coins that could be fake as follows:

The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.

The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.

The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.

Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.

The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.

The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.

The counterfeiting of coins is a criminal offence under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company.

The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. today and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.



Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.



The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker's disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.



"Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues ... Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress," Holder told a news conference.



Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, "we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust," said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. "In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first."



Toyota said it had "made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."



Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totaling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The French businessman, formerly managing director of Hermès, started in the role two years ago to the month, during which time the label has lost two-thirds of its market value.

Godfrey Davis, the brand's non-executive chairman and previous CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found. The company is still searching for a creative director, following the departure of Emma Hill in September 2013.

Prior to Guillon's appointment, Mulberry was recognised as one of London's most high-profile brands, resonating with fashion followers, celebrities and professional women. Its bags had widespread appeal, particularly the Alexa satchel - which caused its profits to soar - and its catwalk shows were known for their starry front rows, including Kate Moss, Michelle Williams and Lana Del Rey. Upon joining Mulberry in March 2012, Guillon raised the label's prices and streamlined its famously large-scale parties in a bid to make it a serious luxury contender. Over the past two years, the brand has lost some of its playful, quintessentially British, youthful appeal, with its direction becoming increasingly unclear.

Last season, the brand cancelled its London Fashion Week show and instead staged a presentation in which Cara Delevingne unveiled a collection of self-designed bags - a move that, although it distracted the press, did not negate the company's need to find a new creative director.

The company, in its sixth year of operation, allows people to rent out their homes, apartments, rooms or even couches with Airbnb responsible for collecting the “rent” determined by the host and taking its fees. Presently, the company has over 600,000 listings worldwide. While the company has always remained mum on revenue and profitability, in December it announced that it had facilitated 10 million guest stays with over half of that number occurring in 2013 alone.

The service has received millions of glowing reports from both renters and guests alike, but when you are responsible of 10 million guest stays there will always be exceptions. Regulators have also focused on Airbnb with concerns and investigations of safety, oversight, and tax collection.

Airbnb: Trouble in rental paradise

Airbnb has recently received quite a bit of bad press with renters finding their homes trashed with used condoms and feces and, on one occasion, having their things thrown out on the street to accommodate a planned sex party.

After complaints from hotel owners, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the company to discern whether or not a number of renters were violating a state statute that prohibits sublets of less than a month when not in the property themselves. Airbnb, rather than turning over the information, is fighting the order in court.

Despite this highly-publicized exception, both Airbnb and Uber are championing the “sharing” economy where users are able to offer a ride, a room, etc. for a fee that they set with the companies taking their cut.

The last round of funding for Airbnb was done in 2012 with a valuation of $2.5 billion. In the two years since, the company has added 160 countries to its rental service, many of which have far less regulations than the United States, and as a result has seen its valuation soar. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital have all invested in Airbnb in past rounds.

In addition to its rental fees, Airbnb is actively pursuing additional revenue streams including its own cleaning service for renters in San Francisco and New York.

Enrollees in the federal exchange and most of the 15 state exchanges are not asked if they had insurance before signing up, CNBC reports.

“All applicants who are seeking subsidies must answer questions about future access to insurance, but they are not asked about prior or current coverage,” the network reports on its website.

CNBC surveyed the state exchanges and 12 of the 15 replied. Of those, only Kentucky and New York ask applicants if they previously had insurance.

Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it should have been obvious that whether those signing up are uninsured would be a common question.

"A lot of people could have anticipated this is a question everyone would be asking," she said. But it’s still understandable that the information isn’t being collected as program administrators single focus is on signing people up before the March 31 enrollment deadline, not conducting research or an evaluation, she told the network.



###2703||NEW YORK (MainStreet)  Colorado's new open market for marijuana for anyone of legal age, has decidedly changed the balance of a previously hypothetical question: what would happen to the economy, crime statistics, tax base and even employment if the plant were regulated, legally sold and taxed?

Sales figures from Colorado in the first month of legal sales alone, show that financial impact will probably make the marijuana market compete if not dwarf the amount spent on alcohol by Colorado consumers in its first year out of the gate. Approximately 37 marijuana stores across the state of Colorado estimated close to $5 million in sales during their first week in business. The 30 day figures saw a whopping $14 million in profit from the same and generated $2 million in tax revenue. Sales have been so brisk, they are now on track to reach as much as $1 billion by the end of this year just in Colorado alone.

What this will mean for bank regulation is an issue now of concern if not ongoing discussions by the federal Justice Department with financial establishments in both Colorado and Washington state, expected to follow Colorado's lead in legalizing recreational marijuana sales later in the summer of 2014.

The business climate, although flying high at the moment, still has much ground to cover even as the marijuana space gains strength in motion and organizes itself along the lines of a traditional business lobby and presence.

The uncertain legal environment, if not novelty of legal sales, however, has predictably had an impact on the first joyous days of the green rush, although prices are also widely expected to drop, if not potentially the high sales tax levy on the same. The tax structure will remain in place, however, according to state legislators instrumental in crafting them, until there is a better understanding of the market.###2704||Not on twitter?

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Airbnb has had some pretty bad publicity lately, but investors don't seem to be freaked.

The home rental startup is in talks to raise funding that would value the company at $10 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report published today.

The round, which will likely be led by private-equity firm TPG, is estimated to raise between $400 and $500 million.

Not only would a $10 billion valuation put Airbnb at the top of a list of the most highly venture-backed companies (joining Dropbox and Chinese mobile-phone maker Xiaomi), it would also mean the San Francisco-based home sharing service is valued more highly than some of the hotel chains it competes against, including Hyatt Hotels at $8.4 billion.

Word of the new funding round comes on the heels of a recent crop of horror stories from Airbnb hosts. Last month, Rachel Bassini used the site to rent out her New York City penthouse; she returned to find the place epically trashed (the details are both grimy and well documented). And just this past weekend, Ari Teman gave his keys to a renter before promptly discovering that said renter was using his place to host an orgy (you can read Teman's full account of the ordeal in his blog post entitled "Dear AirBnB, No Thank You for the XXX Freak Fest").

Rental disaster stories like these two, along with continued pushback from regulators, has consistently plagued the company. Ultimately, both hosts were refunded for damages incurred but that didn't stop their horrifying accounts from spreading like wildfire.

It’s clearly not enough to scare away investors, however.

While Airbnb hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability, it currently has more than 600,000 listings in 160 countries. And according to the WSJ, Brian Chesky, the company's chief executive, has major plans for continued expansion; he has indicated that he would like to add more hospitality services, taking the platform beyond simply home and apartment rentals. Earlier this year, for example, Airbnb began testing a cleaning service for hosts in certain neighborhoods in San Francisco and New York.

"We are actively looking to build specific services," Mr. Chesky told the WSJ in January. "We need to offer more."

The Indiana’s unemployment rate remains below all neighboring states and is now lower than the national rate by 0.2 percent, DWD added. “Prior to the benchmarking process, the last time Indiana's rate was lower than the national rate was June of 2012.”

Even so, despite a gain of 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector, Indiana shed a total of 7,100 private sector jobs in January, “mainly due to the extreme nature of the winter season, which has been cited by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the chief causes of employment contraction throughout the country,” DWD said.

“There are many positives to note this month,” DWD Commissioner Scott Sanders said. “Indiana's unemployment rate is not only lower than our neighboring states, but the national rate as well. In addition, 2,700 Hoosiers returned to the labor force and fewer were unemployed in January than at any time since August of 2008, causing our rate to fall almost one-half of a percentage point in one month.”

Sanders also noted that Indiana's 2013 total private-sector job growth number was revised upward by 8,200 jobs to 50,800 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and that despite the extreme winter weather, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were nearly 6,000 below January 2013 levels.

Sectors showing gains in January included manufacturing (+4,600); financial activities (+1,400); and professional and business services (+200).

Sectors showing decline in January included trade, transportation and utilities (-4,900); construction (-4,300); private educational and health services (-2,100); and leisure and hospitality (-600).

Total non-farm employment decreased in January by 10,000 jobs.

Regionally, Locally

In Porter County the seasonally unadjusted jobless in January rate rose to 7.1 percent, from 6.9 percent in December (9.3 percent in January 2013). Throughout the county 5,896 people were looking for work in January, an increase of 3.4 percent over December (a decrease of 22.8 percent since January 2013).

In Lake County the unemployment rate in January rose by nearly half a point, to 8.8 percent from 8.4 percent in December (11.3 percent in January 2013).

Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That's a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won't kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group.Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin's personal banker.And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned too. Foreigners probably won't do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations, and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes, and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPOs have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits like Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries.And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia's finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.And then there's Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S., and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It's a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia's stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.Of course, there other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign, and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G-8 is another good idea.But make no mistake about it, deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.That's how difficult this job is going to be.To find out more about Lawrence Kudlow and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate web page at www.creators.com.###2711||Kolin Burges, a Mt. Gox customer, protests outside the headquarters of Mt. Gox and its parent company, Tibanne Co., in Tokyo, Feb. 25, 2014. Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins still remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

Bruno Guillon quit as chief executive of Mulberry today, less than two months after the British luxury fashion company issued a profit warning that had piled the pressure on the Frenchman and his new strategy of hiking prices.

In a very brief statement, the maker of Bayswater and Alexa handbags said Guillon had advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect. He had been CEO for just over two years.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Under Guillon, Mulberry had hiked prices to take its brand more upmarket from a traditional position of "affordable luxury", and embarked on a drive to increase the company's profile overseas, targeting affluent Asian shoppers with new stores in key tourist spots.

But the group was forced to downgrade its profit forecasts at the end of January for the third time in around 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting in its main British market over Christmas hit sales.

The announcement sent its shares plunging over 25pc at the time and they have still not recovered.

"(Guillon) has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales," Davis said. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

French satellite pictures handed to Malaysian authorities on Sunday show possible debris from the missing Boeing 777, photographed in broadly the same area as objects picked up by Australian and Chinese satellites last week.

A plane scouring the search area, about 2,500km south-west of Perth, spotted a wooden pallet and other objects late on Saturday (UK time), including what looked like variously coloured straps or belts.

However, it was unable to get up close or take photographs, and other aircraft dispatched to the site on Sunday could only see seaweed.

Nonetheless, the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, expressed cautious optimism about a possible breakthrough in the 16-day hunt for the plane, which vanished off civilian radar screens with 239 passengers and crew during a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope - no more than hope - that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft," he said.

An Australian aviation expert, Neil Hansford, said he believed there was a "high likelihood" that the satellite photographs show wreckage from the plane.

A Malaysian statement about the French images gave no details about the number, size or precise whereabouts of the objects, merely describing them - in a reference to one of two broad arcs identified as the plane's likely final location - as "potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor".

The photos have been relayed to Australia, which is co-ordinating the search which began last Thursday deep in the southern Indian Ocean, after the first grainy images emerged of objects floating in the churning waters.

One large object, photographed by Australian and Chinese satellites, could be an aircraft wing - or a lost shipping container.

Mike Barton, from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said wooden pallets were commonly used in the airline industry, "usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft". Pallets were, however, also used in shipping, he noted. The agency has requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines.

The eight aircraft searching on Sunday - which included two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76s and two Japanese P2 Orions - focused on two areas covering 59,000 square kilometres.

A marker buoy was dropped at the site where the pallet was spotted so that its movement could be tracked. The air search is being supported by several ships in the area.

Mr Abbott said of the hunt: "We owe it to the almost 240 people on board the plane. We owe it to their grieving families. We owe it to the governments of the countries concerned to do everything we can to discover as much as we can about the fate of MH370."

Relatives are now enduring a third, agonising week of waiting for news.

Wang Zheng, whose parents, Wang Linshi and Xiong Yunming, were among 153 Chinese passengers, told Associated Press in Beijing: "Biggest of all is the emotional turmoil I've been going through. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I've been dreaming of my parents every day."

Mr Wang, whose parents were among a group of Chinese artists touring Malaysia, last spoke with them on the night of their departure, shortly before they boarded the plane. They were filling out exit cards at the airport, and told him they would call him on their arrival in Beijing.

Like other relatives, he is praying that the possible debris turns out to be a false lead - meaning that his parents could still be alive.

"I will stay here until they give me an answer," he said, speaking at a Beijing hotel where families attend daily briefings. "I am not leaving until I know for certain where my parents are."

The search will resume again tomorrow, but the threat of bad weather still looms, with a cyclone reported to be heading towards the search area at the moment, which will cause difficult conditions with strong winds, though it is expected to lose its strength over the next few days.

Today the Telegraph reported the investigation into how the plane carrying 239 people on 8 March went missing is becoming increasingly centred on the two pilots, following an extensive analysis of data from the plane.

According to senior sources involved in the investigation, the paper reports that authorities remain certain the disappearance of flight MH370 was a result of a "deliberate act" by a "person or persons on board".

Malaysian police have denied reports in the Mail Online that the missing flight's Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah received a two minute phone call from a woman before take-off.

The woman is supposed to have bought a pay-as-you-go phone to make the call with fake ID and the paper claims the discovery raises fears of a possible link between the Captain and terrorist groups who use untraceable SIM cards.

Assistant commissioner Datin Asmawati has called the claims "mere speculations."

He said: "Please be advised that the Royal Malaysia Police take no responsibility over the dissemination of such information which originates from unnamed and unverified sources."

"Secondly the IGP has never issued any public statement that categorically places the MH370 investigation under any act of terrorism," he added.

AMSA said it had refined the search based on the latest clue from the Chinese satellite showing an object that appeared to be 72 feet by 43 feet, when it started its mission today. It said the object's position also fell within yesterday's search area but it had not been sighted.

Yesterday's search was split into two areas within the same proximity covering 22,800 square miles. These areas have been determined by drift modelling, the AMSA said.

Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein put a message on his Twitter account asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.###2715||Empty###2716||China Unicom, one of China's three telecom giants, has joined the 4G parade.

Investing.com - The euro touched session lows against the dollar on Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

EUR/USD hit lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.14% to 1.3902.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3878, Monday's low and resistance at 1.3946, Monday's high.

The euro slipped after the ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

The report indicated that the economic upswing in Germany is not at risk. The assessment of current economic conditions improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February.

Economic expectations for the euro area also deteriorated this month, the ZEW Centre said, dropping to 61.5 from 68.5 in February, compared to expectations for a decline to 67.3.

The euro was also lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.38% to 141.11.

The yen found support as caution returned to markets ahead of a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid concerns that tensions over the situation in Ukraine could escalate.

President Putin was due to address both houses of the Russian parliament later Tuesday. On Monday President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The dollar was also lower against the yen, as Monday's relief rally faded. USD/JPY touched session lows of 101.33, and was last down 0.31% to 101.43, not far from Friday's trough of 101.19.###2718||1 of 6 View Caption

All other banking operations, including deposit withdrawals and bank payments, proceed as usual, the bank said in a statement, adding that its correspondent accounts abroad were functioning as per normal and the bank had not been informed about any interruptions in its lines of credit.

The United States on Thursday expanded its sanctions against Russia, and SMP Bank co-owners Arkadiy and Boris Rotenbergs were also hit by the sanctions.

SMP Bank holds a controlling interest in Latvia's SMP Bank, where both Rotenbergs are members of the council.

However, bankcards issued by the Latvian branch of SMP Bank are not affected by the U.S. move, SMP Bank board member Maija Treija said.

The Latvian SMP Bank is an independent bank that operates pursuant to the rules and regulations of the European Union, and it is not a branch of Russia's SMP Bank. Therefore, the decision by Visa and MasterCard to block the operations with bank cards issued by Russia's SMP Bank have no effect on the Latvian bank, stressed Treija.

SMP Bank honors all obligations to its customers, said Treija.

In a statement, Symantec said Bennett has also resigned from the board of directors. Brown joined Symantec's board after the merger with Veritas Software in July 2005. Brown had been CEO of Quantum.

The company noted that it will begin a search for a new CEO immediately. Symantec Chairman Daniel Schulman said the decision to swap out Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Nevertheless, Bennett was well along with Symantec's restructuring and refocusing. Symantec said that it still plans to meet its 5 percent annual growth revenue growth target by fiscal 2017 with non-GAAP operating margins topping 30 percent.

While it's unclear why Bennett was terminated, Symantec indicated that its guidance for the fourth quarter remained unchanged. Symantec sees fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents a share to 42 cents a share on revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion, down from $1.75 billion a year ago.

Earlier this month, Symantec named Thomas Seifert chief financial officer. Seifert had been CFO at Brightstar and Advanced Micro Devices.

Previously:###2724||Florida did a much better job of creating jobs last year than previously reported, but couldn't keep that momentum going into 2014.

The state added nearly 200,000 jobs last year, or about 35,600 more than it had estimated, according to revised figures released Monday. That's a 2.6 percent increase year-over-year, the fastest pace since the end of the recession in 2009.

January was another story.

Florida lost 2,600 jobs that month, led by a shrunken workforce in retail, hotels, restaurants, health care and government. Other than professional and business services, most industries were either flat or down.

The reversal came even as the state's unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping from 6.3 percent in December to 6.1 percent in January. The unemployment rate and the number of jobs created don't always move in lockstep, in part because they're drawn from two different surveys.

Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, said January's slippage shows just how far Florida has to go to reach full recovery.

"It's not a pretty picture," Brown said. "You do have to take the numbers with a grain of salt, but in general they're a little disappointing for the start of the year."

Economist Sean Snaith of the University of Central Florida agreed January was a setback but maintained that the upward jobs revision for 2013 was more important.

"We added an average of 3,000 more jobs a month in 2013 than we thought we had," he said. "By and large, I'd say it's a favorable report. It may be a harbinger of even better times ahead for Florida's labor market."

January was a rough month for Tampa Bay in particular. The area lost 14,100 jobs and its unemployment rate rocketed back up to 6.5 percent from an adjusted 6 percent in December. The region, which had been a statewide leader in job creation, has slipped to third biggest job-creator year-over-year behind Orlando and Miami. Compared to a year ago, the bay area is still up 29,400 jobs.

Unlike state data, metro area figures are less reliable as a gauge of economic health because they are not adjusted for seasonal hiring in industries like tourism and agriculture. As a result they tend to fluctuate more month to month.

Like Florida, the national jobless rate fell in January from 6.7 percent to 6.6 percent — and then ticked back up to 6.7 percent in February. (Florida releases its February data March 28.)

However, economists have repeatedly said the huge monthly drops in unemployment both nationally and statewide are likely overstated because of a simultaneous decline in labor force participation. People who are discouraged and at least temporarily give up their job search are no longer part of the labor pool and, therefore, not counted in the unemployment rate.

One sign of concern: Florida's 16-and-up population grew by 170,000 since January 2013, but its labor force only grew by 29,000 over the same period. Retirees account for a significant part of the labor pool slack, but not all of it.

Ironically, if job growth picks up as some economists expect, it may drive more discouraged workers back into the labor pool to compete for jobs. That could make the unemployment rate rise again, but it would still be a favorable sign of "a deepening labor market recovery," Snaith said.

Gov. Rick Scott, who was in Orlando on Monday morning, announced the new jobless rate through a brief YouTube video. In the clip, he touted that unemployment had fallen to its lowest level since June 2008. But Scott made no mention of last month's retraction in jobs.

In a separate news release, Scott's office focused on long-term positives:

• Since December 2010, Florida has created 503,500 private sector jobs.

• Over the same three-year stretch, unemployment has fallen 5 percentage points.

• The annual "benchmarking" revision to adjust the data and tie it to tax records showed the state added 40,700 more private sector jobs over three years on top of the original estimate of 462,100 jobs.

"We have come a long way in three years, but let's keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one," Scott said in a statement.

Mekael Teshome, an economist with PNC Financial Services Group, said he doesn't think the weaker-than-expected January report will sidetrack Florida. He still predicts the state will see balanced growth in 2014 and continue to outperform the rest of the country.

The lower labor force participation is a risk, Teshome said, "but I don't see the economy itself being at risk. The major aspects of the economy are improving … 2014, I think, should be better than 2013."

Copyright NBC Owned Television Stations###2730||Did Wal-Mart just put GameStop out of business? That's the question buzzing around Tuesday morning on the heels of news that the superstore chain is re-starting its video game trade-in program, a move that positions the retailer to take a huge bite out of GameStop's core business strategy. As a result of the speculation, shares of GameStop are down about 6% in early morning trading.

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday morning that starting March 26, customers will be able to trade in their old video games in exchange for gift cards that can be used towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, in stores or online. Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide and accepting games used on consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360, the move marks a direct threat to GameStop, whose 6,488 stores do significant business in the pre-owned video game category. In its third fiscal quarter in January, GameStop said it saw pre-owned sales increase 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, or 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also said in January that gross margins for the pre-owned category are expected to range from 46% to 49% for both its fourth quarter and its full fiscal year.

Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S, acknowledged that the company is "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," saying that gaming is important category to Wal-Mart. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,” Mac Naughton said in a statement Tuesday morning.

It's worth noting that this is Wal-Mart's second attempt at entering the pre-owned video game market; in 2009, the superstore chain introduced kiosks that customers could use to trade in their old video games, but the program failed to work and was suspended in 2010. More recently the retailer was quietly accepting trade-ins online, but in partnering with CE Exchange, the company behind Wal-Mart's tablet and smartphone trade-in program, Wal-Mart is clearly hoping this newest attempt at capturing the pre-owned video game market will be more successful.

It remains to be seen if Wal-Mart's new program is appealing to hard-core gamers, who often trade in old games just to buy new ones -- and not things like clothes or sports equipment or other Wal-Mart products. If enough video game customers aren't interested in Walmart or Sam's Club dollars, GameStop could very well emerge from this test unscathed.

Following Wal-Mart's announcement, shares of GameStop initially sank more than 7% in Tuesday's pre-market trading session; the stock is currently down about 6.3%. Year-to-date, the video game retailer has trailed the market, posting a near-20% decline for 2014 thus far. It finished 2013 trading with a 92% return. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, was relatively unmoved in Tuesday's pre-market trading: the stock is currently down just .08%. Year-to-date, the superstore is down 5.4%.###2731||Empty###2732||Empty###2733||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

Last month CEO Mark Karpeles reported 850,000 Bitcoins missing, where Bitcoins were mysteriously moved to online wallets and then to offline wallets where they disappeared, but some has been found. Mt. Gox revealed today that they found an old online wallet that hadn't been used since 2011 and still had some change in it. The company announced in Japan that it found 200,000 Bitcoins in said wallet, which is worth just over $115 million at this morning's exchange rate.

There's still a ton missing and a lot of people lost money on the now-closed company, but it's something.

Of course, no one knows exactly what happened to all that money- was it straight theft? Why did the company keep trading long after it had knowledge of the theft? Was it outside forces or someone within?

Whatever the case stories like this don't help the new currency's reputation, especially when compounded of stories about suicides, a mysterious creator who may or may not have been finally revealed, and a rapidly fluctuating exchange rate. Still, Bitcoin remains popular, as does Bitcin mining, the process by which new Bitcoins are created by utilizing your computer's power.

It did fall under $600 for the first time yesterday, but it's been pretty stable around $600 for months. We'll see if the price drops any further- you can bet the thousands of people with money on the line will be doing so as well.###2735||Empty###2736||Empty###2737||Empty###2738||New £1 coin designed to beat fakers BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/new-1-coin-designed-to-beat-fakers-30105200.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article30105199.ece/87352/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-7df2b86b-7fa2-4c1f-a17a-049bb6360bd0_I1.jpg

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: " After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: " The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."###2739||NEW YORK | Walmart Stores Inc. is hoping to shake off the winter sales doldrums with its biggest spring sales push ever.

The world's largest retailer is discounting more than 60 outdoor essentials from lawn mowers to mulch by 30 percent to 50 percent in a push that aims to take business from competitors like Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos.

The sale starts Friday and will run through March 29. Items include a seven piece-Mainstays patio furniture set for $298, $15 stacking sling chairs, $88 Kingsford charcoal grills and $144 lawnmowers from brands like Murray and Snapper.

Shoppers also can find five bags of Miracle-Gro garden soil for $10 and bags of mulch for $1.97 each. The event will be advertised in a 12-page Sunday circular.

Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said the sale was planned last summer as executives received forecasts that the winter was going to be especially harsh. But the company made changes since then because the winter was even more severe than expected.

Walmart is counting on an extra boost in sales from items like garden soil as shoppers prepare to restore their gardens and outdoor living spaces hurt by a series of winter storms.

Walmart and other retailers have seen their sales chilled by storms that caused them to close hundreds of stores and kept shoppers at home. The discounter said in February that during the height of winter storms, it had more than 200 stores closed.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Michelle Gloeckler, Walmart's senior vice president of home, described the sales event as offering Black Friday-like prices.

"I love the fact that we had a rough winter because people are going to be so ready," she said. She noted that Walmart dramatically increased the quantities of items such as mulch and other outdoor products, in anticipation of increased customer demand. She declined to offer figures.

Walmart's lawn and garden offerings, including plants, also are tailored to the climates of each region. For example, customers in southern markets such as Dallas and Atlanta will find warmer-season plants including petunias and marigolds. Shoppers in northern markets like Chicago and New York will find cold-tolerant varieties such as pansies and snapdragons.###2740||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

The move came Thursday almost two months after the company reported revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 27 had dropped five per cent year-over-year.

Bennett had held the post since July, 2012.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” board chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”

But, he added, “we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than five per cent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 per cent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

The news caught the industry by surprise.

One financial analyst quoted in SiliconValley.com called it a shocker. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out,” Daniel Ives of FBR Capital markets said. “They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”

Symantec CEO talks up reorganization

In an interview this morning Gartner’s lead Symantec analyst Gene Ruth also said he was surprised at the news. In November the market research company published a positive rating on Symantec, saying things were improving at the company and that customers should continue to look at them for enterprise products. As recently as last month he spoke to Symantec officials and came away with “a good feeling.”

Ruth said he has talked to Bennett a number of times, and found his strategy of pushing Symantec to sell more solutions the right one. “Of course strategies are a wonderful thing,” Ruth added, but you have to implement them.”

Then after the firing announcement was made he spoke Thursday to chief operating officer Stephen Gillitt. There was no light shed on the reasons. In fact, he was struck that the strategy going forward is to stick to Bennett’s strategy, Ruth said, but do things faster.

Speed isn’t enough of a justification to abruptly dismiss a CEO, Ruth argues. It’s not like that board suddenly decided the company wasn’t moving fast enough. In fact, he adds, Bennett warned that the transition he planned could take several years. So he wonders if there were disagreements between the board and Bennett that aren’t being publicly aired.

Symantec announced the end of Steve Bennett's time as CEO with board member Michael Brown taking over as interim president and CEO immediately with the vendor kicking off the search for a full-time replacement.

Bennett had been in the role less than two years after coming in to replace another short term boss Enrique Salem, who left in 2012 after just three years in the job because he had not managed to improve the performance at the firm.

The decision to part with Bennett was described by the vendor as something that had come about after a review of the situation rather than a knee jerk reaction to the most recent set of financial results, which showed that the business was still struggling with a 5% decline in revenues for its third quarter.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said Symantec board chairman Daniel Schulman.

Under Bennett's leadership the firm underwentseveral major changes to improve its fortunes, including making revisions to its partner programmes, making changes to the sales team, splitting into renewals and new business and changing the direct sales outfit to focus on information management or security.

The firm followed that up by taking the wraps off a global channel strategy last November that was based around reseller competencies rewarding those that delivered value to customers by developing their skills.

Schulman said that Bennett had made some positive changes to the way the vendor operated, improving efficiencies and reducing costs but it had to bring on board someone who could improve its fortunes.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth," he said.###2744||Empty###2745||China highly concerned about possible Australia MH370 find

Beijing (ANTARA News/Xinhua-OANA) - China paid great attention to Australias possible findings related to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Thursday.



Two objects possibly related to flight MH370 have been sighted by satellite in the remote southern Indian Ocean, Australian officials said Thursday.



Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that "new and credible information" based on satellite imagery had come to light, and that four long-range surveillance planes were being diverted to look into the find in the southern Indian Ocean.



China expects the Australian side to send vessels and airplanes as soon as possible to related waters for search and verification, said Hong.



He said the Chinese Foreign Ministry has ordered the embassy and consulates in Australia to keep in close touch with the Australian authorities and assist the Australian side in the searching and rescuing work.



The Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, mysteriously disappeared in the early hours of March 8. A total of 239 people were on board, including 154 Chinese passengers.

The increase, which contrasted to the 9.5 percent decline in 2012, was mainly attributed to the company's 3G business. The number of 3G mobile subscribers surged 49.3 percent to 103 million by the end of last year.

The company's revenue totaled 321.58 billion yuan, up 13.6 percent year on year, with revenue excluding mobile phone sales at 284.15 billion yuan, up 10 percent from the previous year.

The number of mobile subscribers reached 186 million, up 15.5 percent year on year, said the report.

China Telecom is the nation's largest fixed-line service, and the third largest mobile telecommunications provider in terms of subscriber number after China Mobile and China Unicom.

Bruno Guillon quit as chief executive of Mulberry today, less than two months after the British luxury fashion company issued a profit warning that had piled the pressure on the Frenchman and his new strategy of hiking prices.

In a very brief statement, the maker of Bayswater and Alexa handbags said Guillon had advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect. He had been CEO for just over two years.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Under Guillon, Mulberry had hiked prices to take its brand more upmarket from a traditional position of "affordable luxury", and embarked on a drive to increase the company's profile overseas, targeting affluent Asian shoppers with new stores in key tourist spots.

But the group was forced to downgrade its profit forecasts at the end of January for the third time in around 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting in its main British market over Christmas hit sales.

The announcement sent its shares plunging over 25pc at the time and they have still not recovered.

"(Guillon) has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales," Davis said. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

* U.S. Feb CPI up 0.1 pct, matches consensus estimate

* Yuan down against dollar and yen

* Yen benefits broadly, helped by Ukraine worries

By Daniel Bases

NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - A modest easing of geopolitical tension in Ukraine and a slight increase in U.S. Treasury yields took some premium away from the euro on Tuesday, sending it down against the U.S. dollar and the yen.

The Chinese yuan deepened its month of losses against the greenback on more signs of problems with a slowing economy and a heavily indebted corporate sector. The yuan’s weakness was seen as a benefit for the yen, helping lift it against the greenback.

Market strategists pointed to comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine as a signal the crisis may not deepen. Putin signed a treaty on Tuesday making Crimea part of Russia, defying Ukrainian protests and Western sanctions.

“Right now I am more inclined to treat this as intra-day noise,” said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. “As much as I do think geopolitics should be a bigger euro negative and bigger negative on Europe as exposures to Russia and Ukraine are much bigger, I don’t think the market is focusing on that. I think the market is focusing on the lack of escalation in the tensions.”

“I think the Crimea was a foregone conclusion and we have known that at least since the weekend. But I think the sanctions now are more rigorous or harder now than the sanctions that were put on Russia after they went into Georgia in 2008,” Chandler said.

The euro dipped 0.11 percent to $1.3904, having briefly broken down to $1.3891, but it essentially remained in a narrow trading range with a high on the day of $1.3941.

The crisis in Ukraine led to a sharp drop in Germany’s ZEW survey of investor and analyst sentiment, contributing to early losses for the euro.

The dollar fell to 101.51 yen, a loss of 0.25 percent against the Japanese currency.

There was little impact on markets from U.S. consumer inflation data, which showed a slight rise of 0.1 percent, a muted increase despite rising food prices.

“We see a significant risk off which is fading, linked to Ukraine, then we still have the worry of China, but it is not leading to contagion. It is receding,” said Sebastian Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York.

YUAN DROP

Reversing one of the past decade’s few sure bets in the foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan is down around 2.5 percent in the past month. That move has resumed since officials widened the trading band for the currency over the weekend.

A survey of 970 global investors by Barclays showed that China’s problems have replaced the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reining in of monetary policy as the biggest concern for market players since the start of 2014.

“I’ve squared up now but I think there’s a risk that the yuan could go to 6.30-6.40 per dollar,” said Graham Davidson, a foreign exchange trader at Australian bank NAB in London.

“The yen will tend to gain against the dollar as the yuan weakens.”

The yuan weakened to 6.1795 to the dollar versus Monday’s close around 6.1580.

There are differing schools of thought on the fallout for Japan of a weaker yuan. On the one hand it allows Japan’s big manufacturers to invest more cheaply in producing cars and electronics in China, while the competitive advantage of those factories also grows. Profits can then flow back into Japan.

On the other hand, a generally weaker Chinese economy poses problems for Japan given China’s importance as a market for Japanese products and investment.

Dealers say that many of those who were betting strongly at the start of this year on further gains for the yuan are still to be shaken out, and that the currency could go much lower.

The main barrier to that is the People’s Bank of China itself, which has kept its reference rate for the yuan around 6.13 for a week, encouraging speculation it may defend the top end of its newly widened 2 percent band around 6.25 per dollar.

“If the top of the band is 6.25-6.27 they are not showing any great signs of wanting to let that go,” Davidson said.

The yuan - which is not fully convertible internationally and trades in a complicated system of “offshore” and Chinese “onshore” rates - was 0.5 percent lower against its Japanese counterpart at 16.4331.###2751||NEW YORK (AP) – Sally Beauty is reporting that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

The French businessman, formerly managing director of Hermès, started in the role two years ago to the month, during which time the label has lost two-thirds of its market value.

Godfrey Davis, the brand's non-executive chairman and previous CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found. The company is still searching for a creative director, following the departure of Emma Hill in September 2013.

Prior to Guillon's appointment, Mulberry was recognised as one of London's most high-profile brands, resonating with fashion followers, celebrities and professional women. Its bags had widespread appeal, particularly the Alexa satchel - which caused its profits to soar - and its catwalk shows were known for their starry front rows, including Kate Moss, Michelle Williams and Lana Del Rey. Upon joining Mulberry in March 2012, Guillon raised the label's prices and streamlined its famously large-scale parties in a bid to make it a serious luxury contender. Over the past two years, the brand has lost some of its playful, quintessentially British, youthful appeal, with its direction becoming increasingly unclear.

Last season, the brand cancelled its London Fashion Week show and instead staged a presentation in which Cara Delevingne unveiled a collection of self-designed bags - a move that, although it distracted the press, did not negate the company's need to find a new creative director.

The firing, which was effective immediately, came in the wake of a number of senior managers leaving the firm now facing lessening revenues even as the cyber security market continues to thrive. Board member Michael Brown will be replacing him for the meantime, the report said.

A source told FT that Symantec was worried about product strategy after the entire senior leadership in product development quit the firm, with some joining rival firms. Bennett took the helm in 2012 and in the course of his leadership, senior leaders and some important board members have departed the firm or have been removed. Symantec's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, President in Charge of Product and the President in Charge of Engineering and the Senior Vice-President of Worldwide Sales are not anymore with the company, FT reported.

The source told FT, "It is hard when an organisation goes through that much turnover, it loses institutional knowledge and hurts momentum. When you see that amount of turnover it might be an underlying problem with the leadership."

Symantec said it the removal of Bennett was not caused by any event or misbehavior and that it was just a part of the process the company was going through. Symantec shares had dropped 11% this year while that of its younger competitors have gone up significantly. For example, FireEye went up 54% while Palo Alto Networks went up 37%. After news of Bennett's termination was announced, after-market trading of shares of Symantec were halted, the report said.

Brown assured that Symantec has now put together a leadership team that would hasten their growth. FT quoted him as saying, "The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market."###2760||Print Article

In this Dec. 4, 2013, photo, Tracey Anderson, 26, re-stocks X-Box sets on opening day of a new Wal-Mart on Georgia Avenue Northwest in Washington.

NEW YORK - Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games, with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it's also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well," Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers."

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer's $55 used version.

"You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing," Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular "Gears of War" franchise, said last year###2761||Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox found $116 million worth bitcoins. The catch? These bitcoins were presumed to be lost. The find that could provide some relief to the scandal hit exchange.

Time reported the bitcoins were found in an old-format wallet, previously thought to be empty. The two hundred thousand bitcoins that were found on March 7 may help the exchange weather the crisis caused after it had "lost" 850,000 bitcoins. Following the loss, the exchange filed bankruptcy.

According to a letter dated March 20, posted on Mt Gox's website, the company decided to scan all old wallets.

"Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7 MtGox Co confirmed that an old­ format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC," it said.

"For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC were moved from online wallets between March 14 and 15 to offline wallets," the letter further stated.

The company said in the letter the total number of bitcoins originally presumed to be lost have now come down by 200,000. The exact number of coins that disappeared, though, is under investigation and the figures may change.

Financial Times pointed out Mt Gox was seeking a debt restructuring of $64 million.

Reuters said that several creditors were skeptical about the Mt Gox's explanations of how the bitcoins had vanished. It also expressed reservations over the find from a plaintiff who filed a class action against the exchange agency. The judge in Chicago overseeing the matter allowed for tracking of bitcoin exchange.

Steven L. Woodrow, one of the partners at Edelson representing the plaintiff, said, "Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it 'found' these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins."###2762||Get daily news updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

A flood of fake currency has prompted the Royal Mint to release a new "counterfeit-proof" £1 coin.

But how do you spot one?

There are estimated to be in excess of 30million fake pound coins in circulation.

It is illegal to use one and the Royal Mint says you must hand them in if you think you have been given one.

Depending on the quality of counterfeit, it can be difficult to tell the difference between a real and a fake £1 coin.

But there are a few key things to look out for:

1. The date and design on the reverse should match. It is changed each year and you can see a list of dates and designs here

* Bank’s clients include businesses owned by Gazprom

* Timchenko, also hit by U.S. sanctions, has stake in lender (Adds comments, background)

By Lidia Kelly and Oksana Kobzeva

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged support on Friday to a secretive bank long-associated with the Kremlin that was hit by U.S. sanctions and which serves clients in Russia’s energy sector, including businesses owned by Gazprom.

Bank Rossiya, and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk, were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin’s close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world’s largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, played down his association with the bank, but ordered the central bank to support the lender.

“And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand, it is a medium-sized bank,” he told a meeting of Russia’s Security Council. “I personally don’t have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday.”

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

OBSCURE BUT POWERFUL

Little has been known about Bank Rossiya, which has risen to become the country’s 15th largest bank by assets last year from 54th in just six years.

Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder in the St Petersburg-based bank is a close Putin ally. The friendship between the two dates back to the early 1990s, when Putin served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

Kovalchuk was also one of the three founding members of the Ozero (Lake) luxury dachas complex outside St Petersburg who were targeted by the U.S. sanctions

“Kovalchuk ... Timchenko ... I think I need to stay away from them,” Putin joked on Friday.

The bank’s operations are concentrated around St Petersburg and Moscow, serving chiefly clients in oil, gas and energy. The bank also controls large insurance firms Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom’s businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

“Our companies will continue using the services of the bank,” a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

According to the bank’s most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank’s corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

The bank paid 106.5 roubles ($2.94) per ordinary share in dividends on 2012 earnings for a total payout of 267.1 million roubles ($7.37 million), suggesting that Kovalchuk got $1 million in dividends for his stake.

According to a 2008 article by the business daily Vedomosti, nearly 4 percent of the bank belonged to a distant cousin of Putin, Mikhail Shelomov.

One of the bank’s clients, the state electricity holding firm InterRAO is run by Kovalchuk’s son Boris Kovalchuk.

“We have small rouble deposits and an insignificant loan burden, in both roubles and foreign currency, but settlements for the latter are made in roubles,” Anton Nazarov, a representative of InteRAO told Reuters, without disclosing the amounts.

Three of the bank’s clients, the utility holdings FSK , Moscow United Electric Grid Co. (MOESK) and the grid company Rosseti, told Reuters they hold only rouble accounts at the bank.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following Washington’s sanctions. Western Union the world’s largest money transfer company, has also suspended its services for the bank.

“The bank has a strong liquidity cushion and the imposed sanctions will not affect the company’s operations,” Bank Rossiya said in a statement late on Friday.

“Currently, there is no area (of the bank’s operation) that would require assistance from the Central Bank.”

The Russian central bank said that it stood ready to support the sanctions-hit bank. “If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors,” it said in a statement.###2769||Empty###2770||###2771||Empty###2772||Article Tools Font size – + Share This

In this March 16, 2014 satellite imagery provided by Commonwealth of Australia - Department of Defence on Thursday, March 20, 2014, a floating object is seen at sea next to the descriptor which was added by the source. Australia's government reported Thursday, March 20, 2014 that the images show suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating in an area 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth Australia. (AP Photo/Commonwealth of Australia - Department of Defence)

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia's southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia's capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."

News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.

"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.

But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don't have — the location of MH370."

Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).

Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.

"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.

The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.

Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."

Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.

Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.

Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.

Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association told The Associated Press.

"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.

The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.

Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.

The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.###2773||Watch out, GameStop, you have a new competitor in the used game market. Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to “shake up” the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

Wal-Mart’s “true differentiator,” Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can’t compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It’s credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.###2774||Empty###2775||Empty###2776||Foreign Correspondent

ISTANBUL // The decision by Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to block access to Twitter, triggered a rare public condemnation yesterday by the nation’s president, Abdullah Gul.

Mr Gul defiantly used the social-media site to criticise the restriction as unacceptable, in a development that highlighted a growing rift between two men who have shaped Turkish politics for more than a decade.

“If there have been crimes like the violation of people’s rights, only individual pages can be banned by court order,” Mr Gul said on Twitter. “I hope that this practice does not last long.”

The ban was ordered by the government’s internet agency on Thursday after what it said was a refusal by Twitter to block several tweets whose deletion had been ordered by Turkish courts. It came after Mr Erdogan said he would “rip out the roots” of the website at a campaign rally on Thursday for the March 30 municipal elections. Twitter is where leaks to recordings appeared that seemed to implicate him and other top officials in a corruption scandal, which has posed the most serious test to his 11 years in power.

The content of Mr Gul’s message – and the way it was delivered – was a message to Mr Erdogan’s religiously conservative government, observers said.

“This would certainly upset the prime minister,” said Mustafa Akyol, an author and newspaper columnist. “Disagreements are becoming harder to reconcile.”

Earlier this week, Mr Gul made the headlines by distancing himself from Mr Erdogan’s handling of a corruption scandal that has engulfed the government since last December.

Mr Erdogan has called the corruption allegations parts of a foreign plot against Turkey, but Mr Gul dismissed the prime minister’s statement as “worthy of a third world country”.

Mr Gul, 63, and Mr Erdogan, 60, both started their careers in an Islamist party later banned by the courts and are co-founders of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as well as long-time political allies.

Mr Gul served as the first AKP prime minister from late 2002 until March 2003, when he made room for Mr Erdogan and became foreign minister.

Mr Gul, who is seen as a more liberal politician than Mr Erdogan and a strong supporter of Turkey’s bid to join the European Union, was elected president in 2007 and remains highly respected within the AKP.

Analysts said Mr Gul wanted to make clear that he did not like the direction that the country was taking under Mr Erdogan.

“This is an effort to counterbalance the harm” done by the Twitter ban, Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Istanbul’s Bilgi University said. The political relationship between Mr Gul and Mr Erdogan was “slowly developing into a more open difference of opinions”.

Mr Turan said Mr Erdogan was running the risk of ruining his chances to become president in elections scheduled for August. “By his own actions, he may be disqualifying himself as a candidate”.

Some AKP ministers and members of parliament had displayed a marked “lack of spirit” in executing Mr Erdogan’s orders lately, Mr Turan said.

If the AKP was to do worse than expected in the March 30 elections, Mr Erdogan’s role as party leader could come into question, he said.

Most polls indicate the AKP, which has led the country through a massive economic boom and has pleased religiously conservative voters by ending a ban of the Islamic headscarf in state institutions, is likely to keep its position as Turkey’s strongest party with around 40 per cent of the vote in the upcoming elections.

But some polls suggest Mr Erdogan’s party could do badly in some big cities like Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.

Mr Akyol, the author, said Mr Erdogan remained popular with many conservative Turks despite the wave of protests after the Twitter ban.

“For the average Erdogan voter, the Twitter ban is not a problem,” he said.

The attempt to block to Twitter appeared to backfire with many tech-savvy users – besides Mr Gul – circumventing the ban.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors, the Associated Press reported.

The European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban – in a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.”

Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, as part of that effort, just signed a new law calling for uniform packaging of edible marijuana. In an effort to make those products less attractive or accessible to kids, they will have to be sold in opaque, childproof packaging.

State Rep. Daniel Kagan, who co-sponsored the legislative fixes, explained: "We identified these problems and we sought to tighten it up, to make sure that marijuana is really kept for adult use and kept away from under-aged persons and especially from toddlers."

Kagan added, "We do it differently in Colorado. Everybody came together on this."

Children's Hospital, based in Aurora, has weighed in on the legislative efforts -- reporting an increase in emergency room visits and patient admissions from accidental exposure.

Dr. Sam Wang, pediatric emergency physician, said symptoms range from basic sleepiness to more severe cases, where children have not been able to breathe properly and required breathing tubes. "As recreational marijuana goes forward, it's obviously going to increase availability and potentially increase unintentional exposures as well," Wang said.

Other fixes signed by the governor on Monday include giving authority to pot shops to confiscate forms of identification, if they have reason to believe someone underaged is using a fake ID. Another measure calls for local jurisdictions to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal record checks on people working in marijuana businesses.

State Sen. Linda Newell, a Democratic co-sponsor, acknowledged their work is not done. "We will probably find these clean-up bills as we go through the years after marijuana, both medical marijuana as well as recreational marijuana, has become a norm in Colorado," she said.

The issue of stoned drivers is another trouble spot for state lawmakers. At a laboratory certified to test blood samples for marijuana, the director told Fox News there is not a roadside test, such as a breathalyzer, in the foreseeable future for determining if a driver is under the influence of cannabis.

"One person may have a very high THC concentration in their blood, particularly medical marijuana users, and they're not affected. Where someone who has never smoked marijuana before, will have a much lower concentration and be very affected," said Dr. Robert Lantz, of Rocky Mountain Instrumental Laboratories.

According to state Marijuana Enforcement Division Public Information Officer Julie Postlethwait, Colorado has issued licenses to hundreds of vendors, including:

-- 183 retail stores

-- 238 retail cultivation facilities

-- 44 product manufacturers (i.e., edibles)

-- 4 testing facilities (for product potency and contaminants)

Dozens more are pending with the state in these categories. For those with state licenses in hand, they may not be open yet because they have to obtain paperwork at the local level, too.

Local permission can be thorny because Amendment 64, the state constitutional amendment which legalized recreational pot, left it up to municipalities in the Centennial State to decide whether to allow marijuana businesses within their borders.

Dale Dyke and Chastity Osborn, a husband-and-wife team who converted their home into a bed and breakfast, complained that the "laws are very gray." Their business Get High Getaways was catering to marijuana tourists until the City of Lakewood ordered them to shut down the overnight stays. One complication is that while Colorado legalized recreational pot, the state left it illegal to use the drug outside in public or in traditional hotel rooms. For now, the couple is maintaining their location as a car service while working with investors to purchase a new location.

Recently, a marijuana job fair in Denver drew thousands of people with lines stretching a few blocks long. It has been referred to in local media reports as a "green rush."

Visitors told Fox News they're moving to the state in hopes of finding jobs in the marijuana business. Shane Wylie and Matthew Bean are among them. They drove 1,300 miles from Louisiana, just in time for the fair.

"This is our life-changing experience, this is our big step and career change," Wylie explained. Bean added, "I want to start from the bottom, so I can learn everything."

NEW YORK

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called “Savings Catcher” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths such as Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit-card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it’s successful, others may follow.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then log onto the Savings Catcher page on www.walmart.com/ and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn’t include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn’t apply to general merchandise such as clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and items such as detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card, and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift-card receipt.###2785||Florida's unemployment rate dropped slightly in January, although the actual number of jobs actually shrank, according to new data released Monday.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida's unemployment rate dropped slightly in January, although the actual number of jobs actually shrank, according to new data released Monday.



The mixed results did not stop Gov. Rick Scott from touting the latest numbers as he focused on the steady recovery of the state's economy.



"It is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," Scott said in a statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow."



Scott has made the rebound in the state's economy a centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. He has noted in campaign speeches that the unemployment rate increased under former Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist, who is now a Democrat and challenging Scott, has said Florida suffered because of the economic downturn that affected most of the nation and world.



The state's unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, which was lower than it was at the end of the year. The rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.



There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.



Despite the overall rate dropping slightly by 0.2 percent, the overall number of jobs in the state dropped by 2,600. The number of jobs is calculated using a separate survey.



Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, noted the decline to jobs to blast Scott for "desperately attempting to take credit for a recovery that's more anemic than what the economy was already predicted to do on its own."



Florida overall has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida trailed Texas and California.



Scott has said the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies, including his push to cut back on regulation and lower taxes.



But economists who work for the Florida Legislature have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or delayed their job search. A state economic overview released in February concluded that if the number of people in the labor force had held steady since December 2011, the real unemployment rate would be 7.9 percent.



Monroe County in the southern end of the state had the state's lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, followed by Walton County in the Panhandle at 4.2 percent. Hendry County, in the southern interior, had the highest unemployment rate at 9.8 percent, followed by Flagler County in northeast Florida at 9.3 percent.###2786||Empty###2787||Walmart outlines new video game trade in program and used games plan

Walmart has been expanding its digital video offerings for a long time. The massive retailer operates its Vudu service and began to offer support for Intel’s UltraViolet DRM cloud video library late last year. Walmart has announced a new service for gamers that will launch this month.

Starting on March 26, Walmart will launch a new video game trade in program. Gamers will be able to bring their old and unwanted games into Walmart locations to trade the titles in and get immediate credit in the store. The store credit for the games will be usable for any purchase in the entire store.

That means you can trade in your old games and use the credit for food, clothing, gadgets, automotive service, or whatever floats your boat. The credit will also be usable at Sam’s Club locations as well. The trade-in program works like most others where the user can bring games in the original packaging to the electronics department.

The game will be inspected for damage and then the user will get a trade in value on the game. The credit is then given immediately and can be applied to purchases at checkout. The trade in program will be offered at 3100 stores across the nation. There is no indication of what the trade-in value on games will be. Walmart will also sell the trade-in games after they are refurbished.

Sightings of a wooden cargo pallet, along with some belts or straps, which may be linked to the passenger jet, raised hopes.The "first visual sighting" came after fresh Chinese satellite images emerged showing a large floating object in the same region around 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth.Meanwhile, two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin IL-76 planes will head toward the search area early Monday and provide relevant information for Chinese naval search vessels, Commander Liu Dianjun said Sunday.The two planes will fly from RAAF Base Pearce to Perth and will leave for the sea area in the southern Indian Ocean, where objects possibly related to MH370 were spotted by satellites. Liu said the Chinese aircraft will make a roughly eight-hour round-trip flight during their mission, with the furthest point 2,700 kilometers away from Perth.Chinese icebreaker Xuelong is expected to arrive Tuesday at the area in the southern Indian Ocean. The long-serving Antarctic research vessel is still some 1046 kilometers away from the search area, and it will take the icebreaker another 40 hours to get there.The Malaysia Airlines work team in Beijing Sunday had a 7-hour closed-door meeting with families of Chinese passengers on board. One of the relatives said that the plane was unlikely to have descended on land and the fact it disappeared from radar might be caused by the radar limitation, China News Service reported.###2789||In an echo of the Cold War, MasterCard and Visa have stopped processing payments by some Russian banks after the United States issued sanctions over Russia's recent annexation of Crimea.

A MasterCard representative says the brand has pulled out of Rossiya, Sobinbank and SMP Bank, but is still doing business with all other Russian banks. Reps from Visa could not be reached for comment. RT reports that Visa has also cut off SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank; both credit card companies are no longer working with Rossiya Bank. The latter issued a statement apologizing to users.

"The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them," the bank said in a statement to RT.

U.S. officials told The Guardian that Rossiya Bank, a favorite of the Kremlin, will be "frozen out of the dollar." The U.S. Treasury Department has named 20 Russian officials and billionaires, some of whom are President Vladimir Putin's closest friends, in its sanctions. The move freezes assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. banks from doing business with those on the list.

World s###2791||PanARMENIAN.Net - The European Union has reached a deal on a major step toward creating a banking union that is meant to stabilize the financial system and make it easier to deal with troubled banks, the Associated Press reports.

After all night negotiations lasting into Thursday, March 20, EU member states and the parliament broke a deadlock on how to set up a joint authority that can restructure or shut down failing banks.

Corien Wortmann-Kool, a lead negotiator for the parliament, said that "this is very good for restoring confidence in European banks."

She said that under the new rules troubled banks could be dealt with "within a weekend" instead of the protracted process before that often undermined credibility in the EU's financial system.

Negotiators had insisted on reaching a deal before the European elections in May.###2792||Empty###2793||RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.

Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That's a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won't kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group.Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin's personal banker.And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned too. Foreigners probably won't do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations, and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes, and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPOs have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits like Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries.And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia's finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.And then there's Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S., and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It's a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia's stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.Of course, there other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign, and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G-8 is another good idea.But make no mistake about it, deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.That's how difficult this job is going to be.To find out more about Lawrence Kudlow and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate web page at www.creators.com.###2796||Empty###2797||The Fed wasn’t trying to signal a shift toward more restrictive interest rate policies in communications after its Wednesday policy meeting, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview Friday.

Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected. But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.

“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”

Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.

In the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.

Since the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.

Kocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.

“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”

Kocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.

“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.

“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.

Kocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.###2798||The Asia First news database goes back for four months to October 2013 (though in some cases we hold earlier new headlines).

Airbnb could raise between $400 million and $500 million in a round that would value the company at $10 billion, making it among the most valuable online startups in the world, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the company's plans. If completed, the round would be the first for Airbnb since 2012 when the company raised cash on a $2.5 billion valuation.

The accommodations service has been making headlines lately as it looks toward expansion. Earlier this week, the company said that it would consider partnering with other accommodation-like services, such as Uber, or create its own line of products to expand its current offerings. Airbnb didn't say exactly what it has planned.###2801||North Carolina's unemployment rate continued improving in January to near the national average, falling to 6.7 percent, the state Commerce Department reported Monday.



North Carolina's unemployment rate continued improving in January to near the national average, falling to 6.7 percent, the state Commerce Department reported Monday.



The report was the latest to contain mixed messages about how well the state's economy was shaping up for workers and why. While the report found the number of people employed increased by 17,407 between December and January, another survey found nonfarm payrolls recorded 7,200 fewer jobs.



"We've been in this kind of transitional period for years now. There are times when I say I wish I could have some news that was all good or all bad. If it was all good or all bad, it would be easy to interpret," said Andrew Brod, a senior researcher at the business school at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. "You take the numbers as a whole. They're not all good or all bad."



The state's jobless rate of 6.7 percent in January, down from 6.9 percent in December, was almost on par with the national average of 6.6 percent.



The state rate ranked 33rd in the country in January, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Monday. That's a big improvement over the previous January, when North Carolina's unemployment rate of 9.5 percent was among the worst in the country.



The report also marks a missed goal for Gov. Pat McCrory, who said during a campaign debate weeks before his November 2012 election that he wanted North Carolina's unemployment rate to be more favorable than South Carolina after his first year in office. McCrory took office in January 2013.



"The best way to measure things is to benchmark against your competitors, and within a year I hope we're at least beating South Carolina � my gosh, we ought to be at least beating South Carolina," McCrory said during the October 2012 debate.



But South Carolina's unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent in January.



In an email, McCrory spokesman Ryan Tronovitch said: "Gov. McCrory is focused on long-term, sustainable policies that lead to job growth and we have seen a large drop in the unemployment rate through our first year because of that. South Carolina is stiff competition, and we will continue to do all that we can to get people back to work."



The release of the January data was delayed by about a month as researchers revised and updated previous information, an annual process. The results of the revision indicate that the steady drop in North Carolina's unemployment rate had less to do than previously thought with discouraged workers quitting their struggle to find jobs and no longer being counted, Brod said.



About 60,000 dropped out of the pool of people either holding jobs or looking for work in the year ending in January, while nearly 106,000 left the unemployed list, the state report said. That indicated around 60 percent of the decline in the unemployment rate was due to people ending their job searches, for whatever reason, rather than landing jobs, Brod said.



"In terms of the flight from the labor force, it's looking as though last year wasn't as bad as we previously thought," Brod said.###2802||Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's attempt to block the Twitter social media platform proved neither popular nor particularly effective on Friday. The site went black in Turkey late on Thursday, after Erdogan said in a speech that he intended to "wipe out" the service.

Twitter, a brief, 140-character format well suited to sharing links to information elsewhere online, had become a popular vehicle to spread audio recordings that appeared to incriminate Erdogan and other top government officials in corruption cases.

"A complete ban on social media platforms cannot be approved," President Abdullah Gul, a former ally of Erdogan who has become increasingly critical in recent months, wrote in one of five Twitter messages published during the blackout.

"I hope this implementation won't last long," he said in another Tweet. Gul has almost 4.5 million "followers" on the social media platform.

Above-average Turkish traffic

Twitter's own @support handle issued a message telling Turks how they could still write messages on the social media site using SMS "text" messages from their mobile phones. Meanwhile, cheat sheets in the Turkish language, explaining how to circumvent such bans more completely using Internet proxies and other workarounds, were distributed by members of the public in response.

According to the social media analysts at Brandwatch, more Twitter messages emanated from Turkey on Friday - in spite of the ban - than was the case on Wednesday before Erdogan's announcement.

Twitter boasts some 10 million Turkish users, with Turkish-language hash-tags regularly making the list of global trending topics. "#TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey" and "#TurkeyBlockedTwitter" both made the list on Friday.

Turkish voters will take part in local elections on March 30; the campaign has been impacted by the corruption allegations against the government.

The European Union commented critically on the attempted ban, after Erdogan had said he was "not interested" in the international reaction to his decision.

"The ban … raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards," EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Füle said in a statement. Turkey has long sought EU membership but is struggling with several outstanding hurdles to this target - not least the division of EU-member Cyprus.

DAYTONA BEACH — Supporters of the president’s health care law will make one last push on Sunday to sign people up for coverage before the March 31 enrollment deadline and are hoping for an appearance from Vice President Joe Biden to generate interest.

A variety of community groups, along with representatives from insurance carriers, will be at Halifax Health Medical Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday to guide the public through the enrollment process. Organizers have requested an appearance from Biden, but no commitments have been made.

Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said he assisted in organizing the event because he hears often from constituents who are dealing with medical emergencies and lack insurance coverage.

“The intent of the event is to ensure people in middle to lower income America have access to affordable health care,” Henry said. “We want them to be informed. This is an opportunity to enroll in insurance that will meet their needs.”

More than 100,000 people in Volusia and Flagler counties lack insurance coverage. Insurance plans in the federally run online marketplace — HealthCare.gov — are offered by private carriers. Government tax subsidies to make coverage more affordable are available for those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level — about $11,670 to $46,680 for an individual. Those without insurance will face a $95 penalty or 1 percent of their income — whichever is greater. Hardship exemptions are available.

The Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida, which received funds from a federal grant to educate the public about the health care law, has requested Biden or another “high-ranking official” appear in Daytona Beach. While first lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have touted the law elsewhere in the state, no high-ranking officials have visited locally. On Thursday, President Barack Obama visited Valencia College in Orlando to speak on women’s economic issues.

“I’ve been really trying to bang the drum for this community,” said Joyce Case, who oversees enrollment counselors called navigators for the Health Planning Council. “We are always neglected because of Orlando or Jacksonville. We have a very high number of uninsured in our community. We need it just as bad.”

Organizers would likely be given short notice if Biden or another high-ranking member of the administration decided to make an appearance, Case said. Biden recently returned to the states from a visit overseas to deal with the crisis in Ukraine, according to his public schedules.

Florida is seen as a critical state for the success of the Affordable Care Act. It has 3.8 million uninsured residents — the second highest number of any state in the nation. The health care law has met political resistance from the Republican Party in Florida. The state Legislature declined to expand Medicaid with the help of federal dollars because of opposition in the House.

As of March 1, 442,087 Floridians have selected a plan in the marketplace, according to the latest enrollment numbers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Case said she’s noticed interest has been mounting this week as the government ramps up its advertising efforts.

Mincy Pollock, who is helping to organize the event in Daytona Beach, said he hopes that number grows during the last week of enrollment.

He suspects some people are intimidated by the website and the enrollment process.

“We are trying to create an event that’s nonthreatening — sort of fun,” said Pollock, general manager of Jacksonville-based First Coast Multi-Lines Agency, an insurance broker. “We are going to hold their hands through the entire process.”

Those who miss the March 31 deadline can apply for coverage during the next open enrollment, which runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.###2805||Should you invest in gold this festive season?###2806||Why did this happen?

The German measure fell to a six-month low of 46.6 from February’s 55.7, whereas analysts had been expecting a drop to 52.8. A reading above zero indicates optimism.

“In this month’s survey the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts’ economic expectations for Germany,” observes ZEW president Prof. Dr. Clemens Fuest. “Nevertheless, the indicator’s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

ABN Amro Bank economist Aline Schuiling notes that “despite its decline, the ZEW indicator remains well above its long-term average value and at a level consistent with strong growth of the German economy”.

The measure of expert assessment of the current economic situation in Germany climbed 1.3 points to 51.3 points, ZEW reported.

Investor confidence “has been near record levels, and it could have reached a cyclical high,” notes Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet. “It would suggest that the German economy may find it difficult to re-accelerate from here, especially if foreign demand continues to slow down.”

Separately, ZEW’s Eurozone Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell to its lowest reading since December at 61.5 points, down from 68.5 in February and grossly undershooting expectations for 67.3.

The current economic situation indicator climbed 3.5 points to negative 36.7.

In trading so far today, the EUR/GBP has reached its highest point since 27 December at 0.8388, rising for a third consecutive trading day. At press time, the pair is changing hands at 08382, up 0.15 percent from the day’s opening price.

The price action is close to its descending 200-day simple moving average, currently positioned at 0.8394 and which may provide resistance.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due to speak at the Annual Mais Lecture in London at 17:45 UTC today.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers eligible for Obamacare health plans could see double-digit price hikes next year in states that fail to draw large numbers of enrollees for 2014, including some states that have been hostile to the healthcare law, according to insurance industry officials and analysts.

The early estimates come as insurance companies set out to design plans they intend to sell in 2015 through the state-based health insurance marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement that is widely referred to as Obamacare.

WellPoint Inc, which sells plans on 14 Obamacare exchanges, expects health insurance rates nationwide to be higher. Increases for the Obamacare market that has signed up about 5 million people to date is expected to outpace those in the employer-sponsored market, which serves about 170 million people.

"Looking at the rate increases on a year-over-year basis on our exchanges, and it will vary by carrier, but all of them will probably be in double digit plus," Ken Goulet, president of WellPoint's commercial business, told investors in New York on Friday.

The cost of health insurance is already a political hot potato in this year's election campaign for control of Congress, with Republicans warning of the potential for sky-rocketing rates in their attempt to turn the ballot into a referendum on Obamacare.

Insurers have noted the difficulty of building and pricing plans for 2015, which will mark the second year of the Obamacare exchanges. Enrollment for 2014 closes on March 31, giving them very little time to review the costs of covering their new members before submitting proposed rates to insurance regulators in May and June.

Industry officials and independent analysts say the lack of hard data will mean huge variations in premiums, with increases ranging from the high single-digit percentages in some states to as much as 30 percent in others.

Slow enrollment is a potential harbinger of big price hikes in over a dozen states, where technology failures or political opposition to Obamacare may have deterred younger and healthier residents from signing up.

Because the healthcare law prevents insurers from charging sick people higher premiums, the participation of healthy young people is needed to offset the cost of covering policyholders with preexisting conditions. Government data so far has shown about 25 percent of new Obamacare enrollees are in the younger demographic of adults aged 18 to 34, well below the White House's 38 percent target before last October's botched rollout.

Government actuaries predict an 8 percent increase in overall net insurance costs next year. Last week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional committee: "I think premiums are likely to go up, but go up at a slower pace than what we've seen since 2010."

Some analysts say the more dire industry expectations reflect companies' uncertainty rather than the true costs of the market.

"I think it'll be the exception. But there will be some sections of the country with significantly higher insurance premiums," said Larry Levitt, a policy expert at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks healthcare trends.

Levitt predicts that most states will see premium increases of 7 percent to 10 percent in 2015, as insurers compensate for factors including the rising cost of medical services and reduced funding for a temporary federal program that compensates insurers for high claim costs.

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE

Levitt and other analysts said competition between plans should also brake upward price momentum in most states, while some consumers should also benefit from aggressive state insurance regulators unwilling to allow big cost hikes.

Even after the end of open enrollment, a steady stream of new customers is expected to transition into the Obamacare marketplaces throughout 2014, due to life changes that allow for special enrollments, including job loss, marriage and parenthood. As a result, insurers could find themselves under constant pressure to keep prices competitive.

"There's going to be this continuing need to market and get new enrollees," said Sarah Thomas, research director at the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.###2810||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell as much as 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company said the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.''

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...,'' FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Symantec is facing stiff competition from nimbler network security software makers such as Palo Alto Networks and Checkpoint Systems.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you just add this to the list,'' Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for the fourth quarter.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for the tax administration.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

"This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen," George said in a statement. "The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming."

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected. The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the IG's office said.

The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of Social Security numbers, and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.###2816||Empty###2817||New Jersey’s labor market kicked off 2014 on a few sour notes.

According to preliminary data yesterday from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state lost 3,900 jobs during the first month of the year.

Meanwhile, the state made scant progress over the past year toward returning to the peak employment levels it reached exactly six years earlier.

In January 2008, New Jersey boasted a record 4.092 million jobs, according to data provided by Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick in Roseland.

Six years on, the Garden State is more than 167,000 jobs shy of that number, as the state reported an estimated 3.925 million jobs for January. And the 5,600 jobs the state added between January 2013 and January 2014 barely closes the gap.

"In 2013, we made less progress in the recovery than we thought," said O’Keefe, a former deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor.

According to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning think tank, the state has recovered just 37 percent of the jobs it lost during the recession. New York has recovered 163 percent and Pennsylvania 78 percent.

One area where New Jersey has made significant progress is its unemployment rate. The state’s jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent in January from 8.9 percent a year earlier. This drop puts the state closer to the national average, which stood at 6.6 percent in January and climbed to 6.7 percent in February.

But as O’Keefe noted, the drop in New Jersey’s unemployment rate had little to do with people getting jobs, but rather with people dropping out of the labor force. Yesterday’s data showed that the civilian labor force — or the count of working-age people who either have a job or are looking for one — shrank by more than 100,000 over the 12-month period ending in January.

In an interview, state Labor Department Commissioner Harold Wirths said he believed the declines in the labor force are due in part to people retiring rather than just giving up on finding work. But he acknowledged that the state, with its high taxes and heavy regulation, is lagging the nation when it comes to creating jobs.

"We definitely have a lot more work to do," he said. He expects big projects such as the Pulaski Skyway overhaul and completion of the American Dream Meadowlands in East Rutherford to create more jobs.

The January data still is subject to revisions as more complete and accurate data comes in.

"These preliminary numbers almost mean nothing," said Wirths, whose department issues the monthly jobs reports derived from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The first set of revisions occur when the state issues its February jobs report on March 27. The data also may be tweaked again when it undergoes annual "benchmarking" next year, a process meant to make it more accurate.

It was this benchmarking process that state officials gave the most attention yesterday.

Along with the January jobs numbers, the Labor Department also released benchmarked numbers for 2012 and 2013. Among other things, the data showed that the state gained more jobs last year than initially estimated, and that its persistently high unemployment rate has been mostly lower than previously reported.

The average unemployment rate in New Jersey last year was 8.2 percent, rather than 8.4 percent. Meanwhile, the average jobless rate for 2012 was revised down to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent.

Meanwhile, the state added 18,800 jobs in 2013, compared to earlier estimates that it would add just 10,100 jobs. All of the job gains were in the private sector, while the public sector shed 1,000 jobs last year. Earlier estimates saw the private sector gain just 7,300 positions last year. Also, December’s job losses, initially reported at 36,300, were revised lower to 19,100 jobs lost.

However, any boost this provided was offset by the finding that 2012 provided a smaller job haul than originally reported. Yesterday’s benchmarked data showed that the state gained just 43,900 jobs in 2012, or about a third less than the 66,400 jobs originally reported for the year.

With respect to the January and December job losses, the bitter winter did play a part, Charles Steindel, chief economist for the state Department of Treasury said in a statement, though he expects this too will abate.

"As is typically the case after such an episode, there’s a good chance the pace will pick up as the temperatures rise," he wrote.###2818||Bruno Guillon has quit as Mulberry chief executive this morning two months after the luxury fashion chain issued a profit warning.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”###2819||Empty###2820||Empty###2821||Carl Icahn won't give up on nagging eBay over selling PayPal (among many other things), but a new suggestion demonstrates he might be backing down -- albeit slightly.

The American business magnate published yet another open letter to eBay shareholders on Wednesday, outlining a scheme in which eBay sells off 20 percent of PayPal through an initial public offering.

As described by Icahn, the online marketplace conglomerate would then be able to keep the majority of PayPal.

Aside from the rather lengthy proposal, Icahn reiterated his disappointment (to put it lightly) in eBay's leadership:

Over the last few weeks, we have raised a number of troubling questions regarding corporate governance at eBay. Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay. Now, we have given a basic overview of the reasons we believe a 20% IPO of PayPal could be advantageous for the companies, employees and stockholders. We hope that eBay’s management is paying attention and decides to respond to this first message on the topic in a productive, transparent manner.

Icahn concluded by stressing he believes in the value of PayPal, but warned "it is on the verge of going to war against strong adversaries, and only with the benefits of being an independent company, as described above, will PayPal be capable of winning that war."

This new suggestion regarding the future of the digital payments brand is only the latest incursion between eBay and Icahn's inventment group empire.

The trouble with eBay started in January amid the company's fourth quarter earnings report. At the time, Icahn suggested (putting it mildly) that PayPal should be spun off .

Ebay didn't agree .

By the end of February , Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of the board of eBay Inc., published a pointed letter rebuffing Icahn's public criticism of eBay CEO John Donahue as well as two prominent shareholders, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Intuit founder Scott Cook.

Since then there has been a flurry of public memos and outbursts volleyed back and forth, including one by Icahn arguing that Icahn that Andreessen had too many conflicts during the Skype sale , putting up his reputation for further scrutiny.

Then last week , eBay took things to a new level in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, urging shareholders to ignore both Icahn's nominees for the board of directors while encouraging them to re-elect CEO John Donahoe and director Fred Anderson.###2822||Empty###2823||Empty###2824||Toyota Motor Corp. will pay $1.2 billion to resolve a criminal probe into its handling of consumer complaints over safety issues, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.

Toyota admitted it misled American consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about two safety issues, each of which caused a type of unintended acceleration, the Justice Department said.

The settlement resolves a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities.

Toyota faces hundreds of lawsuits over acceleration problems that gained public attention after the deaths of a California highway patrolman and his family, which were reportedly caused by the unintended acceleration of his Toyota-made Lexus.

The faulty acceleration prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles, beginning in 2009.

Last year, Toyota received approval on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims from Toyota owners that the value of their cars dropped after the problems came to light. It is also negotiating with hundreds of customers who said they had been injured.

"Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said on Wednesday. "During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."###2825||Kolin Burges, a Mt. Gox customer, protests outside the headquarters of Mt. Gox and its parent company, Tibanne Co., in Tokyo, Feb. 25, 2014. Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins still remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

The Associated Press###2826||Empty###2827||Empty###2828||Though it may seem an odd choice in the era of digital downloads and consoles that very-nearly abolished used games altogether, Wal-Mart has announced that it plans to begin accepting game trade-ins as soon as March 26th in 3,100 of its stores.

The news comes via GameSpot, who attended a recent Wal-Mart conference call hosted by Duncan Mac Naughton, the company’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. Though the service should offer a potentially interesting alternative to GameStop and Best Buy, there is a catch: you can only trade for store credit.

Of course, Wal-Mart doesn’t see this as a bad thing, and maybe you shouldn’t either. Because Wal-Mart sells such a wide range of products, you really can buy anything you’d like with the store credit. While you can also do this with the cash you get from GameStop, it does require leaving and heading to another store. Also, it remains to be seen if Wal-Mart’s credits will amount to more cash than GameStop generally offers. If so, they may be on to something.

Traded games will be refurbished by a third party company, and there will be a set process to how a game is exchanged. GameSpot detailed the process in their report, as can be seen below.

Here’s how Wal-Mart’s used-game program works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called ''Savings Catcher'' on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.'s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for ''technological answers to saving them money and time.''

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's ''every day low price'' model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.

''They're doing the work for me,'' said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. ''The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away.''

The company did not divulge any reason for the removal of Bennett but said its priority is to find a leader who can drive propel innovation and growth at the company.

The announcement sent Symantec shares tumbling 9 percent in after-hours trade on the Nasdaq.

In a statement, Symantec said the exit of Bennett follows an ongoing deliberative process and was not due to any event or impropriety. Bennett also resigned from the Symantec board.

Symantec said a special committee of the board will begin the search for a permanent CEO.

Incoming CEO Brown joined the Symantec board after its merger with Veritas Software in July 2005.

Earlier Brown served as chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp and more recently has been a board chairman and CEO coach for firms prior to their acquisitions, including EqualLogic and Echo Nest.

Brown also will remain on the Symantec board, but will cease to serve on its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee or Nominating and Governance Committee.

Symantec reaffirmed its guidance for the fourth quarter, projecting net earnings of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share and revenue of $1.615 billion to $1.655 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $0.42 per share on revenue of $1.64 billion for the quarter.

Symantec, which makes Norton anti-virus software, has laid off workers and streamlined its to soften the impact of weak PC sales that have impacted demand for its anti-virus software. The company has been battling with falling sales for the past quarters.

Earlier this month Symantec named Thomas Seifert as chief financial officer. Seifert was previously the CFO at Brightstar and AMD (AMD).

Symantec stock closed Thursday at $20.91, up $0.33 or 1.58%, on a volume of 5.5 million shares on the Nasdaq. In after hours, the stock $1.91 or 9.11% at $19.00. In the past year, the stock has traded in the range of $20.01 - $27.10.

Over the last five years, Pandora One has been able to keep its cost steady, charging subscribers of the service $3.99 per month. As content costs have gone upwards however, with Pandora claiming that the royalty rates it pays performers via SoundExchange have increased 53 percent in the last five years, Pandora has announced that its subscription model is undergoing some changes. The main focal point of these changes is that Pandora One will go up in price, costing listeners $4.99 per month, or $1 more per month. The change is not set to take effect until May of this year, and customers can even lock in the current price on a new loyalty program if they subscribe before the change is implemented.

It is worth noting that the annual subscription option for Pandora One is ending, forcing subscribers of the service to pay monthly. The advertisement laden version of Pandora will still be available for free for listeners who chose to not subscribe to Pandora One.###2836||A woman looks at the Obamacare HealthCare insurance exchange Internet site (AFP)

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration published in the Federal Register new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would have to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning January 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

“Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can’t finish, we won’t shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don’t have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can’t get coverage again until next year,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare’s six-month enrollment period. Most of those bugs have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website’s capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.

LONDON, United Kingdom — Mulberry Group Plc said Bruno Guillon will step down as chief executive officer after two years during which the British luxury handbag maker lost two-thirds of its market value.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Hermes International SCA in March 2012, will leave immediately, Somerset, England-based Mulberry said today in a statement. Former CEO Godfrey Davis, the company’s non-executive chairman, will become executive chairman until a successor is found, Mulberry said.

Guillon’s plan to raise prices and expand Mulberry globally failed to resonate with consumers. In January, Mulberry said profit would be substantially below estimates because of weak sales in the U.K. and order cancellations in South Korea.

Mulberry creative director Emma Hill, who was credited with driving the company’s growth with bags such as the Alexa, quit last year after disagreeing with Guillon on strategy, a person familiar with the situation said at the time.

The shares fell 2.1 percent to 636.5 pence yesterday in London. They have slumped 67 percent since Guillon joined.

By: Andrew Roberts###2840||If GameStop and Walmart were cowboys, this is the part where we’d all have to run for safety behind the barber and saloon while they stared each other down at high noon.

Walmart, the world’s largest megaretailer, is getting into the used-games business in the U.S. The company revealed today that it will start accepting trade-ins March 26. The company will give customers gift cards in exchange for old games, and those cards are good for any item at Walmart or Sam’s Club. This strategy could help one of the largest retail operations pick up a bigger chunk of the $13 billion that U.S. consumers spend on games at retail. This may also force GameStop, the huge gaming-specific retailer in the U.S., to offer better used-game prices to keep up with the competition.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,” Walmart chief marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said in a statement. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

We’ve reached out to GameStop for a comment on this. We’ll update this story with any new information. In addition to Walmart and GameStop, companies like Amazon and Best Buy all accept used games in exchange for store credit.

While the trade-in program starts next week, Walmart won’t begin selling used games until later this year — likely after it builds up an inventory. When a trade-in begins, the stores will examine each game disc to make sure it is operational. The company will then refurbish the discs to sell in a “like new” condition.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy preowned games,” Mac Naughton said.

Walmart isn’t new to offering gift cards for old items. The retailer currently accepts tablets and smartphones in exchange for credit at its stores. It also sells those refurbished items on its website. We’ve reached out to the company to ask if this means it will also accept used gaming hardware. We’ll update this post once we have that information.

Turkish dailies on Friday covered Thursday’s attack on Turkish security forces in central Turkey, which killed three people including a police officer and a soldier.

HURRIYET headlined “Assassination team,” claiming three gunmen, who departed from the southern province of Hatay, were heading to Istanbul to attack critical targets. They mounted an assault on Turkish soldiers when they were caught during a routine check on a highway in Nigde province. A police officer, a soldier and a civilian were killed while five others were wounded.

However, unlike the typical video game trade-in program, Walmart is hoping to leverage its general product selection as a key advantage against GameStop, despite the world's largest retailer never referencing the specialty chain by name.

Beginning on March 26th, Walmart will expand its game trade-in program to 3100 locations across the country, while used game sales are expected to begin later this Summer both in-store and online.

The expansion will also bring a new "certified pre-owned" section to the stores and online for game trade-ins. Ironically, the program goes live today for all Walmart employees before the official public launch, while Walmart will be able to pad out their used game inventory ahead of time.

The program relies on games from all current platforms and Walmart is boasting to the media that its average credit payout per game will be at least $35, significantly more than GameStop offers for games. Of course, the kicker is that while GameStop's program is limited to buying game-related products in its stores and online portal, Walmart wants the program to drive store and online sales with gift cards loaded with store credit in exchange for games. Oddly, the program currently excludes trade-ins of consoles.

On one hand, GameStop has to sit up and pay attention to this because it could get enough traction to cut into its trade-in volume, if marketed in the right way. On the other hand, limiting the trade-in program to games with original packaging means that GameStop still has some sort of advantage for older games.

One thing I'm curious to see is how people will game the trade-in program. Would you trade in your games at Walmart over GameStop or Amazon, or do you use other methods to get rid of games you don't play anymore? Below, the first TV ad announcing the program.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index inched up by 1.52 points or 0.08 percent to 2,025.20 points Tuesday. The Shenzhen Component Index nudged down by 66.67 points or 0.91 percent to 7,273.95 points.



Combined turnover on the two bourses on Tuesday was 202 billion yuan ($32.62 billion), up from Monday's 174.75 billion yuan.



On Tuesday, shares linked to environmental protection and liquor were among the biggest winners.



Premium liquor maker Kweichow Moutai jumped by 2.91 percent to 171.32 yuan following media reports that the State-owned company is seeking a separate listing of one of its subsidiaries.



Shares in property developers fell after growth in new house prices slowed for a second consecutive month in February, with fewer cities seeing month-on-month rises in new house prices.



New home prices in 70 major cities tracked by the National Bureau of Statistics increased by an average of 8.64 percent in February year-on-year, 0.86 percentage points lower than January.



Leading developers China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co fell by 2.06 percent to 7.60 yuan and 2.82 percent to 6.88 yuan, respectively.



Recent falls in gold prices dragged down gold companies, with the overall gold sector falling by 1.5 percent on Tuesday. Gold prices remained weak on Tuesday falling about 1 percent in New York.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the new lead in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was promising, but cautioned that the search in the icy southern Indian Ocean remained difficult.

“It’s a lot of water to look for just perhaps a tiny object,” Truss told ABC Radio. “Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and the forecast ahead is not that good so it’s going to be a challenge, but we will stick at it.”

Truss said the object spotted by a French satellite, which was reported to Malaysia on Sunday, was 850 km (528 miles) north of the current search areas for the Boeing 777 that vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board.

“That’s not in the area that had been identified as the most likely place where the aircraft had entered the sea,” Truss said.

Australia had used a U.S. satellite image of two floating objects to frame a search area some 2,500 km (1,430 miles) southwest of Perth.

Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing. Most of the passengers were Chinese.

A total of 10 planes, including Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 and Japanese P-3C aircraft joining the search for the first time, are due to sweep a 68,000 sq km area on Monday.

The crews are zeroing in on the areas around where the earlier sightings were made in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris, including a wooden pallet, spotted by a search plane on Saturday.

China said the object it had seen on the satellite image was 22 metres long (74ft) and 13 metres (43ft) wide.

It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same as those detected by Australia, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, said a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search.

The wing of a Boeing 777-200ER is approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base, according to estimates derived from publicly available scale drawings. Its fuselage is 63.7 metres long by 6.2 metres wide.

NASA INVOLVED

NASA said it would use high-resolution cameras aboard satellites and the International Space Station to look for possible crash sites in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. space agency is also mining archived images collected by instruments on its Terra and Aqua environmental satellites, said NASA spokesman Allard Beutel.

“Our satellites and space-based cameras are designed for long-term scientific data gathering and Earth observation. They’re really not meant to look for a missing aircraft, and obviously NASA isn’t a lead agency in this effort. But we’re trying to support the search, if possible,” Beutel said.

Truss said the aircraft flying on Monday would be focused on searching by sight, rather than radar, which can be tricky to use because of the high seas and wind in the area. Civil aircraft, which can carry more people, have joined the search.

Truss warned that the search could be hampered further by a cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.

“Clearly it won’t be cyclonic when it gets down into the southern waters where we are dealing with this search, but certainly it could stir up less favourable weather ... and looking visibly for debris or anything of interest is the best chance of success,” he said.

HIJACK OR SABOTAGE?

Investigators believe someone on the flight shut off the plane’s communications systems, and partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and re-crossing the Malay Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

That has led them to focus on hijacking or sabotage, but investigators have not ruled out technical problems. Faint electronic “pings” detected by a commercial satellite suggested it flew for another six hours or so, but could do no better than place its final signal on one of two vast arcs.

The lack of solid news has meant a prolonged and harrowing wait for families of the passengers, who have complained both in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur about the absence of information, many breaking down with grief.

A Malaysian statement said a “high-level” team briefed relatives in Beijing on Sunday in a meeting that lasted more than six hours.

While the southern arc is now the main focus of the search, Malaysia says efforts will continue in both corridors until confirmed debris is found.

“We still don’t even know for certain if the aircraft is in this area,” Truss said of the southern Indian Ocean search. “We’re just clutching at whatever little piece of information that comes along to try to find the place we can concentrate the efforts.”###2852||Pandora One to Increase in Price

March 20, 2014

Category: General News Posted:02:37AMAuthor: gebraset

Over the last five years, Pandora One has been able to keep its cost steady, charging subscribers of the service $3.99 per month. As content costs have gone upwards however, with Pandora claiming that the royalty rates it pays performers via SoundExchange have increased 53 percent in the last five years, Pandora has announced that its subscription model is undergoing some changes. The main focal point of these changes is that Pandora One will go up in price, costing listeners $4.99 per month, or $1 more per month. The change is not set to take effect until May of this year, and customers can even lock in the current price on a new loyalty program if they subscribe before the change is implemented.

It is worth noting that the annual subscription option for Pandora One is ending, forcing subscribers of the service to pay monthly. The advertisement laden version of Pandora will still be available for free for listeners who chose to not subscribe to Pandora One.###2853||Mega retailer Walmart is jumping into the used video game business, the company announced today.

Beijing (ANTARA News/Xinhua-OANA) - China paid great attention to Australias possible findings related to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Thursday.



Two objects possibly related to flight MH370 have been sighted by satellite in the remote southern Indian Ocean, Australian officials said Thursday.



Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that "new and credible information" based on satellite imagery had come to light, and that four long-range surveillance planes were being diverted to look into the find in the southern Indian Ocean.



China expects the Australian side to send vessels and airplanes as soon as possible to related waters for search and verification, said Hong.



He said the Chinese Foreign Ministry has ordered the embassy and consulates in Australia to keep in close touch with the Australian authorities and assist the Australian side in the searching and rescuing work.



The Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, mysteriously disappeared in the early hours of March 8. A total of 239 people were on board, including 154 Chinese passengers.

(U.C003)###2855||When you think of drought, your mind might go to empty reservoirs and parched hillsides. Not necessarily declining school attendance.

But in parts of California, a lack of rain has dried up jobs — farm jobs in particular — and many families have opted to move elsewhere, often pulling their kids from school.

At some schools, this has meant less state money since school funding is based on classroom attendance.

California schools Superintendent Tom Torlakson announced Wednesday that he would exercise his power under the governor’s drought emergency declaration to stabilize funding at schools that are losing money because of lost jobs. The announcement was made in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley.

“Some impacts of the drought seem obvious as we see water levels drop while fire risks and food prices climb,” he said in a prepared statement. “But one of the less obvious impacts is happening every day in our classrooms, where empty desks reflect children whose families could no longer find work on the farms and ranches of the Central Valley.”

Ag jobs disappear when there’s less water to irrigate and fields that are normally farmed go unplanted.

In Fresno County, the state’s most agriculturally productive county, attendance at many rural schools has dropped because families of farm laborers have moved on, according to the county Office of Education.

A spokesperson said attendance records don’t specify which children have left because of the drought, and which ones moved on for other reasons, but that the trend is clear. Over the next few months, state education leaders are expected to work with local school districts to quantify the numbers of students lost to the dry weather so that the schools can be reimbursed.###2856||Empty###2857||An early surge on the stock market evaporated Friday, as health care stocks tugged major indexes down.Biotech companies were especially hard-hit after U.S. lawmakers questioned the pricing of a Hepatitis C drug made by Gilead Sciences.The Standard & Poor's 500 index raced past an all-time high in early trading, then lost steam in the afternoon.

Airbnb Inc. is poised to join the 11-digit club.

The company, which was created nearly six years ago as a way to help people find spare rooms and couches to sleep on, is in advanced talks to raise more than $400 million in capital, a round of financing that would value it at more than $10 billion, people briefed on the matter said Thursday.

Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology startup firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing startups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday.

But Airbnb, a centerpiece of what has become known as “the sharing economy,” is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws, and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords, too.

Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added.

The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, may still fall apart, these people cautioned.

Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $170 billion — paid more than $16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $10 billion, while Palantir, a data analysis firm, has raised money at a $9 billion valuation.

“We’re seeing valuations go nuts,” said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.

Even so, Ellis conceded that many of the companies now in the limelight were a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits.

Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated — and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities.###2860||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

BRUSSELS, March 20 — EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord today on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy.

Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People’s Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP’s Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the Eurozone’s 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long. — AFP###2863||GameStop’s (NYSE:GME) stock dropped more than 4% Tuesday morning on reports that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) would be announcing its foray into the used game trade business. The market is rife with rumors that Wal-Mart will start offering store credit to customers looking to trade in their old video games. [ ] Used game sales account for 30% of GameStop’s revenues and half of the company’s gross profit.

GameStop recently reported a 7% increase in used game sales during the holiday season, driven by strong demand for previous generation used-games. [ ] The company has successfully warded off competition from Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), which entered the used game domain in 2010, but it now faces a new threat from Wal-Mart. [ ]

GameStop is expected to report earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 later this month. [ ]

Can Wal-Mart Take Market Share From GameStop?

GameStop is the biggest video game retailer in the U.S., with more than half of the Xbox 360 and PS3 titles sold in the U.S. during the September quarter coming through the company’s stores. Wal-Mart also offers games and consoles at its stores but has so far been unable to take market share from GameStop.

Wal-Mart is well known for its low-price strategy and also offers a variety of items for shoppers, whereas GameStop offers just video games and consoles. Exchanging used games for store credit might be more lucrative for customers who are not just looking to trade in their old game for another game but can use the store credit to buy other items such as groceries or apparel. Electronics or entertainment items account for around 10% of Wal-Mart’s revenues, but it still has a market share of 15% in consumer electronics. On the other hand, Best Buy, which specializes in consumer electronics, has a market share of 22%. [ ]

However, GameStop has a loyal customer base, with over 31 million PowerUp Reward members. The company offers special deals and has built up good relations with its customers. For example, during the launch of Disney Infinity, GameStop offered customers the opportunity to pre-order over $400 worth of characters playable in the game. GameStop was also the only U.S. retailer to offer the exclusive $150 collector’s edition of Grand Theft Auto V. The loyalty of this base and the specialization in the niche video game market is GameStop’s biggest strong point, which might help it ward off the Wal-Mart threat.

Unlike Best Buy, GameStop has been relatively unfazed by the ‘showrooming’ phenomena, whereby customers go to a brick and mortar store to see a product and eventually buy from online retailers like Amazon and eBay. The company’s market share has remained largely unchanged for the last few years.

GameStop’s used game sales are highly correlated with new game sales, as the latter help replenish the company’s inventory; pre-owned game sales have consistently been around 65% of new software sales for the last four years. We expect the company to suffer a minor loss in market share, but it will still be able to gain as the new-console cycle progresses. We expect a 5% increase in used game sales through the coming years, but there is a 15% downside to our price estimate for GameStop should the growth be below 3% through the decade.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses a rally of his Justice and Development Party in Elazig, Turkey, Thursday, March 6, 2014. (AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici)

Continuing our series of Monkey Cage Election Reports, the following is a pre-election report on the upcoming Turkish local elections from King’s College London Ph.D. candidate Aaron Stein.

*****

On Dec. 17, swarms of Turkish police, acting at the behest of prosecutors known to have links to the Gulen movement, arrested the sons of three cabinet ministers and at least 34 others for graft. The move signaled the definitive end to the alliance of convenience between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Imam who presides over a global movement of followers dubbed the Hizmet (or Service) movement.

In response, the Gulen movement has leaked numerous audio recordings online that purportedly implicate Erdogan, his family, and many of his closest advisers in corruption. The recordings have rocked Turkish politics and have prompted Erdogan to rely heavily on nationalism, political polarization, and questionable legal tactics to frame the allegations as a massive conspiracy aimed at forcing him from power. Erdogan has since directed the bureaucracy to purge members of the police force of suspected Gulen sympathizers, sidelined the graft probe’s prosecutors, and is believed that have played a direct role in the government’s recent decision to shut down access to Twitter. In doing so, Erdogan has sought to transform the March 30 local election into a referendum on his tenure as prime minister, and, by extension, to use populist electoral tactics to absolve him of graft allegations.

To ensure that a criminal case is not pursued, Erdogan is resorting to “strongman” tactics that are eroding the foundation of Turkey’s democratic system. While the Gulenists’ use of leaked audio recordings are far from perfect, their recent actions are a reflection of Erdogan’s previous willingness to use them to advance his own political interests, regardless of the rule of law.

According to political scientist Joel S. Migdal, “strongman” leaders operating in “weak states” sometimes have an incentive to weaken the bureaucracy to ensure that rival political actors don’t accrue the tools and power needed to overthrow them. They therefore have a perverse incentive to weaken certain elements of the bureaucracy, while favoring others. Erdogan has used this tactic before, but, in a significant contrast from the present, the Turkish prime minister previously used the Gulen movement to weaken his main political enemy, the military, and other Kemalist strongholds in the bureaucracy.

The alliance has never been all that cozy and the rash of audio recordings that have since leaked clearly indicate that the Gulen movement had been making preparations to defend itself, should its alliance with the AKP falter. Nevertheless, after the 2002 election, Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Gulenists had an incentive to cooperate. The two Islamist movements, despite having different political aspirations/worldviews, had a shared incentive to further liberalize Turkish society and to curb the power of the military. And, in order to do so, both needed to gain more political power.

After the AKP narrowly avoided being closed down for alleged “anti-secular activities” in 2008, Erdogan and his allies launched a judicial counter offensive spearheaded by the same Gulen allied prosecutors who had launched the recent AKP graft raids.

The two trials, known as Ergenekon and Balyoz, were originally intended to curb the power of Turkey’s “deep state” – and by extension, the military, and other Kemalist secular strongholds like the constitutional court – but eventually grew to include well-known critics of the AKP and Gulen on trumped up charges of terrorism/coup plotting. The evidence for the Balyoz trial hinged on electronic documents that technical analysis has since shown was digitally altered. Nevertheless, the court sentenced 300 military officers to lengthy prison sentences.

Yet, while the AKP certainly succeeded in curbing the power of Turkey’s military, it did so through the use of a bureaucratic proxy that posed an indirect challenge to Erdogan’s authority. Thus, after the military had been marginalized, Erdogan soon faced a new political threat, that he himself helped create. And, like other leaders before him, he had a choice: accept the status quo and try to appease the Hizmet – which would thereby have created a non-AKP allied power center in the bureaucracy – or work to curb the movement’s influence. Erdogan opted for the latter over the former. A clash was inevitable.

To counteract the Gulenists’ influence in the judiciary and police force, Erdogan has since taken steps to bring the judiciary under his indirect control, moved to tighten the state’s control over social media, and has increased the power of Turkey’s intelligence agency – which is headed by a close political ally. Yet, just like in the case of Ergenekon and Balyoz, the tactics are at odds with established democratic procedure, and thereby erode the AKP’s stated intention of strengthening Turkish democracy.

Nevertheless, Erdogan has championed the ballot box as the final arbiter of all that ails Turkish politics. Yet, in doing so, Erdogan is practicing majoritarian politics in an increasingly polarized political climate. Thus, as Turks prepare to vote in local elections this March, an AKP victory in key cities like Ankara and Istanbul could spark further anti-government protests. To counteract such a possibility, the government is certain to take more steps to ensure that the right to peaceful protest is further encroached upon.

And, when paired with the likely leaking of more recordings, Erdogan is sure to deem it necessary to further increase his hold over the government bureaucracy. Thus, even while Erdogan appears to have calculated that increased political polarization is the key to electoral success, it has come at a steep price for Turkish democracy.

While the AKP’s poll numbers may only decrease by a few percentage points (or perhaps not change at all), it will soon be faced with the prospect of governing an incredibly fractured electorate, and a sizeable minority who may deem Erdogan to be illegitimate. The scenario suggests that Erdogan may continue to resort to the strongman tactics he has been using to try to stifle dissent, both inside the bureaucracy and on the streets. And, more broadly, how elections can have “anti-democratic” implications.###2868||WASHINGTON

Boeing's design and manufacture of its cutting-edge 787 jetliner is safe despite the many problems encountered since the plane's rollout, according to a report issued jointly Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration and the aircraft maker.

The review concluded the aircraft was soundly designed, met its intended safety level and that the manufacturer and the FAA had effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta asked for the review after a lithium-ion battery caught fire on a 787 parked at Logan International Airport in Boston. A battery aboard another 787 failed less than two weeks later.

NEW YORK

JPMorgan said Wednesday it is selling its physical commodities business for $3.5 billion, after new regulations crimped its ability to control power plants, warehouses and oil refineries.

If approved by regulators, the deal would put the commodities business in the hands of energy and commodities trading company Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

Big banks have long profited from price swings in metals, energy and other commodities. But some had branched out into owning physical facilities as well. Last summer, JPMorgan said the possibility of new regulations on whether banks could continue to do that was a factor in its decision to sell some of its physical commodities business.

DALLAS

FedEx Corp. said its latest quarterly profit rose 5 percent from a year ago, despite storms that raised the company's costs.

The company's ground-shipping segment is doing better, but the express-delivery business is flat and customers continue to shift to slower, cheaper services for international shipments.

The quarter's results were below analysts' expectations. The weak quarter drove FedEx to lower its profit forecast for the year.

NEW YORK

Starbucks turned its shareholders meeting into an episode of the Oprah Winfrey show on Wednesday.

The celebrity talk show host appeared on stage to announce a drink called the Oprah Chai that will be sold at Starbucks cafes starting April 29. The drink will also be available at the small chain of Teavana tea shops Starbucks recently bought.

The splashy move comes as Starbucks Corp. looks to tap into tea as a new sales driver. Starbucks cafes are still enjoying strong sales growth, but the company is also facing intensifying competition as fast-food chains and others crowd the coffee market.

NEW YORK

Plain old Cheerios are no longer made with genetically modified ingredients, but the switch hasn't yet translated to a boost in sales.

General Mills, the company that makes the cereal, announced in January it would start making its plain Cheerios without GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. The move came after a campaign by the group Green America, which prompted fans to express their support.

On Wednesday, CEO Ken Powell said the company has gotten supportive letters and online comments for its decision but hasn't detected a sales lift.

Compiled from wire reports###2869||New York: The world’s major stock markets dipped while yields on the US treasuries rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve dropped the unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the US economy’s strength and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.

At the same time, the US central bank said dropping a promise to hold rates steady “well past the time” the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5% did not indicate any change in the Fed’s policy intentions.

Wall Street reacted with a modest sell-off with major indexes falling to session lows shortly after the statement from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets—the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015,” said Thomas di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.

The benchmark 10-year treasury notes yield rose 7.5 basis points to 2.753% while the 5-year notes yields surged 12 basis points to 1.67%.

The 3-year treasuries yields rose 10.5 basis points to 0.862%, the highest level since January.

In the currency market, the euro and the yen extended losses against the dollar.

The central bank proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of the US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.79 points or 0.3%, to 16,287.4, the S&P 500 lost 4.43 points or 0.24%, to 1,867.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.02 points or 0.25%, to 4,322.293.

The FTSEurofirst 300 edged down 0.03%, at 1,305.68 points, while the euro zone’s blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index was up 0.2% at 3,078.78 points. Reuters###2870||Empty###2871||TVA needs better reviews

The Tennessee Valley Authority is improving the timeliness with which is handles complaints from its non-nuclear staff, but a new audit of worker concerns found "some employees feel that concerns are not being adequately addressed and reported experiencing pressure and repercussions from management."

In a report released Monday, TVA's Inspector General recommends that TVA identify an individual to audit and assess employee concerns after the cases are closed. The IG also thinks TVA needs to do a better job of investigating claims of retaliation by managers against workers who voice concerns. TVA management agreed to implement better programs.

Jobless rate falls in U.S.

Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January, including Tennessee and Georgia, as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state -- Iowa -- where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month.

Rates were Alabama and five other states and declined from 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent in Tennessee and from 7.6 percent to 7.4 percent in Georgia. The national jboless rate in Janaury was 6.6 percent.###2872||(Inserts percentage gains for China Vanke and Poly Read Estate in last paragraph)

HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - China shares rose on Monday, lifted by property and infrastructure counters after Beijing announced plans to speed the pace of urbanisation.

The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 1 percent at 2,023.67 points.

The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also rose 1 percent.

Chinese property developers China Vanke and Poly Real Estate gained 3.1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, after the government outlined infrastructure investment plans aimed at raising the proportion of the population living in cities to 60 percent by 2020 from 53.7 percent now.

Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###2875||Hold Up! Oscar Winner Rita Moreno Will Not Join IN THE HEIGHTS Film

With Airbnb just days from closing a large new funding round that will value the company at $10 billion, its founders are about to become billionaires.

Cofounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia will all maintain personal stakes of just over 15% of the company after the dilution of this raise, according to knowledgeable sources, which will net Airbnb between $400 and $500 million. At about a $10 billion valuation, that makes each cofounder’s personal stake in the San Francisco-based company worth just over $1.5 billion, vaulting them into the ranks of the world's youngest billionaires.

The new round, which will close in the next one to two weeks, is being led by Fort Worth, Tex.-based private equity firm TPG Capital, with a number of other investors, not all of whom are expected to sign on at once, but in tranches over time, sources tell Forbes. Airbnb declined to comment on both the round and the cofounders' personal stakes.

Don’t expect Chesky, 32, Gebbia, 32, and Blecharczyk, 30, to go buy their own Necker Island anytime soon—those riches are still largely tied to Airbnb’s future in stock, and the founders prefer to live simply. Chesky and Gebbia, who first came up with the idea for Airbnb in 2008 as Rhode Island School of Design grads transplanted to San Francisco, still live in the same apartment in the South of Market neighborhood where they started the company. Blecharczyk, who joined early that year as cofounder and CTO of what was then called Airbedandbreakfast.com, still bikes to work, according to an Airbnb insider. And much like Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick has been known to drive cabs around town, Chesky will still list his apartment on Airbnb once in a while to personally test out the local listings.

“People providing these services in many ways are entrepreneurs or micro-entrepreneurs,” Chesky said in a Forbes cover story last year. “They’re more independent, more liberated, a little more economically empowered.”

Airbnb’s become a leader of the share economy, with over 600,000 listings across 160 countries used by millions of annual guests, and 11 million in its five-year history. The company says New Year's Eve 2013 it had a record 250,000 guests in one night; a guest checks somewhere in the world each 2 seconds. While Airbnb does not disclose revenue, it takes 3% from a host’s booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.

The trio’s first funding came in 2009, when they got into famed tech incubator Y Combinator and eventually impressed founder Paul Graham as well as Sequoia Capital, who put up $600,000 in seed funds after the program. The company’s raised money from a range of Silicon Valley elite investors since Sequoia, which was joined in a Series A round by Greylock, SV Angel, and angels including Ashton Kutcher. In 2011, it raised $112 million at a valuation north of $1 billion led by Andreessen Horowitz and joined by DST and General Catalyst Partners as well as Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos. The next year, it raised $200 million in a Series C round led by Founders Fund along with its existing investments in a deal that values the company around $2.5 billion.

Now the company’s sitting on a $10 billion valuation from private equity sources. No word yet whether existing investors have re-upped in the round, but an insider tells Forbes that it's unlikely that the founder or early investors will use this new raise to cash out and gain liquidity from their positions.

By turning to private equity sources for its latest cash and lofty valuation, Airbnb’s signaling that it’s taken another critical step in the life cycle of a private tech company. For TPG, it means a foot in what could prove an extremely popular eventual public offering, possibly later in 2014, while private equity funds often come with generous valuations and dilution concerns for founders looking for guidance as they begin to consider preparing for Wall Street investors.

Airbnb’s cofounders join Dropbox cofounder Drew Houston and WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton as recent tech entrepreneurs to join the billionaire ranks. When the round closes, Blecharczyk will become among the world's youngest, a group which includes Facebookers Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz and 24-year-old Hong Kong citizen Perenna Kei.

ANKARA - Blocking access to Twitter is not good for Turkey's international reputation, but doing nothing could have caused even worse repercussions, Turkey's Deputy PM Ali Babacan said Friday.

The most senior voice on economy in Turkey's ruling AK Party, Babacan told private broadcaster NTV that Turkey was left with no choice but do something to protect its people's rights of privacy.

"Sometimes you have to choose between two evils, and you choose the lesser of the two," he said referring to official telecommunications authority's decision to block access to the social media site.

He predicted that Twitter would not remain blocked in Turkey for too long and called for a solution to be reached reciprocally between Turkey and Twitter.

"There is a stark contrast between the fast progress of technology and the introduction of judicial frameworks to regulate and audit technology," Babacan said.

He noted that the decision was not a nice and agreeable one and added that sometimes this kind of ugly decisions need to be taken to protect people's rights.

Turkey's official telecommunications board TIB blocked access to Twitter on Thursday night, citing a handful of court orders as the basis for blocking its content.

Earlier, an omnibus bill introduced on February 28 made headlines in Turkey as it allowed TIB to block access to websites without prior court approval.

Copyright 2014 ABC News Radio###2894||The euro declined against the US dollar on trading Tuesday, after building permits in the US rose more-than-expected in February, backing the case for further stimulus cuts before the Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting later today.

EUR/USD touched a session low at 1.3890 at 10:00 GMT, after which the pair trimmed some losses to trade at 1.3902 at 14:08 GMT, losing 0.14% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 1.3880, while resistance was to be encountered at March 17th high, 1.3948.

Building permits for future projects rose 7.7% to a 1.018 million annualized pace last month, the most since October, data by the US Department of Commerce showed today. The number of permits filed for future projects in January was upward revised to a 0.945 million pace from a 0.937 million reported earlier. Analysts had expected a smaller gain to a 0.960 million pace in February. The increase reflected a surge in applications for apartment-building construction. However, one-family building permits declined for a third consecutive month, reaching the weakest level in a year.

At the same time, housing starts declined at a 0.2% annualized rate to 0.907 million last month, after a revised up 0.909 million pace in the previous month. Analysts had predicted an increase to 0.910 million housing starts in February.

A separate report revealed that consumer prices in the US rose 0.1% in February, in line with analysts’ projections and matching January’s advance. Data also showed that more than 50% of the increase was due to higher food costs.

The Federal Reserve, which reduced monthly bond buying by $10 billion at the prior two meetings, will cut purchases by another $10 billion to $55 billion, and continue reductions at the same pace at every meeting before exiting the program at its Oct. 28-29 gathering, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Meanwhile, the 18-nation common currency was pressured after economic sentiment data for Germany and for the euro zone as a whole came in well-below expectations.

Economic sentiment in the largest euro area economy, Germany, deteriorated sharply, reaching a 7-month low in March, data by the ZEW Centre for Economic Research showed today.

The ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung), reported that its index of German economic sentiment slid by 9.1 basis points to reach 46.4 this month, the weakest level since August, from a reading of 55.7 in February. At the same time, analysts had expected a smaller drop by 2.7 basis points to 53.0 this month.

In addition, the euro area economic sentiment also registered a decline, coming in at 61.5 in March, down from 68.5 in the previous month and as analysts projected the index will decline to 67.3 this month.

Elsewhere, EUR/CAD touched a session low at 1.5332 at 12:51 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.5341, losing 0.3% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 13th low, 1.5310, while resistance was to be met at March 17th high, 1.5448.###2895||###2896||Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) announced that Steve Bennett has been terminated from his position as president and chief executive officer of the company today. The board of directors of the company appointed its member, Michael Brown to lead the company in an interim basis effective immediately.

The stock price of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) closed at $20.91 per share, up by more than 1%, but the shares of the company declined after hours. The shares of the company fell nearly 7% to $19.47 per share around 5:45 P.M. in New York.

According to the board of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC), a special committee with the assistance of leading executive search firm will immediate start looking for an executive who will serve as permanent CEO.

Daniel Schulman, chairman of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) said, “We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”



Finding the right leader a priority

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” added Schulman.

On the other hand Brown said, “With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company’s transformation plan.”

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with the executive team of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) to ensure an orderly transition of the company’s leadership while overseeing its ongoing transformation. He will remain a member of the board of directors, but will no longer serve on the compensation and leadership development committee and nominating governance committee.

Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) reaffirmed its previously announced targets of more than 5% organic revenue growth and better than 30% non-GAAP operating margin by 2017. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the company expects to deliver revenue in the range of $1.615 billion to $1.655 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings of around $0.40 to $0.42 per share. The company estimates its non-GAAP operating to be in the range of 24.5% to 26%.###2897||Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used-video-game market. It's a business dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores.

In an apparent swipe at GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point of saying the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 9 cents to $74.77.

But analysts said the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used-game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.###2898||Empty###2899||Computer security company Symantec has fired its second CEO in less than two years, with the dismissal of Steve Bennett in the wake of drooping revenue and falling shares.

Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as CEO in July 2012, with the goal of positioning Symantec to compete with a new generation of security companies, The Wall Street Journal reported.

However, Bennett had reportedly yet to deliver on new products.

"We weren’t making enough progress in product innovation," The Wall Street Journal reported a person close to the board as having said. "We were not seeing revenue growth."

Symantec has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO as it begins its search for a permanent CEO.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth," company chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Schulman also acknowledged the work Bennett has done for the company.

"We recognise Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," Schulman said.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5pc organic revenue growth and better-than 30pc non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

Symantec’s revenue sank 4.8pc to US$1.7bn in the period ended 27 December. Yesterday, the company said revenue in the current quarter would amount to US$1.62bn to US$1.66bn, down from US$1.75bn a year earlier. Shares fell nearly 7pc in after-hours trading yesterday. Previously, they were down nearly 15pc over the past 12 months.###2900||MOSCOW — Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin’s entourage.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin’s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 per cent in midday trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 per cent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank’s. They can also get cash directly inside their banks’ branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them,” according to the Interfax news agency.

Describing Rossiya, which was rumoured to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after

S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.###2901||"The rise of the East is often seen in the West as a threat, when it is in fact an enormous opportunity.

Several Russian banks on Friday saw their customers barred from using Visa and MasterCard credit cards as US economic sanctions over Russia's takeover of Crimea began to dig in.

US-based Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing the credit cards of customers at Russian banks due to the economic sanctions announced in Washington, the banks said Friday.

A Visa spokesman told ITAR-TASS news agency that the move was to "in order to comply with US law" and concerned four banks: Bank Rossiya, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and InvestKapitalBank.

US President Barack Obama on Thursday said a list of Russians targeted by sanctions had been extended to include billionaire businessmen bankers believed to be close to Putin.

One bank, Bank Rossiya, was also added, described as a "crony bank" for the elite.

Americans and American businesses, such as Visa and MasterCard, are forbidden from any dealings with anyone targeted by the sanctions and any assets they might have in the United States are frozen.

Clients of the banks on Friday found themselves unable to use their credit cards to make purchases or to withdraw money from cash machines not belonging to the banks.

Bank Rossiya said in a statement that Visa and MasterCard had "without warning stopped providing its payment services to the bank's clients."

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

Putin responded Friday by defiantly vowing to open an account at Bank Rossiya and have his salary transferred there.

SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, said in a statement that it believed the blocking of its customers' credit cards was "unlawful" because the sanctions targeted not the bank but its shareholders.

- 'Tens of thousands' affected -

None of the banks affected have a major high-street presence, but Bank Rossiya is used by companies within Gazprom energy giant to pay salaries to staff, the Interfax news agency reported.

"The main focus of Bank Rossiya is corporate clients... so this will not prompt public panic," said banking analyst Mikhail Kuzmin of Investcafe.ru.

"I don't think Bank Rossiya has many funds in the US, it's mainly businesses within Russia, they are not under any threat."

Kuzmin estimated to AFP that "tens of thousands" of people were affected at all the banks.

Bank Rossiya came 15th in a ranking of Russian banks by Interfax news agency last year in terms of the size of its assets.

Russia's Central Bank said in a statement on Bank Rossiya on Friday that "the operations that come under sanctions are not having a significant impact on the financial stability of the credit organisation".

"If necessary, suitable measures will be taken to support the credit organisation and give reliable protection of the interests of its account holders and creditors," the Central Bank added.

- A 'negative' effect -

So far the economic sanctions "will not affect Russian business as a whole," said Yevgeny Nadorshin, chief economist at AFK Sistema.

"These sanctions send a signal that the US did not stop at its first round (of sanctions). But it's a long way from a serious influence on the economy," he told AFP.

"If the sanctions limit the possibility of making payments to foreign agents, that would be very serious. Most Russian companies doing business with foreign partners make payments in dollars and have American accounts."

Fitch ratings agency on Friday lowered its outlook for Russia from stable to negative, a day after Standard & Poor's did the same.

That prompted an angry response from Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, who told Russian news agencies that the outlook was lowered "on orders, not objectively."

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the introduction of sanctions undoubtedly had a "negative" effect on perceptions and could lead to Russia "halting external borrowing and cutting part of its domestic borrowing," in comments to RIA Novosti news agency.###2903||Symantec said Thursday that it has terminated Steve Bennett as CEO and will replace him with Michael Brown, a director at the company, on an interim basis.

In a statement, Symantec said Bennett has also resigned from the board of directors. Brown joined Symantec's board after the merger with Veritas Software in July 2005. Brown had been CEO of Quantum.

The company noted that it will begin a search for a new CEO immediately. Symantec Chairman Daniel Schulman said the decision to swap out Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Nevertheless, Bennett was well along with Symantec's restructuring and refocusing. Symantec said that it still plans to meet its 5 percent annual growth revenue growth target by fiscal 2017 with non-GAAP operating margins topping 30 percent.

While it's unclear why Bennett was terminated, Symantec indicated that its guidance for the fourth quarter remained unchanged. Symantec sees fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents a share to 42 cents a share on revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion, down from $1.75 billion a year ago.

Today's Trending Ticker: Gamestop - Yahoo! Finance###2910||The stock market looked ready to finish off a turbulent week with solid gains, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 index was on track to close Friday at an all-time high.

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,882 as of 11: 30 a.m. Eastern time. If that gain holds through the close of trading, it would mark an all-time high for the index. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 119 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,451. The Nasdaq composite slipped three points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,316.

COMPARE, CONTRAST: It might sound surprising that the stock market is trading at an all-time high with all the uncertainty surrounding China’s slowing growth and simmering tensions between Russia and the West. But these concerns also highlight the relative health of the U.S. economy and stock market, said Dan Veru, chief investment officer of Palisade Capital Management in Fort Lee, N.J.

“In a perverse way, these geopolitical issues drive home the fact that the U.S. has been overlooked. The U.S. was the first major economy to go into recession, and it’s the first major country coming out of recession right now.”

COMING BACK: A week ago, the S&P 500 index turned in a 1.9 percent weekly loss, its worst slump in nearly two months. This week looks entirely different, with the S&P 500 on track to gain 2.1 percent, as concerns have eased over China’s slower economic growth.

The only stumble came Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve said it could start raising short-term interest rates as soon as next year. Traders drove down prices for gold, government bonds and stocks.

GOLDEN GATE’S TOUCH: News that Golden Gate Capital has acquired a stake in Ann Inc. shot the retailer’s stock up $5.20, or 15 percent, to $42.43. The private equity firm disclosed the 9.5 percent stake in the parent company of Ann Taylor and LOFT late Thursday.

SWOOSH: Nike fell after warning that a stronger U.S. dollar will dampen its results this quarter. Strong demand for its shoes and apparel ahead of the World Cup in June helped its beat expectations in the previous quarter, the company said late Thursday. Nike, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, lost $2.50, or 3 percent, to $76.77.

BOOTED: Symantec slumped $2.85, or 14 percent, to $18.08. The maker of security software abruptly fired its CEO late Thursday. It was the second time in less than two years that the company has dismissed its chief executive.

OVERSEAS: European indexes closed slightly higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.2 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent. Russia’s stock market sank 1.3 percent.

In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.2 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.7 percent. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

TREASURYS AND COMMODITIES: Prices for U.S. government bonds were little changed. The yield on the 10-year government was 2.77 percent. The price of crude oil rose $1.15 to $100.05 a barrel. Gold gained $5.60 to $1,336.10 an ounce.###2911||The Vermont Department of Labor says the state's unemployment rate for January was 4 percent, a drop of two-tenths of one percent from December.

The search in the Indian Ocean for the possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane has been called off due to bad weather.

Australian rescue officials, searching the `best lead` said that the operation will resume on Friday morning.

Menwhile, searchers flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean hunting for debris in “probably the best lead” so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.

05:53 pm:`Not hiding anything about MH370`

Malaysian consul general in India Mohamed Hatimi Abas categorically denied today that his government had hidden any fact about the missing Malaysian Airline aircraft, during his visit here, as per PTI report.

The site went black in Turkey late on Thursday, after Erdogan said in a speech that he intended to "wipe out" the service.

Twitter, a brief, 140-character format well suited to sharing links to information elsewhere online, had become a popular vehicle to spread audio recordings that appeared to incriminate Erdogan and other top government officials in corruption cases.

"A complete ban on social media platforms cannot be approved," President Abdullah Gul, a former ally of Erdogan who has become increasingly critical in recent months, wrote in one of five Twitter messages published during the blackout.

"I hope this implementation won't last long," he said in another Tweet. Gul has almost 4.5 million "followers" on the social media platform.

Above-average Turkish traffic

Twitter's own @support handle issued a message telling Turks how they could still write messages on the social media site using SMS "text" messages from their mobile phones. Meanwhile, cheat sheets in the Turkish language, explaining how to circumvent such bans more completely using Internet proxies and other workarounds, were distributed by members of the public in response.

According to the social media analysts at Brandwatch, more Twitter messages emanated from Turkey on Friday - in spite of the ban - than was the case on Wednesday before Erdogan's announcement.

Twitter boasts some 10 million Turkish users, with Turkish-language hash-tags regularly making the list of global trending topics. "#TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey" and "#TurkeyBlockedTwitter" both made the list on Friday.

Turkish voters will take part in local elections on March 30; the campaign has been impacted by the corruption allegations against the government.

The European Union commented critically on the attempted ban, after Erdogan had said he was "not interested" in the international reaction to his decision.

"The ban … raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards," EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Füle said in a statement. Turkey has long sought EU membership but is struggling with several outstanding hurdles to this target - not least the division of EU-member Cyprus.

msh/rc (AFP, Reuters)###2914||A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake - a total of more than 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

The coin will be announced as part of Chancellor Osborne's budget speech today.

The used game trade-ins commence next week in select Walmart stores across the US.

This will start from Wednesday the 26th March at 3,100 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores across the States and later down the road we can expect to see pre-owned games on the shelves, although titles traded-in next week for credit will not be accessible for re-sell immediately.

For those looking for additional help when it comes to trading unwanted games the official Walmart website has posted a video tutorial, although games are already available. In an article on Games Industry they discuss Walmart’s introduction to the game trade-in business as the company look to prise some of the action away from leading competitors.

We can probably expect to see the used and traded games available to in-store consumers as early as this summer, as Walmart intends to let the gamer pay less for their titles. This comes from executive vice president Duncan Mac Naughton as he comments about their expectations that will see Walmart pay more for games, while customers pay less.

The company expect to take on all games for all existing console systems and Mac Naughton says “trade-in prices will, of course, vary depending on a title’s popularity,” even though he does expect the average price paid per game to be around $35.

Therefore, we can see this becoming even more advantageous for gamers looking to exchange, trade or buy used games.###2919||Investing.com -

NZD/USD traded at 0.8608, down 0.12%, after New Zealand's fourth quarter current account balance narrowed to a deficit of NZ1.43 billion, from a deficit of NZ$4.88 billion and slightly above an expected NZ$1.41 billion, reflecting strong goods and services trade.



Overnight, the dollar traded mixed to higher against most major currencies on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin assured the world Moscow is not out to annex Ukraine, while expectations for the Federal Reserve to trim its monthly bond-buying program offset hit-or-miss U.S. housing indicators.



Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy.



Elsewhere, The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.



Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.



Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.



The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.



Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.



The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase..



U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.



The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.01% at 79.53.



On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is to announce its decision on interest rates and monetary policy followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen, her first as head of the monetary authority.###2920||Empty###2921||Newly analyzed satellite images of objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean have intensified the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in waters more than 1,500 miles southwest of Australia.

Malaysia's acting transport minister said Saturday that ships are heading to the location. One of the objects appears to be about 70 feet long and 40 feet wide, the BBC, Associated Press and Reuters reported.

"Chinese ships have been dispatched to the area," minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters.

It was a Chinese satellite that took the images. According to China's Xinhua News, the image showing the large object was taken on Tuesday (March 18), which means whatever was seen in the water may have sunk below the surface since then or drifted considerably.

The Indian Ocean is more than 3 miles deep in that area.

Flight 370 and the 239 people on board disappeared from radar screens on March 8 about one hour into its scheduled six-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Most of the plane's communications systems were either disabled or switched off around the time it disappeared. But investigators have followed some clues, including radar data, and believe the jet turned west, crossed the Malay Peninsula and then may have headed south over the Indian Ocean.

Earlier satellite images, taken about a week ago, also showed possible debris in the Indian Ocean about 1,500 miles southwest of Perth, Australia.

Those earlier images were the first possible sign of the missing Boeing 777. They led this week to a refocusing of the search. Aircraft and ships from Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and other nations have been crisscrossing the area. The effort is being led by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

So far, nothing has been spotted.

The newer images taken by the Chinese satellite show objects in the water about 75 miles southwest from where the earlier images spotted something, China's Xinhua News says.

Officials have cautioned that the objects seen in the satellite images may not be related to the missing jet. They might be, for instance, cargo containers that have fallen off ships.###2922||Empty###2923||Sterling is trading on the upside at around 1.3060 level after rising as high as 1.3085 earlier on Tuesday as the Brexit headlines suggest the Irish border backstop will eventually be sorted.

Among the individuals targeted with and travel bans and freezing of US assets are billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

The co-owners of SMP Bank and SGM Group, a major supplier of construction services to Russian gas giant Gazprom, were judo sparring partners with Mr Putin.

The pair - friends of Mr Putin since childhood - also made billions in Sochi Olympics-related contracts.

Financier Yuri Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya, is a personal banker for senior Russian officials - including, reportedly, Mr Putin. He is another close friend - and a neighbour - of the president.

They have known each other since the early 1990s when Mr Kovalchuk was deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

The bank - also on the hit list - serves some of the country's wealthiest officials and controls two big insurance firms - Sogas and SK Transneft.

High-level Kremlin officials including Mr Putin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov and deputy chief of staff Alexei Gromov are also targeted, as well as Vladimir Yakunin, chairman of the board of the Russian state-owned company Russian Railways and a close confidant of the president.

Gennady Timchenko, a prominent businessman and owner of the private investment group, Volga Group, which specialises in investments in energy, transport and infrastructure assets is also named by the US.

President Putin's spokesman said some of the names on the list caused "nothing but extreme bewilderment" - and Russia immediately responded with its own list of sanctions on American officials.

These included Obama aides Caroline Atkinson (deputy assistant and deputy national security adviser for international economics), Daniel Pfeiffer (senior adviser and assistant ), and Benjamin Rhodes (assistant and deputy national security adviser for strategic communications and speechwriting), as well as senators Mary Landrieu, John McCain and Daniel Coats.

Mr McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate, and Mr Putin have long been engaged in a bitter personal feud.

During their last war of words in September 2013, the US senator accused Mr Putin of corruption, repression and self-serving rule in an opinion piece for a Russian website in response to a letter Mr Putin wrote in The New York Times, urging America not to use military force in Syria.

In an opinion piece headlined "Russians Deserve Better Than Putin", Mr McCain also accused the president of being "a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed" for siding with Syria's President Bashar al Assad.

Back in December 2011, Mr Putin let his views be known on Mr McCain after the US politician tweeted "Dear Vlad, The #ArabSpring is coming to a neighbourhood near you" at a time of huge protests across Moscow.

When pressed about the tweet during a televised phone-in, the Russian president hit back, calling the senator "nuts".

"Mr McCain fought in Vietnam. I think he has enough blood of peaceful citizens on his hands. It must be impossible for him to live without these disgusting scenes anymore," he said.

Mr Putin added: "Mr McCain was captured and they kept him not just in prison, but in a pit for several years. Anyone [in his place] would go nuts."

Earlier this month, Speaker of the House John Boehner, also on the Russian list, called Mr Putin a "thug" over its actions in Crimea, according to The Enquirer.

The Republican told the Cincinnati newspaper it was "time to stand up to Putin", adding: "At what point do you say enough is enough? We are at that point."

He, and Senators Landrieu, McCain and Coats hailed their inclusion on the Russian list as a "badge of honour", while the White House refused to comment.###2927||Visa and MasterCard block Rotenberg’s bank operations

MOSCOW, March 21 (RAPSI) – Visa and MasterCard payment systems on Friday blocked operations with SMP Bank owned by Russian businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenbergs added to a list of targeted economic sanctions by the United States on Thursday, according to the bank’s statement.

On Thursday, the Rotenberg brothers were included in the economic sanctions list imposed against Russian officials over the Ukrainian developments. Arkady Rotenberg heads SMP Bank’s board of directors, and owns a 38% share. A similar share is owned by his brother Boris Rotendberg.

The new sanctions were in response to a vote held Thursday in Russia’s parliament ratifying the reunification of Crimea with Russia after 60 years as part of Ukraine. A referendum in the region held Sunday saw voters overwhelmingly support leaving Ukraine and joining Russia.

Along with Rotenberg brothers, who are presumed to have close ties with Vladimir Putin, the sacntions were imposed against Andrei Fursenko, presidential aide; Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office; Sergei Mironov, Duma lawmaker and leader of A Just Russia party; Sergey Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian State Duma; and businessman Gennady Timchenko.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this month that sanctions against Russia threatened to cause mutual damage in the modern, integrated global economy.

The US and EU announced asset freezes and travel bans targeting a number of Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin on Monday, following Crimea’s referendum.

Crimea, previously an autonomous republic within Ukraine, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government in Kiev that came to power amid often violent protests last month and sought reunification with Russia.###2928||Wal-Mart and other retailers are serving customers doing home improvement at the beginning of the spring season.(Photo : Reuters)

Gamers can exchange their video games for the worth any product in a Wal-Mart or Sam's Club location on site or on the internet beginning Wed. March 26

Wal-Mart will then prepare for store shelves at a discounted price than the amount it was originally bought for a press release on the company's website reported.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer at Wal-Mart in the United States said in a statement. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

According to the press release, games must be in the materials they came in, and brought to the electronics department in any Wal-Mart store,

Store employees will enter the game into their system, and check the product to see what wear and tear it has including deep scratches, or cracks the press release reported.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart said in a statement on the company's blog.

Wal-Mart will then give customers the amount the game is worth so they can use the funds on another product at Wal-Mart's over 3,100 locations throughout the United States.

The process applies for every game someone turns into the program, dubbed the video game trade-in program the press release reported.

Thousands of games compatible with Sony PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Xbox 360 are eligible for the program.###2929||Empty###2930||Empty###2931||China Unicom, one of China's three telecom giants, has joined the 4G parade. The company made it official with an announcement on Tuesday.[baidu.com]

Anti-corruption blogger, opposition candidate, and all-around Kremlin irritant Alexei Navalny is frequently accused by opponents of being a pawn of the U.S. government. After President Obama released a list yesterday of wealthy Russian insiders being sanctioned in the wake of the Crimea annexation, some Russians are joking that Navalny is really the one pulling the strings.

As Andrey Tselikov notes at Global Voices, Navalny wrote a post on his popular LiveJournal page on Wednesday asking readers who they thought should face sanctions over the Ukraine situation.

The leading vote-getters in the poll were a group of “biznesmeni” with close ties to Putin’s inner circle: Gennady Timchenko of the commodity trading firm Gunvor; construction magnates Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who may have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Winter Olympics; and Yuri Kovalchuk of Bank Rossiya, often referred to as the personal banker of Russia’s rulers.* Navalny also brought up these names in a New York Times op-ed the same day, titled, “How to Punish Putin.”

Navalny and his readers got their wish. The very next day, those four individuals, along with Kovalchuk’s company, Bank Rossiya, were the very ones the Treasury Department singled out for sanctions, for “materially assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation.”

Another name discussed in Navalny’s blog post, Russian Railways Chairman and close Putin associate Vladimir Yakunin, is also facing sanctions as a political official. Fifteen senior Russian officials were also sanctioned.

Given that the op-ed and the sanctions list appeared only a few hours apart, it doesn’t seem very likely that that Navalny’s suggestions actually influenced the policy. The coincidence mostly underlines the fact that these were the most obvious targets available. A Treasury spokesperson told Slate by email that Navalny’s suggestions hadn’t played a role in the decision and that the department had “fashioned these sanctions to impose costs on individuals who wield influence in the Russian government and those responsible for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine.”

It’s also worth noting that a few of the other recommendations for targets in Navalny’s Times piece—“the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively”—were notable by the absence from the final list.

But the overall strategy Navalny recommended in the Times, targeting Putin’s inner circle by “freezing the oligarchs’ financial assets and seizing their property,” is basically the one the White House has settled on.

Navalny, who was released pending appeal last summer amid widespread protests after being sentenced to five years in prison on seemingly trumped-up embezzlement charges, is currently under house arrest after being arrested at a rally in Moscow last month. His blog is also among the sites recently blocked on orders from Russia’s attorney general. All told, he’s probably pretty satisfied today, though.

London - Britain plans to replace its one-pound coin in 2017 with “the most secure coin in circulation in the world” as it cracks down on fake currency, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. The design of the current pound coin, which has been in circulation for more than 30 years, leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the Treasury said.

“The Royal Mint estimates that about three percent of all one-pound coins, or 45 million, are now forgeries. In some parts of the United Kingdom country, it is as high as six percent.”

The new two-coloured coin, designed to have 12 sides like the pre-decimal three-pence piece or “threepenny bit”, will be armed with the Royal Mint's new Integrated Secure Identification System (ISIS) technology.

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle, the Treasury said. - Reuters###2938||(Recasts with concerns about curbs in other countries, background)

SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s abrupt ban on Twitter Inc stirred concerns on Friday that the country may pull the plug on other social media and Internet services as it grapples with internal turmoil.

Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has in the past threatened to block Facebook Inc and Google Inc’s YouTube as well, though both remained online.

YouTube rejected requests by the Turkish government in recent weeks to block certain videos, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, citing anonymous sources. Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter’s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.

YouTube did not return requests for comment.

Twitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country’s government.

The ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.

For Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.

Analysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company’s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.

While Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey’s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“It’s a democracy, that’s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,” said York. “That could set a dangerous precedent.”

“I do think there’s a risk democracies could do this,” she added. “I don’t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site. I think instead what we’ll see is more pressure being put on Twitter to block certain content.”

Wall Street remains more focused on Twitter’s overall growth prospects and its budding advertising business, with Twitter’s stock finishing Friday’s regular trading session up 1.6 percent at $50.92 despite the situation in Turkey.

“If it does have any ripple effects, then obviously we would be concerned, but at this point I think it’s isolated,” said Arvind Bhatia of Stern, Agee & Leach.

But he noted that Twitter does have more political risk than other social media companies such as Facebook Inc, where messages tend to be shared among private groups rather than posted to the general public. Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.

Twitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.

A court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

The order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.

Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.

A Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.

Twitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

The clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter’s free-speech principles.

Because of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumors) can spread exponentially through “retweets,” Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.

Twitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.

The Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009. Twitter downplayed the likelihood of opening an office in the world’s largest Internet market, but the visit highlighted the tension between Twitter’s values and its business objectives.

The Mountain View company named board member Michael Brown to take over as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.

No reason was given for the termination of Bennett, who was hired to replace ousted CEO Enrique Salem in July 2012, in hopes of reviving the struggling company. Because Bennett, previously Intuit’s CEO, was widely regarded as moving the company in the right direction, his firing left some industry experts flabbergasted.

“It’s a shocker,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out. They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”

Before the announcement, Symantec’s shares rose 33 cents to $20.91 at the market’s official close. But after the company reported Bennett’s ouster, its stock price fell $1.56, more than 7 percent, in after-hours trading.

Matthew Casey, an analyst with Technology Business Research, also expressed surprise.

“It kind of caught me off guard,” he said. “I know the results of their recent quarters haven’t necessarily been the most flashy in terms of growth.” But he added that the changes Bennett was trying to bring about, which largely involved streamlining Symantec’s business, “were the correct changes that needed to be made.”

Best known for its popular Norton antivirus software, Symantec has struggled in recent years against a proliferation of other security companies, such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, in an effort to expand into the data storage business, also was widely criticized as a mistake.

In recent years, Symantec’s sales have been flat.

Last summer, Bennett cut about 1,000 jobs from Symantec’s workforce of about 20,000 and tried to find new product niches because slumping demand for personal computers had hurt its anti-virus sales. In recent months, it also has seen its chief technology offer and chief financial offer leave. But Symantec officials were vague about why Bennett was fired.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” the company said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”

The statement added that “our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

But that explanation failed to satisfy Rick Holland, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.

“This completely caught me by surprise,” he said. “I wonder what happened, for real. What’s the story that we’re not getting here?”

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit has being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

But the big question on many people's lips is: What about the supermarket trolleys?

Described as a 'giant leap into the future' the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit' which disappeared in 1971.

Five ways to tell your pound coin is fake

The original pound coin was issued in 1983 to replace the old pound note which was officially withdrawn from circulation in 1988.

Pound for pound: Some cash facts###2942||With Colorado legalizing marijuana for recreational use, making it legal to grow up to six plants for an individual, other states are looking at getting on the weed wagon. Many already are, decriminalizing possession of smaller amounts of pot, as well as legalization for medical purposes.

Sales in Colorado have been stellar, and the state is reaping the benefits, big time. In the first month alone, licensed dispensaries hit a whopping $14 million dollars in sales, and the state received a cool $2 million of those proceeds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year — about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

And then there is big tobacco, with companies seeing a serious decline in sales in the U.S., are forced to turn their markets to other countries, and pushing their deadly fares in China, Russia and India, to name a few. Smokers in the US have dropped to less than half of the people who smoked in the 1950’s. Smokers are becoming a thing of the past. It is a known fact that tobacco kills and as such, many states have banned smoking in any public buildings or structures.

With the popularity of tobacco declining, and the popularity of marijuana on the rise, following the medical marijuana legalization in 20 states and recreational legalization in Colorado and Washington, and at least 58 percent of Americans agreeing that it should be legalized, it appears pot already has replaced tobacco smoking in America, and the tobacco industry would be crazy not to get on board.

With all of this cash to be made from an alternative smoking product, why not? However, when the largest tobacco company in the U.S., Philip Morris, was asked the question about the future intentions of its company, spokesman Bill Phelps told CBS: “We have a practice of not commenting or speculating on future business. Adding, tobacco companies are in the business of manufacturing and marketing tobacco products.”

But one can rest assured, if governments continue to treat smoking as the public health menace it is, the tobacco industry may not have a future at all, at least in the U.S. And as marijuana popularity continues to grow, thereby inadvertently replacing tobacco products, it could save their imminent decline, so it makes perfect sense.

But there is another entity that could take the marijuana boom to a new level, and that is the liquor industry.

The Washington State Liquor Control Board is receiving plenty of applications from people who want to be certified to be able to grow pot legally, even though the agency is not yet soliciting such applications. The agency’s spokesman Brian Smith said Tuesday that some applications so far have come from people who have long been growing marijuana when it was against state law.

“We’re getting a lot of interest from people that want to be producers,” Smith said. “Some say they have been growing it illegally until now.”

Where pot will go commercially is still unknown, but it is bound to happen soon.

Because Wal-Mart sells such a wide range of products, you really can buy anything you’d like with the store credit. While you can also do this with the cash you get from GameStop, it does require leaving and heading to another store. Also, it remains to be seen if Wal-Mart’s credits will amount to more cash than GameStop generally offers. If so, they may be on to something.

Traded games will be refurbished by a third party company, and there will be a set process to how a game is exchanged. GameSpot detailed the process in their report, as can be seen below.

Here’s how Wal-Mart’s used-game program works:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

We’ll be sure to post more info as it develops. If I can trade my copy of Lords of Shadow 2 for some Blu-Rays and a bushel of Wal-Mart bananas, then sign me up.###2946||Empty###2947||Empty###2948||So, you thought the messaging mania would go away after Facebook bought What’sApp?

LOL.

There’s still more money – lots of it – flying around Silicon Valley aimed at those who text and send songs to each other. The latest jaw-dropping deal brings a $280 million funding round to Mountain View’s Tango. Tango is a messaging app, getting more sticky by the day as users play games and send photos and songs to each other. It’s got more than 200 million users worldwide to go with all that cash.

The funding round, led by China’s soon-to-IPO Alibaba (talk about a company about to come into some money…), will bring lots of growth to Tango.

Co-Founder Eric Setton, in an interview at company HQ, told NBC Bay Area “we're looking to make progress in terms of staffing...and add here in Mountain View as well as Beijing, China, where we have offices.”

International growth, for a company that has big growth plans.

But is all this money (for texting apps!) a sign of another bubble? Santa Clara University Business professor Robert Hendershott says maybe. Admitting that it’s crazy money flying around the Valley, he admits that this could also be a time for huge growth and innovation in tech, and that takes money. However, he says “when we start seeing Super Bowl commercials for texting apps, we’ll know we’re in a bubble.”

So, stay on the small screens, and we should be OK. As long as those millions and millions of people keep texting and buying.

Search continued in the southern Indian Ocean after sightings of debris believed to be from the plane.

In its latest update Sunday night after the conclusion of the day`s search operation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said there were no sightings of significance.

Search for missing Malaysia Airlines jet: As it happened on Sunday

"The search area experienced early sea fog particularly in the western areas, however, conditions improved during the day," it said.

A total of eight aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy`s HMAS Success supported Sunday`s search effort in a cumulative 59,000 sq km search area across two search areas within the Australian Search and Rescue Region southwest of Perth.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished mysteriously about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur March 8.

The Boeing 777-200ER was initially presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast in the South China Sea. The plane was scheduled to land in Beijing at 6.30 a.m. the same day. The 227 passengers on board included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians.

Contact with the plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1.40 a.m. when it was flying over the air traffic control area of Ho Chi Minh City.

The western boundary of the multinational current search area is around 2,500 km southwest of Perth.

Four civil ultra-long range jets chartered by AMSA and four military aircraft from Australia and the US were involved in Sunday`s search together with the HMAS Success.

Twenty State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers from Western Australia were tasked as air observers Sunday on board the civil aircraft.

"Each civil aircraft had five SES air observers on board, as well as an AeroRescue Aviation Mission Coordinator. Aerorescue is AMSA`s contracted provider of dedicated search and rescue services from locations across Australia," the AMSA said in its statement.

"The search will resume tomorrow. Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft and Japanese P-3C aircraft will join the search Monday."

Earlier Sunday, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss reiterated that the search would continue in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysian airliner as long as there was hope, Xinhua reported.

"We`re hopeful obviously for breakthroughs but these kinds of searches can take a very long time especially when they`re in remote locations as is the case in this instance," Truss said in a press conference at the AMSA here.

"We hope that soon there`ll be more information available that might help provide some kind of closure or at least an understanding of what`s happened, especially to the families of those who were on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370," said Truss.

"The search will continue and will continue as long as there`s hope, and I hope that we`ll find a time soon when we`re able to conclusively say once and for all that we are close to finding where this plane may now be located," he added.

John Young, AMSA general manager of emergency response, said searchers were Sunday hoping to find again the objects spotted by airborne observers the day before so they could be recovered and to find the objects identified in American and Chinese satellite photos.

"Today is really a visual search again and visual searches take some time. They can be difficult," Young said at the press conference.

Two Chinese Ilyushin 76 aircraft had been preparing for the operation on Sunday and would take part Monday, while Chinese warships were expected to arrive in the area Tuesday, said Young.

"China clearly has an intense interest in this search operation. I believe they had 154 people on board the aircraft," he said.

Mike Barton, chief of the AMSA Rescue Coordination Centre, said four civil and four military aircraft took part in Sunday`s search.

AMSA personnel were coordinating information gained from self-locating datum buoys with expert opinions from home and abroad to identify search areas, he told the press conference.

"We put all of that information together and any new intelligence that comes to us about satellites to formulate an area and we`ll redo it again tonight based on what observations might have occurred in today`s flying and look to go out searching again and then we`ll do it again and again until we have some sort of closure or positive sightings in the area," said Barton.

Observers Saturday identified a wooden pallet, some strapping belts of different colours and "other nondescript items", he said.

The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the airline industry, he said.

"The challenge of this search hinges around its remoteness from anywhere," said Barton.

The aircraft are operating at extreme ranges from Perth, which is the closest air field, or RAAF Base Pearce, which is up the road, and so at 2,500 km away they`re operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area, and then back again," he said.

"That`s only allowing us to get in a singular search a day which is again spreading the search out over several days."###2951||PERTH/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The search area for a missing Malaysian jetliner in remote seas off Australia was widened on Monday after French satellite images revealed potential “floating debris” several hundred kilometres north of pictures previously captured by U.S. and Chinese satellites.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the new lead in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was promising, but cautioned that the search in the icy southern Indian Ocean remained difficult.

“It’s a lot of water to look for just perhaps a tiny object,” Truss told ABC Radio. “Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and the forecast ahead is not that good so it’s going to be a challenge, but we will stick at it.”

Truss said the object spotted by a French satellite, which was reported to Malaysia on Sunday, was 850 km (528 miles) north of the current search areas for the Boeing 777 that vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board.

“That’s not in the area that had been identified as the most likely place where the aircraft had entered the sea,” Truss said.

Australia had used a U.S. satellite image of two floating objects to frame a search area some 2,500 km (1,430 miles) southwest of Perth.

Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing. Most of the passengers were Chinese.

A total of 10 planes, including Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 and Japanese P-3C aircraft joining the search for the first time, are due to sweep a 68,000 sq km area on Monday.

The crews are zeroing in on the areas around where the earlier sightings were made in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris, including a wooden pallet, spotted by a search plane on Saturday.

China said the object it had seen on the satellite image was 22 metres long (74ft) and 13 metres (43ft) wide.

It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same as those detected by Australia, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, said a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search.

The wing of a Boeing 777-200ER is approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base, according to estimates derived from publicly available scale drawings. Its fuselage is 63.7 metres long by 6.2 metres wide.

NASA INVOLVED

NASA said it would use high-resolution cameras aboard satellites and the International Space Station to look for possible crash sites in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. space agency is also mining archived images collected by instruments on its Terra and Aqua environmental satellites, said NASA spokesman Allard Beutel.

“Our satellites and space-based cameras are designed for long-term scientific data gathering and Earth observation. They’re really not meant to look for a missing aircraft, and obviously NASA isn’t a lead agency in this effort. But we’re trying to support the search, if possible,” Beutel said.

Truss said the aircraft flying on Monday would be focused on searching by sight, rather than radar, which can be tricky to use because of the high seas and wind in the area. Civil aircraft, which can carry more people, have joined the search.

Truss warned that the search could be hampered further by a cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.

“Clearly it won’t be cyclonic when it gets down into the southern waters where we are dealing with this search, but certainly it could stir up less favourable weather ... and looking visibly for debris or anything of interest is the best chance of success,” he said.

HIJACK OR SABOTAGE?

Investigators believe someone on the flight shut off the plane’s communications systems, and partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and re-crossing the Malay Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

That has led them to focus on hijacking or sabotage, but investigators have not ruled out technical problems. Faint electronic “pings” detected by a commercial satellite suggested it flew for another six hours or so, but could do no better than place its final signal on one of two vast arcs.

The lack of solid news has meant a prolonged and harrowing wait for families of the passengers, who have complained both in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur about the absence of information, many breaking down with grief.

A Malaysian statement said a “high-level” team briefed relatives in Beijing on Sunday in a meeting that lasted more than six hours.

While the southern arc is now the main focus of the search, Malaysia says efforts will continue in both corridors until confirmed debris is found.

“We still don’t even know for certain if the aircraft is in this area,” Truss said of the southern Indian Ocean search. “We’re just clutching at whatever little piece of information that comes along to try to find the place we can concentrate the efforts.”###2952||Please enable Javascript to watch this video

DENVER -- Two bills signed into law Monday aim to protect Colorado children from recreational marijuana.

"Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, before signing the bills into law. "Every neuroscientist I've talked to has talked about the possibility this could have long-term effects on a child's brain."

One proposal seeks to reduce the number of accidental ingestions of edible marijuana by young children who, for instance, confuse pot brownies for candy; and it also looks to limit the ability of older children to purchase recreational marijuana using a fake ID.

House Bill 1122, which requires all edible marijuana to be sold in opaque, child-proof packaging and also empowers pot retailers to confiscate suspected fake IDs like liquor store owners can, passed both the House and Senate unanimously.

"We had the marijuana industry, we had the medical profession, we had law enforcement, we had Republicans, we had Democrats all come together to say 'how can we fix these problems?'" said Rep. Daniel Kagan, D-Denver, the bill's House sponsor.

The proposal also specifies that marijuana that is grown in a home with people under 21 must be enclosed and locked.

"We have seen increased visits to the ER and urgent care clinics because kids are accidentally ingesting marijuana," said Sen. Linda Newell, D-Littleton, the senate sponsor.

"This new law goes a long way to ensuring that we’re taking steps to keep kids safe."

The new laws take effect immediately.###2953||Empty###2954||Foreign Correspondent

ISTANBUL // The decision by Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to block access to Twitter, triggered a rare public condemnation yesterday by the nation’s president, Abdullah Gul.

Mr Gul defiantly used the social-media site to criticise the restriction as unacceptable, in a development that highlighted a growing rift between two men who have shaped Turkish politics for more than a decade.

“If there have been crimes like the violation of people’s rights, only individual pages can be banned by court order,” Mr Gul said on Twitter. “I hope that this practice does not last long.”

The ban was ordered by the government’s internet agency on Thursday after what it said was a refusal by Twitter to block several tweets whose deletion had been ordered by Turkish courts. It came after Mr Erdogan said he would “rip out the roots” of the website at a campaign rally on Thursday for the March 30 municipal elections. Twitter is where leaks to recordings appeared that seemed to implicate him and other top officials in a corruption scandal, which has posed the most serious test to his 11 years in power.

The content of Mr Gul’s message – and the way it was delivered – was a message to Mr Erdogan’s religiously conservative government, observers said.

“This would certainly upset the prime minister,” said Mustafa Akyol, an author and newspaper columnist. “Disagreements are becoming harder to reconcile.”

Earlier this week, Mr Gul made the headlines by distancing himself from Mr Erdogan’s handling of a corruption scandal that has engulfed the government since last December.

Mr Erdogan has called the corruption allegations parts of a foreign plot against Turkey, but Mr Gul dismissed the prime minister’s statement as “worthy of a third world country”.

Mr Gul, 63, and Mr Erdogan, 60, both started their careers in an Islamist party later banned by the courts and are co-founders of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as well as long-time political allies.

Mr Gul served as the first AKP prime minister from late 2002 until March 2003, when he made room for Mr Erdogan and became foreign minister.

Mr Gul, who is seen as a more liberal politician than Mr Erdogan and a strong supporter of Turkey’s bid to join the European Union, was elected president in 2007 and remains highly respected within the AKP.

Analysts said Mr Gul wanted to make clear that he did not like the direction that the country was taking under Mr Erdogan.

“This is an effort to counterbalance the harm” done by the Twitter ban, Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Istanbul’s Bilgi University said. The political relationship between Mr Gul and Mr Erdogan was “slowly developing into a more open difference of opinions”.

Mr Turan said Mr Erdogan was running the risk of ruining his chances to become president in elections scheduled for August. “By his own actions, he may be disqualifying himself as a candidate”.

Some AKP ministers and members of parliament had displayed a marked “lack of spirit” in executing Mr Erdogan’s orders lately, Mr Turan said.

If the AKP was to do worse than expected in the March 30 elections, Mr Erdogan’s role as party leader could come into question, he said.

Most polls indicate the AKP, which has led the country through a massive economic boom and has pleased religiously conservative voters by ending a ban of the Islamic headscarf in state institutions, is likely to keep its position as Turkey’s strongest party with around 40 per cent of the vote in the upcoming elections.

But some polls suggest Mr Erdogan’s party could do badly in some big cities like Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.

Mr Akyol, the author, said Mr Erdogan remained popular with many conservative Turks despite the wave of protests after the Twitter ban.

“For the average Erdogan voter, the Twitter ban is not a problem,” he said.

The attempt to block to Twitter appeared to backfire with many tech-savvy users – besides Mr Gul – circumventing the ban.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors, the Associated Press reported.

The European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban – in a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.”

Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

foreign.desk@thenational.ae###2955||Zions Bancorporation (ZION) announced that, based upon an initial review of the Federal Reserve's publication, Zions' DFAST results were worse than Zions had projected. As a result of the Federal Reserve's stress tests, Zions will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

The company said it fell below the main capital threshold in the Federal Reserve's stress test because of greater real estate losses and risk-weighted assets, and lower revenue estimates.

The central bank determined the bank had significantly higher commercial real estate losses and Significantly greater risk-weighted assets. Regulators also found that the bank would have lower pretax, pre-provision net revenue under economic distress, according to the statement.

Zions also noted that its original submission to the Federal Reserve occurred prior to the sale of certain collateralized debt obligation securities in January and February 2014, which sales also resulted in a substantial reduction in risk.

Business News###2956||Empty###2957||MOSCOW, Russia — Russia's move to annex Crimea may have sent the patriotic masses here into a jubilant frenzy, but it’s left the small community of liberals and opposition activists wringing hands over worries about a future of growing isolation and authoritarianism.

“You hear this word ‘totalitarian’ when people share their anticipations about the future,” says Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “I would say there’s no disagreement that harder times are in store.”

Social media has been awash with expressions of gloom and shame. “People! What’s happened to our country?” Yuri Timofeyev, a photographer for the news website Grani.ru, wrote on Facebook after Russian troops invaded Ukraine’s Black Sea peninsula. “Fallen apart?”

President Vladimir Putin’s signature on Friday finalized Russia’s fast-track annexation of Crimea, condemned by most of the international community and punished by the West with sanctions against his inner circle.

The EU added 12 more Russian officials to its list shortly after, including the powerful deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and two Putin aides.

But on the home front, Putin’s confrontation with the West has earned him his highest ratings in years by playing to the conservative sentiments he’s cultivated since returning to the presidency two years ago.

Russians have been treated to a heavy-handed state-run media campaign of imperial nostalgia and historical revisionism aimed at portraying Crimea — which holds a special place in the collective imagination here — as Russia’s rightful property.

Almost 80 percent of respondents said they supported annexing Crimea in a survey conducted earlier this month by the independent pollster Levada Center.

The same poll found 58 percent backed sending Russian troops into Crimea and other regions of Ukraine, including the east, where unrest continues to simmer.

That’s unsettling Moscow’s chattering classes, which see a darker side to Putin’s ambitions.

He has “cynically raised nationalist fervor to a fever pitch; imperialist annexation is a strategic choice to bolster his regime’s survival,” Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition politician, wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday.

“Mobilizing the masses by distracting them from real problems like corruption and economic stagnation can take place only beneath the banner of fighting external enemies.”

Among those enemies are Ukraine’s fledgling post-revolutionary authorities, now scrambling to reassert control over a divided country in the wake of a protest movement partly spearheaded by nationalist groups painted here as “Fascists.”

Moscow’s campaign to win back Crimea has included appeals to locals there touting Russia’s political stability and brighter economic future.

Critics here in Moscow argue the Kremlin’s land-grab is being presented through rose-colored glasses.

Arkady Babchenko, a prominent Moscow journalist, echoed that view in a sardonic column titled “Welcome, Crimea!” in which he acquainted Crimeans with Russia’s stuffy state-controlled media, forced military conscription and crippling corruption.

“You will no longer choose — nothing, never,” he wrote in the magazine Snob. “Not even the colors of the curb in your courtyard.”

As the geopolitical drama unfolds in Ukraine, the independent media at home is being subjected to largely underreported crackdown.

Earlier this year, TV Rain — Russia’s only critical-minded television station — was dropped by major cable providers after it aired a poll asking viewers whether the Soviets should have surrendered St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad, during its brutal 900-day siege at the hands of Nazi Germany during World War II in order to save countless lives.

Kremlin-loyal bureaucrats lashed out over what they called an affront to historical memory.

On Thursday, reports suggested that TV Rain may be kicked out of its studios in a sprawling central Moscow complex that houses much of the remaining independent media.

Meanwhile, the well-respected editor of a major news website, Lenta.ru, was fired last week after her outlet published an interview with a leading Ukrainian nationalist whose militant right-wing group played a key role in the protests. Russian police have charged him in absentia with “extremism.”

The editor, Galina Timchenko, was replaced by a Kremlin-friendly journalist while much of the staff resigned in protest.

Lipman, the Carnegie researcher, says the independent media sector is “noticeably shrinking” thanks to such measures.

“For someone who has lost a job with a decent publication — by decent, I mean guided by professionalism and not a desire to please the Kremlin — there are fewer and fewer opportunities,” she says.

That’s part of a broader development of state-enforced patriotism aimed at breeding loyalty to the Kremlin, Lipman adds.

If there were any doubts, one need only look at Navalny, who was arrested last month and placed under house arrest for two months. His immensely popular blog — where he’s uncovered graft and lavish spending by the members of the country’s ruling class — was blocked last week after he criticized Russian policy in Crimea.

Perhaps most telling, however, has been the fate of Roman Romanenko, an otherwise unnoticed journalist in the Vologda Region— about 300 miles northeast of Moscow — who jokingly appealed to Putin send in troops to protect the Russian speakers in his region.

Moscow’s incursion into Crimea was launched under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking residents from an allegedly predatory government in Kyiv.

“Our sick are unable to obtain the medicine and treatment they need, the level of our education drops every year, children's after-school programs are being shut down, agriculture has been virtually destroyed,” Romanenko wrote on Facebook.

“We are suffering very much.”

The humor apparently didn’t register with the regional governor, who requested that Romanenko be investigated over his appeal.###2958||CLOSE

Designs on pushing Mulberry upmarket have received a setback with the resignation of its chief executive only two years after he was appointed.

The sudden exit of Bruno Guillon, coming after a string of profit warnings and a collapse in the designer’s share price, leaves Mulberry with two key positions vacant.

The Somerset-based company has been without a creative designer for six months and cancelled its show at London Fashion Week.

Investors reacted positively to Mr Guillon’s departure, however, and the shares closed 33½p, or 5.26 per cent, higher at 670p. Paddy Power, the bookmaker, has installed LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, as the favourite to buy the company this year.

Without directly addressing the Wall Street Journal story, in which sources partially blame Alta for the 10-month-old Citi Bike system’s financial woes, the Portland-based company explained that it has “grown tremendously” over the past four years.

“We are seeking outside investors to help continue to accelerate the growth of our company as we continue to improve service for our existing clients and expand our existing systems,” Alta’s e-mail statement said.

It's unclear if the company is seeking financial support for just Citi Bike or its entire bike-sharing division.



The company, run by former city of Portland bike planner Mia Birk, also said bike sharing in U.S. cities and around the world remains strong. Alta already runs eight bike-sharing programs in the U.S. and Australia.



“Bike share systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco are growing and expanding, with more users and more trips every year,” the company said.

However, the Wall Street Journal paints a troubling picture of Citi Bike frantically trying to raise tens of millions of dollars “to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money.”

The story says that Citi Bike “has been forced to contend with a number of costly issues.” Among them: superstorm Sandy beating up equipment, software bugs and a rough winter that discouraged ridership.

Bike share pricing Portland has yet to announce the pricing for its proposed bike-sharing system. Here's the pricing for Citi Bike in New York City. * $95-a-year membership (with unlimited 45-minute rides). * $25 for a seven days. * $9.99 for 24 hours.

At the same time, advocates told the Journal that Alta hadn't done enough to improve the system and has basically ignored problems as they popped up. The story cites Alta's failure to get the bikes where they need to be, problems loading new batteries into charging stations and layoffs hampering customer service.

Alta's bike-sharing system in Portland would have 75 stations with 750 bikes, mostly in Portland’s central city.



One thing that should give Portland officials pause: Tourists aren't using Citi Bike as much as New York City had hoped. And when they do, many reportedly can't even use their credit cards with the high-tech sharing stations.

An analysis by The Oregonian earlier this month showed Portland is counting heavily on tourists to keep the local bike-sharing system afloat when it launches.

The Portland Bureau of Transportation has not responded to The Oregonian’s request for comment.



However, in a text message, Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees the bureau, said Portland is being deliberate about starting bike sharing. One reason is "that it gives us a chance to learn from other cities, so we'll see what we can learn from what's happening in New York," Novick said.



"Part of the problem in New York was the software, and we are using different software that has gotten good reviews from the other cities that have it," Novick said. "I talked to Mia (Birk) and asked her about the tourist issue, and she doesn't think it's true that tourist usage in NYC has been way lower than expected; I asked her for numbers and she said she'd get them to me."

Earlier this month, a messy bankruptcy involving an equipment supplier prompted Portland to once again delay launching the system in Alta’s hometown until 2015.

Alta made only a passing reference to Citi Bike’s financial problems. Instead, the company’s statement to The Oregonian focused primarily on the system’s popularity and growth:

“New York's Citi Bike has proven particularly successful. (Seven hundred) people joined in the last week alone, even with near freezing temperatures in New York. Citi Bike currently has over 99,000 Annual Members and average daily ridership of over 36,000 trips per day during the summer and fall. We look forward to working with our partners at the City of New York to ensure the program to continues to be a success, and to expand this convenient, healthy and fun form of transportation for all New Yorkers.”

It requested that future questions be directed to the New York City Department of Transportation.

On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Alta shouldn't count on the nation's largest city to pour money into Citi Bike.

Unlike Portland, which is depending on government grant funding to cover half of its bike-sharing project's startup costs, New York was able to get Citi Bike up and running with corporate sponsorships from CitiBank and MasterCard.

Meanwhile, David Bragdon, the former Metro Council president who now works as an executive director of Transit Center, Inc. in New York, took to Twitter to defend bike-sharing, pointing out that the nation’s highway fund is about to go belly up.

According to a New York City bicyclist and bike shop worker named “Matthew,” who sent an email to The Oregonian on Friday morning, Portland bicycle businesses should also be concerned about Alta setting up its rental kiosks.



He asked that his last name not be published.



His email also pointed out what he saw as problems with Alta’s public relations:

It's rarely mentioned, but the effect on bike shops is nearly catastrophic. Most bike shops rely on repairs as their most profitable source of income. And the bike share has cut into that dramatically. I'm an avid cyclist from the NW, living in NYC, and I'm surprised they're doing so poorly. It has been a long winter but regularly I ride by these stations and there isn't a bike there. How can they be losing money? Didn't the city give them the space to park? If so, how bloated is the hierarchy? I've only commented on two news stories ever. Both bike share in NYC. And previously the NY Times ran an article pre-launch about the program and tips on bike safety. The first thing in the article was a "safety tip" that had an Alta Bike safety coordinator saying, "If a taxi window is down, listen for the receipt printing because it's a clue the door may open." So I called and emailed this crew about how negligent that tip is! Was their any accountability? No! Did they ever once go onto a NYC street and listen for a receipt? If they did, they'd realize how idiotic that tip is. Borderline gross negligence. When was the last time a printing receipt harmed anyone? Never! And with all the different safety checks a cyclist must make, why would you lead a NYTimes article with a tip that doesn't work in actual practice? Because these are a bunch of college educated theorists who are afraid to get their hands dirty and understand what truly works and what doesn't. Instead they have theories and bar graphs and pie charts that include listening for printing receipts. They are lucky no one has died trying to hear a receipt only to be hit by a vehicle. And it's sad that these people stay employed. If it was the private sector they'd be broke. Instead they are in some swank office answering emails and seeing how much social media traction they have. Meanwhile, their bike wheels spin aimlessly.

For what it’s worth.

"For all the concern there's been about the used video-game model as digital and online video games take share, Wal-Mart getting in validates the business model," said Oppenheimer retail analyst Brian Nagel.



"We aren't participating in the $2 billion used gaming opportunity at all right now," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters that announced the news.



According to NPD, video-game sales fell 17 percent during the most recent holiday season.

However, despite the decline, Wal-Mart said it still expects there was an inflection point in gaming with the new hardware that came out last fall, Mac Naughton said.

No doubt, Wal-Mart likely hopes the program will generate foot traffic, or help it capture a larger share of new-release game sales as those trade-in dollars are turned into sales.



But some observers said the bigger question may be the program's possible impact on competitors like GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, eBay and others that currently offer trade-in programs.

That's because the business can be lucrative. While the industry saw video-game sales fall over the holiday season, GameStop reported a 7 percent increase in used game sales for the period.

If the new video game trade-in program follows the example of Wal-Mart's current electronic trade-in programs, the value of the video game will be as competitive as the market allows.

Andrew O'Day takes it up a level.###2975||Empty###2976||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- TheStreet's Jim Cramer says Wal-Mart's (WMT) announcement that it would accept used video games as trade-ins, and the potential effect on GameStop (GME), has left him "cold" on hardware gaming. He prefers the digital plays, specifically Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO).

Cramer notes Take-Two is the cheapest in the group and says CEO Strauss Zelnick has done a "remarkable job" with the company.

Cramer does not care for Wal-Mart and GameStop, and he is still waiting for new additions to its video game inventory to recharge the latter. Instead, he likes the actual gaming companies over the retailers.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates ELECTRONIC ARTS INC as a "hold" with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate ELECTRONIC ARTS INC (EA) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income and disappointing return on equity."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:



Compared to its closing price of one year ago, EA's share price has jumped by 56.86%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Although EA had significant growth over the past year, our hold rating indicates that we do not recommend additional investment in this stock at the current time.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 88.70% to $685.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -0.21%.

ELECTRONIC ARTS INC has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC increased its bottom line by earning $0.32 versus $0.21 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.31 versus $0.32).

Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Software industry and the overall market, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.

The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Software industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 584.4% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$45.00 million to -$308.00 million.

Reuters

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, +2.09% TM, -0.04% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota’s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn’t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.

Director Michael Brown was named interim CEO while the Mountain View, California-based company seeks Bennett’s replacement. A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, Symantec said in a statement yesterday.

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem’s ouster in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record PC slump curbs spending on Symantec’s antivirus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock slumped 13 percent today, bringing the decline in the past year 25 percent. Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.

“It’s jaw-dropping,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. in New York who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. “Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”

Symantec shares fell to $18.25 at 10:08 a.m. in New York, the lowest since December 2012.

Executive Exits

Several top executives have left the company in recent months, including Francis deSouza, president of products and services, and James Beer, who had been chief financial officer since 2006 and left to become CFO of McKesson Corp.

Symantec remains committed to its target of revenue growth of more than 5 percent by fiscal 2017, Chairman Daniel Schulman said in the statement.

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth,” Schulman said. “This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

Bennett previously served as CEO of TurboTax software maker Intuit Inc., and before that as an executive vice president of General Electric Capital.

Slipping Performance

Symantec shares soared after Bennett’s appointment as CEO of Symantec, more than doubling in his first year on the job on investor optimism that he would deliver more consistent results.

One of Bennett’s first major actions was eliminating 1,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of staff, in an effort to bolster profit. The honeymoon ended as sales sputtered, top executives left and the PC market worsened, dragging down Symantec’s biggest business unit.

Sales in Symantec’s consumer division, which includes the Norton line of antivirus products, fell 2.8 percent to $2.17 billion in the nine months ended Dec. 27. Revenue in the data- backup division declined 2.6 percent to $1.9 billion in the same period.

The company still likely won’t be able to hit its targets without acquisitions or selling business units, in part because of declines in demand for PC security software, Joel Fishbein Jr., an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a research note.

Mobile Security

One area where Symantec has lagged its peers is security software for smartphones and tablets, a growing market that is dominated by companies including Lookout Inc., which has more than 50 million users and has raised more than $131 million from venture capital firms, and NQ Mobile, a Chinese company with more than 100 million active monthly users.

In recent interviews, Bennett declined to directly discuss the PC industry’s impact on Symantec. In January, he attributed weaker results largely to his overhaul of the sales force, which involved reassigning accounts and training employees to sell different products. He said the company was “making progress” and that the restructuring was complete.

“I’m very pleased with the numbers we’re delivering given the kind of transformation we’ve undergone,” he said in an interview at the time. “Even though we’re a little short on revenue, we’re delivering faster growth for the future.”

Symantec declined to make Bennett available because he’s no longer an employee. Bennett couldn’t be directly reached.

Kaiser Health News: My Experience With Obamacare, By Jen Sorensen

In a comic strip for Kaiser Health News, cartoonist Jen Sorenson details her experience attempting to get new health insurance (3/20). Check out her work.

The Wall Street Journal: Republicans Challenge Administration's Authority

Republicans are pointing to statements by a top Treasury Department official as evidence that the Obama administration overstepped its authority in delaying the health-care law's requirement that employers offer coverage or pay a penalty. Mark Mazur, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said in a January interview with staff from the GOP-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that he wasn't aware of any examination of the legal basis for the administration's authority to delay the employer mandate (Radnofsky, 3/19).

USA Today: Religious Challenge To Health Care Law Hits High Court

President Obama's health care law gets a return engagement at the Supreme Court next week in a case full of hot-button issues: religious freedom, corporate rights, federal regulation, abortion and contraception. Put another way, it's a case about God, money, power, sex -; and Obamacare (Wolf, 3/19).

Russian troops were rolling through Crimea when Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff and a foreign policy expert, was deployed on a mission to do media outreach. But the focus of Mr. McDonough's calls to local talk radio stations was not geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, it was health care. Mr. McDonough chatted with Andy Baskin and Jeff Phelps, hosts of a popular sports talk radio program on WKRK-FM (92.3) in Cleveland, about the coming N.F.L. draft, basketball at the White House and his days playing college football in Minnesota. Mr. McDonough then pitched a new website featuring games, videos and superstar athletes explaining the benefits of health insurance: a sports-themed portal to HealthCare.gov (Shear and Vega, 3/19).

The Washington Post's Wonkblog: Nebraska Rejects Compromise Effort To Expand Medicaid

Nebraska legislators spent the past year crafting a conservative version of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion that they hoped would gain support in a pretty red state. But after a failed vote in the state legislature Wednesday, the Medicaid expansion is officially dead in Nebraska this year. So far, 25 states and Washington, DC.., have expanded their Medicaid programs in 2014, the first year of Obamacare coverage. With some exceptions, these are mostly blue states that joined the expansion, which was made optional by the Supreme Court's 2012 decision on the health care law (Millman, 3/19).

The Associated Press/Washington Post: No Sign Of Movement On Medicaid Debate

There's still no sign of any compromise between Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican leaders in the House of Delegates over whether Virginia should accept federal Medicaid funds in order to expand health insurance coverage to as many as 400,000 low-income residents. McAuliffe, who wants to expand Medicaid eligibility, and House Republican leaders, who don't, said Wednesday that there had been no movement on the issue after meeting to discuss an upcoming special legislative session (3/19).

Los Angeles Times: Clinic Chain AltaMed Is Signing Up Latinos For Obamacare

The Wall Street Journal: Republican Strategists Split: Focus On 2014 Or 2016?

Some Republicans argue that with President Barack Obama's poll numbers sinking and his health-care law unpopular, the party is on course for big House and Senate gains this fall. The worst thing the party could do, they say, is to take up contentious matters such as an immigration overhaul or some social issues, which would divide the party and could prompt GOP voters to stay home. But others say the party has become too risk-averse. It needs to take steps now, they say, to reverse the party's losing record in the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections and start appealing to the more diverse electorate that will turn out for the 2016 election (Meckler and Reinhard, 3/19).

Republicans running for office this year are going to great efforts to show their opposition to the 2010 health-care overhaul.

The troubled exchange, which has filed for bankruptcy after a series of large thefts, had lost up to 850,000 bitcoins. This find brings the total down to 650,000.

“MtGox had certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins,” said MtGox chief executive Mark Karpeles in the bankruptcy filing, where the find was revealed.

However, “on March 7, 2014, MtGox confirmed that an old-format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 bitcoins,” he said.

The total number of bitcoins stolen equates to around 7% of all the bitcoins in existence.

Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement on the company’s website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching files that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed.

Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today’s rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million.

Plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the Bankruptcy Court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site.###2987||Tech Trader

Russell Crowe, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood are among the celebs to tweet their objections to the Turkish government’s crackdown on the social media messaging service.

“Turkey has banned Twitter? That is a terrible decision. I don’t understand it,” Crowe tweeted.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blocked access to Twitter and vowed to “eradicate” it after recordings implicating him in a bribery scandal flooded social media. Erdogan’s Twitter smackdown sparked outrage around the globe, with #TwitterisblockedinTurkey blowing up.

“Is Twitter genuinely blocked in Turkey? If so, this is shameful and scary,” tweeted Wood.

Meanwhile, Farrow spread news of a way around the ban: “Hey there friends in Turkey! You can stay on twitter via VPN and Hotspot.”

Erdogan, who is trying to quell the corruption scandal ahead of key local elections, blew off condemnation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other countries.

“The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,” he said.

Turkey’s Internet watchdog has blocked access to YouTube in the past, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which was used to spark government protests last year.

Some users have figured out how to circumvent the ban using the site’s SMS service. On Friday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan’s, was among those to defy the ban.###2990||Empty###2991||Empty###2992||Russian stocks take a nose dive as MasterCard and Visa stopped providing services to two of Russia’s largest banks on Thursday, including one which is said to serve as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation” Reuters reports. This means that Russian citizens will no longer be able to use their credit and debit cards branded with the Visa and MasterCard logo – including to withdraw cash at ATMs. Russian consumers t can still withdraw cash from the banks.

Bank Rossiya, Russia’s 15th largest, was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list following actions put in place by President Obama on Thursday in the wake of Russia’s actions in the Ukraine.

Putin joked that while he didn’t maintain an account at Bank Rossiya, he planned to open one. Russia’s central bank brushed off any implications that these actions would threaten the bank’s stability, but did suggest that Russian government would do what’s necessary to “support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors.”

Fitch, the ratings agency, warned that the consequences of Visa and MasterCard’s actions may force Russia’s already marginal credit rating (BBB) lower. These actions may impinge the interest of other countries to lend Russia money, potentially increasing its borrowing costs.

A flood of fake currency has prompted the Royal Mint to release a new "counterfeit-proof" £1 coin.

But how do you spot one?

There are estimated to be in excess of 30million fake pound coins in circulation.

It is illegal to use one and the Royal Mint says you must hand them in if you think you have been given one.

Depending on the quality of counterfeit, it can be difficult to tell the difference between a real and a fake £1 coin.

(Image: Royal Mint)

But there are a few key things to look out for:

1. The date and design on the reverse should match. It is changed each year and you can see a list of dates and designs here

2. Poor or missing lettering on the edge of the coin

3. The edge of the coin is uneven in depth

4. A coin which has been in circulation for some time but still looks shiny and golden and shows no sign of age

5. The colour does not match genuine coins

6. The Queen's head or reverse design look indistinct

7. Alignment - hold the coin with the Queen's head upright. Turn it over. The design on the other side should also be upright - fakes are often skewed

One coin expert believes although the number of fakes in circulation is increasing, they are getting worse.

"Quality is definitely dropping and fakes are now quite obvious, even to the untrained eye," Garry Day told the BBC.

"The workmanship isn't what it used to be and most are pretty easy to spot. People just need to know what they are looking for."###2994||"Sometimes you have to choose between two evils, and you choose the lesser of the two," Babacan says referring to blocking of Twitter access.

ANKARA - Blocking access to Twitter is not good for Turkey's international reputation, but doing nothing could have caused even worse repercussions, Turkey's Deputy PM Ali Babacan said Friday.

The most senior voice on economy in Turkey's ruling AK Party, Babacan told private broadcaster NTV that Turkey was left with no choice but do something to protect its people's rights of privacy.

"Sometimes you have to choose between two evils, and you choose the lesser of the two," he said referring to official telecommunications authority's decision to block access to the social media site.

He predicted that Twitter would not remain blocked in Turkey for too long and called for a solution to be reached reciprocally between Turkey and Twitter.

"There is a stark contrast between the fast progress of technology and the introduction of judicial frameworks to regulate and audit technology," Babacan said.

He noted that the decision was not a nice and agreeable one and added that sometimes this kind of ugly decisions need to be taken to protect people's rights.

Turkey's official telecommunications board TIB blocked access to Twitter on Thursday night, citing a handful of court orders as the basis for blocking its content.

Earlier, an omnibus bill introduced on February 28 made headlines in Turkey as it allowed TIB to block access to websites without prior court approval.

Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28th, suddenly a week later they find 200,000 of the missing 850,000 bitcoins in a “forgotten” wallet. Is it possible that the investigation was getting a bit too close for comfort? We can’t confirm that based on speculation, but there are many investors that have been suspicious of how Mt. Gox has handled several things.In an announcement posted on the Mt. Gox website today, Mark Karpeles confirmed that an old-format wallet used prior to June of 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 bitcoins. These bitcoins were discovered on March 7th, just one week after the filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo. Mt. Gox had originally stated that they lost nearly all of the 850,000 bitcoins. They blamed the loss on hacking, theft and software issues which resulted in the site being shut down. Karpeles also stated that he reported the discovery to lawyers on March 8th, and that the bitcoins were later moved to “offline” wallets for security reasons on March 14th & March 15th.Mt. Gox also filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on March 10th, and their debts are stated to be about $64 million.Today’s startling announcement ends with, “Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC. (Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation.)”While Mt.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia � Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.



The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.



SEE INTERACTIVE FEATURE HERE



Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.



One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia's southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.



"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.



Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia's capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."



News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.



"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.



But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."



Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don't have � the location of MH370."



Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."



Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).



Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.



"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.



The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.



Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."



Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.



The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.



The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.



Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.



But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.



Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.



Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.



Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association told The Associated Press.



"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.



The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.



Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.



Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.



The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.###3001||Empty###3002||GameStop’s (NYSE:GME) stock dropped more than 4% Tuesday morning on reports that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) would be announcing its foray into the used game trade business. The market is rife with rumors that Wal-Mart will start offering store credit to customers looking to trade in their old video games. [ ] Used game sales account for 30% of GameStop’s revenues and half of the company’s gross profit.

GameStop recently reported a 7% increase in used game sales during the holiday season, driven by strong demand for previous generation used-games. [ ] The company has successfully warded off competition from Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), which entered the used game domain in 2010, but it now faces a new threat from Wal-Mart. [ ]

GameStop is expected to report earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 later this month. [ ]

Can Wal-Mart Take Market Share From GameStop?

GameStop is the biggest video game retailer in the U.S., with more than half of the Xbox 360 and PS3 titles sold in the U.S. during the September quarter coming through the company’s stores. Wal-Mart also offers games and consoles at its stores but has so far been unable to take market share from GameStop.

Wal-Mart is well known for its low-price strategy and also offers a variety of items for shoppers, whereas GameStop offers just video games and consoles. Exchanging used games for store credit might be more lucrative for customers who are not just looking to trade in their old game for another game but can use the store credit to buy other items such as groceries or apparel. Electronics or entertainment items account for around 10% of Wal-Mart’s revenues, but it still has a market share of 15% in consumer electronics. On the other hand, Best Buy, which specializes in consumer electronics, has a market share of 22%. [ ]

However, GameStop has a loyal customer base, with over 31 million PowerUp Reward members. The company offers special deals and has built up good relations with its customers. For example, during the launch of Disney Infinity, GameStop offered customers the opportunity to pre-order over $400 worth of characters playable in the game. GameStop was also the only U.S. retailer to offer the exclusive $150 collector’s edition of Grand Theft Auto V. The loyalty of this base and the specialization in the niche video game market is GameStop’s biggest strong point, which might help it ward off the Wal-Mart threat.

Unlike Best Buy, GameStop has been relatively unfazed by the ‘showrooming’ phenomena, whereby customers go to a brick and mortar store to see a product and eventually buy from online retailers like Amazon and eBay. The company’s market share has remained largely unchanged for the last few years.

GameStop’s used game sales are highly correlated with new game sales, as the latter help replenish the company’s inventory; pre-owned game sales have consistently been around 65% of new software sales for the last four years. We expect the company to suffer a minor loss in market share, but it will still be able to gain as the new-console cycle progresses. We expect a 5% increase in used game sales through the coming years, but there is a 15% downside to our price estimate for GameStop should the growth be below 3% through the decade.

“Twitter, mwitter!” Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cried on Thursday. Rough translation: Twitter, schmitter! This was the last thing Erdogan said Thursday before the lights went out on Twitter near midnight. “We now have a court order,” declared Erdogan, who’s ensnared in a scandal inflamed by social media over recordings that purportedly reveal corruption in his administration. “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”

Oh, everyone’s witnessing it all right.

The funny thing about a global social-media platform, as some are starting to notice today, is that it’s not as easy as Erdogan might think to shut down by way of an order from a Turkish court.

Indeed, there are 12 million people online in Turkey, and quite a few of them – including some high-ranking government officials in the country – found it quite easy to tweak their domain settings and circumvent the Prime Minister’s effort to “eradicate” the communications tools.

Making matters worse, the pointless effort drew considerable international attention, all of it bad.

“The United States is deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world.”

Turkey, let’s not forget, is also under consideration for membership in the European Union, and stunts like these won’t help. “As a candidate country,” the British Foreign Office said, “it is important for Turkey to promote the E.U.’s core values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law.”

And perhaps most important of all is the reason Erdogan made the move in the first place.

When there are corruption allegations , and a government’s instinct is to address the charges by attacking the communications tools people are using to discuss the allegations, it’s time for officials to reevaluate their priorities.

Since December, when a corruption investigation ensnared government officials and businessmen, including the son of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, social media networks including Twitter and YouTube have become critical alternatives to traditional media outlets. A barrage of leaks of dozens of phone calls and documents posted by unidentified critics has presented Mr. Erdogan with perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office. Some of the leaks related to efforts by Mr. Erdogan to control the media in Turkey, where, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, 40 journalists were in jail in 2013. The prime minister was accused of making personal calls to media executives and seeking to have vocal critics fired. The government called the recordings fakes, although independent analysts said they were authentic. One recording purported to be of the prime minister telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly – and angrily – insisted that the recording was fake.###3004||You are the owner of this article.###3005||Empty###3006||You are the owner of this article.###3007||It’s like a scene straight from one of the video games it sells.

GameStop, the biggest seller of used video games, opened its doors Tuesday to find the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, was taking aim at one of its main lines of business.

Walmart said Tuesday it will step up its game and start offering store credit to customers who trade in used video games.

Scared by the upcoming battle, investors sent shares of Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop down 3.4 percent, to $38.39, Tuesday.

The used video-game business is a lucrative one, and GameStop likely has no intention of backing down.

“Our buy-sell-trade program creates a unique value proposition to our customers by providing our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products and mobile devices for store credits and apply those credits toward other merchandise, which in turn, increases sales,” the company said in its most recent 10K regulatory filing.

There are roughly 2.3 billion used games in circulation, GameStop estimates, so there is not likely to be a shortage any time soon.

It’s clear why customers like buying second-hand video games. The average price of a used video game is $19 at GameStop, compared with $41 for a new one, according to the company.

As of December 2012, the company had 3,100 different used video-game titles in its inventory throughout its 6,600 stores.

Roughly 27 percent, or $2.4 billion, of its total revenue of $8.9 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2013, came from used video games, the company said.###3008||Iowa’s unemployment rate went up slightly in January. Kerry Koonce crunches the numbers for Iowa Workforce Development. “Our rate was at 4.3-percent — it’s a tenth of a percent up from 4.2 in December. Part of that is due to benchmarking as the numbers change a little bit. But, compared to January 2013 — we were at five percent — so we are significantly below where we were a year ago,” Koonce says.

The benchmarking Koonce mentioned is the annual process where they bring all of last year’s monthly numbers up to date before figuring the new year numbers. Koonce says the numbers released each month sometimes don’t include all the information available. “Sometimes it’s a quarter later when all of the data comes in, January’s data, it can be April before we see everything. So we go back and true up those numbers to what the real information is from what employers report on their quarterly information and those kinds of things,” Koonce says. “And so you will see some changes in each month’s numbers of the previous year which overall can have an impact on what the annual rate is and those kinds of things.”

The numbers show the state lost 7,300 jobs from December to January. “The majority of that came in the trade, transportation and utilities area…most of it in retail trade. And what it looks like is the seasonable adjustment numbers maybe didn’t capture everything. So, we are expecting that maybe next month that’s going to kind of even back out,” according to Koonce.

Fifty-six-hundred of the lost jobs were in that trade, transportation and utilities sector. “We think that when the February numbers come out — and those will come out later this month — we will see where we are normally at this time of year,” Koonce says.

Regardless of how the numbers are adjusted, she says the overall picture is improving. “We’re almost a full percentage point below where we were this time last year. So that’s a significant improvement for our economy as we continue move forward,” Koonce says. “Plus, our unemployment claims continue to decrease, new claims continue to go down.” The January 2013 unemployment rate for the state was five percent.

The U.S. unemployment rate for January inched down to 6.6-percent from 6.7-percent in December. This was the lowest national rate since October 2008.###3009||Empty###3010||Hours after Twitter was officially blocked in Turkey, the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey went nuts across the world.

Tens of thousands of Twitter users posted photos, cartoons, memes and artworks to express outrage at the decision of Turkey's courts to shut down the popular microblogging site.

Despite the ban, over half a million tweets were posted in just 10 hours by Turkish Twitter users, according to a report from Twitturk.

A defiant Erdogan had vowed to "wipe out" Twitter and said he did not care about the international community's reaction.

"We now have a court order. We'll eradicate Twitter. I don't care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic," Erdoğan said at his campaign rally in the western city of Bursa on 20 March, ahead of key administrative elections.

"Twitter, mwitter!," Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!".

Earlier this month, Erdogan warned that his government could ban YouTube and Facebook. Last year during the Gezi Park anti-government protest, he called social media "the worst menace to society".

Turkey's main opposition party, the CHP (Republican People's Party) said it will file a legal challenge against the court decision to block access to Twitter. Deputy prime minister Ali Babacan said that the Twitter ban was done "out of necessity" and was a "choice between two evils". He added that he expected the block to be temporary.

More than 45% of Turkey's 80 million people use the Internet, and around 14% of them use Twitter.

The disruption sparked an online uproar, with many netizens comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.

Turkey's block is a simple DNS redirect, implemented by Turkey's local ISPs.

Turkish netizens have already found ways to circumvent the ban.

It is possible to use the social network without accessing the website. Here's a list of suggestions as provided by Syrian-Bulgarian blogger Ruslan Trad on his website:###3011||GameStop shares fell today more than 5 percent one day after Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, announced plans to enter the $2 billion used game market. Currently, GameStop shares are down 4.53 percent to $37.95.

Wal-Mart will begin accepting video game software (not hardware) trade-ins on March 26. The company plans to pay an average of $35 per title, though trade prices will of course vary on a game-by-game basis.

According to Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia, GameStop investors need not be worried about Wal-Mart's entrance into the market. Bhatia points out that Best Buy, Target, and Amazon have all tried to enter the used game market and none have had much success.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well. However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying 1 disc at a time from customers," Bhatia said.

GameStop's competitive advantages, according to Bhatia, include 1) owning and operating its own massive refurbishment center in Texas; 2) having pricing algorithms and experience developed over the past 10 years; 3) running its own Power-Up Reward membership program. Overall, Sterne Agee continues to rating GameStop as a "BUY."

Wal-Mart will not offer any kind of membership for its used game program, at least not at launch, executives for the company said yesterday during a conference call.###3012||This probably seemed like a good idea at the time.

* On campaign trail, Erdogan vows to “wipe out” Twitter

* President criticises complete closure of platform

* Regulator says ban follows court order

* Twitter says stands with users in Turkey (Recasts, adds Twitter comment)

By Nick Tattersall and Orhan Coskun

ANKARA, March 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections brought a furious reaction at home and abroad on Friday, with users of the social networking service denouncing the move as a “digital coup” and the president expressing his disapproval.

A court blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.

“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon,” the company said in a tweet.

A company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.

Tech-savvy Turks - President Abdullah Gul apparently among them - quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.

“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.

Turkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.

Twitter users called the move a “digital coup”, some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.

“Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations,” U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.

Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticise the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.

The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.

EUROPEAN VALUES?

Telecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.

“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and “cast doubt on Turkey’s stated commitment to European values and standards”. Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.

Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a “vital role to play in a modern democracy”.

Turkey’s financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.

Twitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. “We will wipe out all of these,” he said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is.”

Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure “does not derive from a prohibitive mentality” and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling.

Shareholders and consumers are applauding and taking notice in more ways than one.

Kellogg's is a pure-play food company with a 100-year plus legacy of maintaining integrity in the way it operates its business, serves its customers, and creates value for investors. I've been following the company for the past two years and the more I've learned about it the more I like it.

For shareholders and ethical investors looking for a publicly traded company that puts its conscience in synch with its corporate objectives, Kellogg's is one of the best. In fact, once again it's been recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, an independent research center promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance. In fact, Kellogg has been recognized six times.

One example: When Kellogg was hit by a shareholder proposal filed by the Green Century Equity Fund, the company decided to commit to only purchase deforestation-free palm oil by Dec. 31, 2015. Kellogg's uses palm oil in its snack food products and came under scrutiny over its joint venture with Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil trader with a high-profile track record of controversial environmental practices.

Lucia von Reusner, Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management, confirmed via email that "By raising the bar, Kellogg's palm oil commitment should encourage other companies to step up and support the development of transparent and responsible palm oil supply chains."

An investor who aims to be socially responsible finds this kind of ethical corporate effort encouraging. Like me, you can follow Kellogg's and monitor its sustainable and environmentally sensitive practices.

The other side of my enthusiasm for Kellogg's is it's business model and products. Not only is it the world's leading cereal company, it's also the second largest producer of cookies, crackers and savory snacks and a leading North American frozen foods company.

With 2013 sales of $14.8 billion and more than 1,600 food products it's little wonder that besides General Mills (GIS), Kellogg's is one of the most popular food stocks among investors. Average daily volume is about 2 million shares and its current market cap, according to Yahoo! Finance is $22.38 billion.###3020||Submit

London - Britain plans to replace its one-pound coin in 2017 with “the most secure coin in circulation in the world” as it cracks down on fake currency, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. The design of the current pound coin, which has been in circulation for more than 30 years, leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the Treasury said.

“The Royal Mint estimates that about three percent of all one-pound coins, or 45 million, are now forgeries. In some parts of the United Kingdom country, it is as high as six percent.”

The new two-coloured coin, designed to have 12 sides like the pre-decimal three-pence piece or “threepenny bit”, will be armed with the Royal Mint's new Integrated Secure Identification System (ISIS) technology.

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle, the Treasury said. - Reuters###3025||###3026||Empty###3027||Why did this happen?

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and he has grown international retail sales,” he said about Guillon. “I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

It was announced back in January that Mulberry’s profits were substantially low, bringing its share value down by a staggering 22%. Mulberry prices have increased significantly under Bruno Guillon as he tried to step away from “affordable luxury” and make the brand more upmarket.

We’ll keep you posted with more developments as and when we get them. What do you think the future holds for Mulberry?

Andrew O'Day takes it up a level.###3032||Empty###3033||BENTONVILLE, Ark., 2014-3-18 — /EPR Retail News/ — Walmart is giving the more than 110 million gamers across the U.S. a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and save even more when it comes to one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

How it Works

Walmart’s video game trade-in program is easy.

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.

Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year

Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned” which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.

Walmart’s Trade-In Continues to Grow In-Store and Online

Walmart’s in-store video game trade-in program builds on its existing trade-in offerings. In-store, customers can trade in tablets and smartphones and apply the trade-in value towards the purchase of a new device. Online at www.walmart.com/gadgetstogiftcards, customers can receive credit for a larger range of products such as MP3 players, cameras and laptops, in addition to smartphones, tablets and video games.

Around 3pc of all £1 coins, of 45 million in circulation, are now forgeries up from 1pc or 15 million a decade ago.

The figure had risen from 2.74pc to 3.04pc in the last survey alone, in November.

Most of us only discover we have one when we go to put them in a parking meter and find they are rejected, others are more obvious.

The pound coin, made from a mixture of copper, zinc and nickel, was introduced in April 1983 to replace the £1 note.

Fake coins are largely made of lead and then sprayed with gold paint. This means that the weight often feels different to genuine pound coins and the surfaces are notably different.

The Royal Mint warns of warning signs:

• The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.

• The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.

• The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.

• Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.

• The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.

• The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.

What do I do with a fake coin?

Vigilance in the first place is your only hope. You decline a fake pound when it's given to you. It is an offence to try and pass the coin on. In theory, they should be handed to the police.

Banks will not refund those left holding fakes. This can be very costly for small shopkeepers who take their till takings to branches.

Based on the 3pc prevalence of fakes, nearly all of us will be handling at least a few fakes each year, often without knowing.

How does our fake problem compare with elsewhere?

The 5 rand coin in 2004 was reissued after taxi-drivers and shopkeepers in South Africa started to refuse to accept them. Fakes were just 2 per cent of all coins.

Previous estimates of euro coins suggest they are far harder to counterfeit. Only 0.1pc of euros – some 10m – were fakes, according to research in 2006. Fakes are more prevalent among €2 coins, the European Commission said last year.

Why will the new £1 coin be better?

The Mint said the new 12-sided coins will be made from two different coloured metals – as yet to be decided – and contain an "iSIS security feature". This is to do with the Integrated Secure Identification System developed by the Mint. It applies this existing security technology "that has been proven over decades in banknotes" to coins for the first time. Those are the only details released. The coins will enter circulation in 2015.

EBIT margin target: 8 – 10% in Automotive segment

Group profit before tax also forecast to increase sharply

BMW Group can look ahead with confidence to the current financial year. Group profit before tax and sales volume are both expected to rise to new high levels.

“We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles”, stated Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG at the Annual Accounts Press Conference on Wednesday in Munich.

The planned growth in sales volume should also be reflected in group profit before tax (2013: € 7,913 million): “We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions”, continued Reithofer. The pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

Despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies, the Automotive segment will again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10% (2013: 9.4%). Tailwind will also come from the 16 new models and model revisions, which the BMW Group plans to launch in the current year.

Despite challenging conditions on international motorcycle markets, sales of the Motorcycles segment are forecast to be slightly up on the previous year (2013: 115,215 units), not least due to the contribution expected from the new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs (the R nineT, S 1000 R, R 1200 RT, R 1200 GS Adventure and K 1600 GTL Exclusive).

The Financial Services segment is expected to also remain on growth course in 2014. As a consequence of growth-related investments, the return on equity is likely to decrease slightly (2013: 20.2%), but still surpass the BMW Group’s minimum required level of 18%.

The forecasts for the current year are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

BMW Group posts record figures in 2013 for fourth successive year

The BMW Group continued to perform well during the past year within a challenging economic environment worldwide and successfully maintained its position as the world’s leading premium manufacturer. “We have recorded our highest ever sales volume and group profit figures for 2013 and achieved all the targets we set ourselves for the full year”, pointed out Reithofer.

Group revenues for 2013 totalled € 76,058 million (2012: € 76,848 million;

-1.0%) and were thus marginally down on the previous year, with the difference due to exchange rate developments. Group profit before tax (EBT) increased by 1.4% to a new high of € 7,913 million (2012: € 7,803 million) despite increased investment in new technologies, greater competition and higher personnel costs. Group net profit climbed by 4.5% to € 5,340 million (2012: € 5,111 million), also a new record figure for the BMW Group.

Capital expenditure increased year-on-year by 27.6% to € 6,687 million (2012: € 5,240 million), giving a capital expenditure ratio of 8.8%. The main focus in 2013 was on product investments for production start-ups (including the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer) and infrastructure-related investments to enable further growth.

Research and development expenditure rose by 21.3% to € 4,792 million (2012: € 3,952 million), as a result of which the research and development ratio climbed to 6.3% (2012: 5.1%). Important areas of investment were the renewal and expansion of the product range, alternative drive technologies, lightweight construction and connectivity for vehicles.

The BMW Group increased deliveries to customers by 6.4% to 1,963,798 units (2012: 1,845,186 units), with all three brands registering all-time highs.

Record dividend of €2.60 per share of common stock proposed

BMW AG is committed to sharing its success with its shareholders. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2014 that the dividend be increased to a new highest level of € 2.60 (2012: € 2.50) per share of common stock and € 2.62 (2012: € 2.52) per share of preferred stock. Based on these figures, the total distribution will rise to € 1,707 million (2012: € 1,640 million). The dividend rate is unchanged at 32.0% and is within the BMW Group’s target corridor of 30 to 40%.

Automotive segment: EBIT margin at 9.4% in 2013

Automotive segment revenues rose by 0.6% to € 70,629 million (2012: € 70,208). Influenced by the above-mentioned factors – high expenditure for new technologies, product range expansion and market launch costs as well as increased competition – EBIT decreased to € 6,657 million (2012: € 7,599 million; -12.4%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.4% and was thus in the upper half of the targeted corridor of between 8 and 10%. Segment profit before tax amounted to € 6,561 million (2012: € 7,170 million; -8.5%).

The BMW brand retained pole position in the premium segment in 2013, with worldwide sales up by 7.5% to 1,655,138 units (2012: 1,540,085 units). The BMW X1 as well as the BMW 3, 5, and 6 Series all asserted their positions as market leaders in their own segments.

Solid growth was recorded again for the BMW X1, with sales volume up by 9.2% to 161,353 units (2012: 147,776 units). The BMW X3 performed well again and recorded a 5.0% increase to 157,303 units (2012: 149,853 units). Sales of the BMW X5 were only slightly down on the previous year at 107,231 units (2012: 108,544 units; -1.2%) despite the model change (the new BMW X5 has been available since mid-November).

The BMW 3 Series remained a major source of growth in the past year, with sales rising by 23.0% to 500,332 units (2012: 406,752 units). The success story of the BMW 5 Series continued over the twelve-month period, during which 366,992 units were sold (2012: 359,016 units; +2.2%). The BMW 6 Series was also able to make significant progress, with sales up by 19.4% to 27,687 units (2012: 23,193 units).

MINI similarly set a new sales volume record in 2013, with worldwide sales edging up by 1.2% to 305,030 units (2012: 301,526 units). The new generation of the MINI will make its appearance in the showrooms from spring 2014 onwards. The MINI Hatch, at the end of its model life-cycle, still managed to achieve a sales volume of 128,498 units (2012: 131,569 units; -2.3%). Sales of the MINI Countryman were roughly at the previous year’s level, with a total of 101,897 units sold (2012: 102,271 units; -0.4%). In the period from its launch in mid-March to the end of 2013, the MINI Paceman achieved a sales volume of 14,687 units.

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars remained market leader in the ultra-luxury segment in 2013 and, with sales of 3,630 units (2012: 3,575 units; +1.5%), achieved a new sales volume record for the fourth year in succession.

The BMW Group recorded sales volume growth on nearly all continents in the past year. “The BMW Group’s sales strategy is geared towards achieving an evenly balanced distribution of worldwide sales across the three main regions of the world to avoid overdependence on any single market”, commented Reithofer.

At 859,546 units, sales in Europe – the BMW Group’s largest sales region – were almost at their previous year’s level despite challenging business conditions in some countries (-0.7%).

For the first time, the number of vehicles sold by the BMW Group in Asia exceeded the half-million mark. Sales in the region grew by 17.3% to 578,678 units, helped by a 19.7% rise on the Chinese mainland to 391,713 units.

The BMW Group continued to perform well in the Americas region, with deliveries to customers up by 9.0% to 463,822 units, including 376,636 units sold in the USA (+8.1%).

Motorcycles segment also sets new sales volume record

Sales volume, revenues and earnings of the Motorcycles segment rose in 2013. Revenues edged up by 0.9% to € 1,504 million (2012: € 1,490 million). EBIT rose to € 79 million (2012: € 9 million) and profit before tax to € 76 million (2012: € 6 million). Segment earnings in 2012 were impacted by expenses incurred in realigning the Motorcycles business. Despite challenging market conditions, a new sales volume record was set for 2013, with the number of BMW motorcycles delivered to customers reaching a new of level of 115,215 units (2012: 106,358 units; +8.3%).

Good progress made by Financial Services segment

The Financial Services segment continued to perform well during the past year. Revenuesincreased by 1.7% to € 19,874 million (2012: € 19,550 million). Profit before tax amounted to € 1,639 million (2012: € 1,561 million), 5.0% ahead of the previous year.

The number of new contracts within the credit financing and leasing lines of business grew worldwide by 9.7% to 1,471,385 contracts (2012: 1,341,296 contracts). The portfolio of lease and financing contracts in place with dealers and retail customers at 31 December 2013 climbed by 7.4% to a total of 4,130,002 contracts (2012: 3,846,364 contracts).

Workforce size increased – record number of apprentices

In 2013, the BMW Group trained more young people than ever before, employing a total of 4,445apprentices worldwide. Reithofer commented: “We consider training to be an investment in the future of the company and in society.

The size of the workforce increased by 4.2% in 2013, reflecting both dynamic growth in business volumes and the rapid pace of innovation. At the end of the reporting period, the BMW Group had a worldwide workforce of 110,351 employees (31 December 2012: 105,876 employees). The increase is due to the growing need for engineers and skilled workers in order to keep pace with continued strong demand on the one hand and to push ahead with innovations and develop new technologies on the other.

BMW Group in fourth quarter 2013

BMW Group revenues in the last quarter of 2013 totalled € 20,210 million and were thus marginally down on the previous year’s figure (2012: € 20,536 million; -1.6%). EBIT for the three-month period increased by 4.2% to € 1,951 million (2012: € 1,872 million), while profit before tax rose by 7.3% to € 1,889 million (2012: € 1,760 million). Profit after tax improved by 9.5% to € 1,306 million (2012: € 1,193 million). The total number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered to customers in the period from October to December grew by 3.5% to 527,620 units (2012: 509,684 units).

Automotive segment revenues in the fourth quarter were almost unchanged at € 19,325 million (2012: € 19,496 million; -0.9%). EBIT amounted to € 1,770 million (2012: € 2,054 million; -13.8%) and profit before tax to € 1,766 million (2012: € 1,899 million; -7.0%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.2%.

Fourth-quarter Motorcycles segment revenues totalled € 269 million (2012: € 274 million; -1.8%). The segment reports negative EBIT of € 14 million (2012: negative € 73 million) and a pre-tax lossof € 14 million (2014: loss of € 74 million).

Financial Services segment revenues increased by 0.5% in the final quarter of 2013 to € 4,992 million (2012: € 4,968 million). EBIT jumped by 25.5% to € 335 million (2012: € 267 million) andprofit before tax by 19.9% to € 325 million (2012: € 271 million).

A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”



Well, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!



This, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.



One can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.



Besides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.



The real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.



All those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”



The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.



What is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.###3039||Pandora is about to become more expensive, but barely.

The popular music streaming company announced changes to its Pandora One subscription plan, which allows users to listen to the content without having to deal with advertisements. The price for the subscription has been $3.99 but it will be going up to $4.99. To keep users from getting too upset, the company grandfathered existing active subscribers into the already-set price of $3.99. The incoming subscribers will have to cough up an extra dollar a month when it goes up to $4.99 in May.

In a blog post on the Pandora blog, the company elaborated upon the changes and justified the price increase.

"We've been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month," the Pandora blog post said. "Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015."

The company then touched base on the new policy that will allow existing active users to continue paying the same price, for now, while others will see a small price hike.

"In order to continue to provide an ad-free listening option, we are implementing some changes to the way we price Pandora One, including a modest price increase for new Pandora One subscriptions."

What do you think about Pandora? Do you think it is a better option than it would be if you purchased all of your songs on iTunes or elsewhere? Let us know what you think in the comments section located down below.###3040||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” the company said.

“It’s a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company’s turnaround. I view this as a major step back …,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5 percent organic growth and higher than 30 percent adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5 percent revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended December 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.

Symantec had been reorganizing its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

“Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list,” Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. (http://r.reuters.com/jur77v)

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

The Mountain View, California-based company’s shares closed at $20.90 on Thursday on the Nasdaq.

Law360, New York (March 19, 2014, 6:10 PM EDT) -- Carl Icahn and eBay Inc. traded barbs yet again on Wednesday, with Icahn first urging the company to sell 20 percent of its stake in PayPal Inc. in an initial public...

To view the full article, register now.###3042||Empty###3043||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — It’s no secret that Carl Icahn has had a vision of which way eBay Inc. should go with its PayPal electronics-payment business.

And on Wednesday, that vision got a little clearer. If your idea of perfect vision is 80/20, anyway.

That’s the view Icahn believes eBay EBAY, -0.77% should have with regards to PayPal. Specifically, he called for eBay to sell off 20% of PayPal in a public-stock offering and maintain an 80% ownership stake in the business. Icahn made his views known in what may be his longest screed since he began battling with eBay over PayPal, and certain members of the eBay board of directors several weeks ago.

“We believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal – and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses – will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,” Icahn wrote in his latest open letter to eBay shareholders. “The 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the “secret sauce” and “flywheels” would be preserved.

Icahn, who owns about 2% of eBay’s stock, gave what might as well be called his “seven points” for why he thinks it makes sense for eBay to spin off 20% of PayPal into a separate, publicly traded company. In a nutshell, Icahn said such a move:

1) Highlights value. “A separation of the businesses will allow investors and analysts to more clearly see the value” of what Icahn called PayPal’s sustainable double-digit growth and eBay’s strong free cash flow.

2) Focuses management teams. This has been a big one for Icahn, who has repeatedly said the “inexcusable incompetence” of eBay’s management has cost its shareholders billions of dollars.

3) Creates a valuable currency for acquisitions and attracting top talent. Icahn noted eBay’s recent $800 million purchase of Braintree in order to incorporate its payments processes with PayPal, but said PayPal’s stock would be “a more valuable currency” on its own for incorporating advantages in the payments business. Icahn went on to say that “PayPal employees will be more motivated when the company operates independently of eBay.”

4) Prevent dissynergies. Icahn hinted that PayPal, by being so tied to eBay, is unable to pursue potential strategic partnerships with the likes of Google Inc. GOOG, -1.67% and Facebook Inc. FB, -1.11%

5) Preserves current synergies. The main point here being Icahn’s belief that eBay and PayPal should have “a commercially advantageous long-term contract between the two companies.”

6) Extends PayPal product offerings. “We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace,” Icahn said, adding that the company has a “significant opportunity” to offer products such as check writing, direct deposits and interest on PayPal balances.

7) Allows for true “world-class” boards. Throw a dart and you can probably hit one of the many reasons Icahn is mad at eBay’s current board of directors, and members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook, in particular.

For its part, eBay has no plans to separate PayPal. Why should it? In 2013, PayPal accounted for $6.6 billion of eBay’s total $16 billion in sales. EBay has even set up a Web page to highlight why it thinks the two businesses are “better together.” Among the points eBay makes is that eBay is responsible for delivering 30% of PayPal’s new users and 50% of PayPal’s mobile volume.

And just before the market closed, eBay issued a statement of its own, saying “Being part of eBay Inc. for more than a decade has enabled PayPal’s strong growth and global leadership position in digital payments.” EBay added that since PayPal became part of the company, it has built relationships with the likes of Visa V, +0.01% MasterCard MA, +0.13% and Facebook FB, -1.11%

But will Icahn’s vision be clear enough to sway Wall Street, or eBay shareholders, in his favor?

“He says analysts can’t analyze the business properly, and a partial IPO would help,” said Gil Luria, who covers eBay for Wedbush Securities and has a buy rating and $70-a-share price target on eBay’s stock. “The truth is we know the revenue numbers and we have all we need to do our jobs.”



Luria admitted that Icahn’s ideas “could unlock some short-term value,” but over the long run, he thinks PayPal is more valuable with eBay.

“He certainly writes these things with an amount of humor,” said Gil Luria. “These points have been made in the past, so there’s nothing too surprising here.”

Surprising or not, neither eBay or Icahn are likely to adjust their vision of each other any time soon.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10 billion would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39 billion.###3045||Reuters

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit".

But Labour's Cathy Jamieson poured scorn on the announcement: "I think people are going to be worried about how many pounds they’ve got in their pocket, rather than the shape of it," she said.

The new one pound coin 1/ 4











Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

But many have already taken to Twitter to voice their scepticism surrounding the release of the new coin – with some speculating that it is a distraction as the Chancellor announces his Budget.###3048||You are the owner of this article.###3049||They are, like all of the leads in the quest to find a vanished Malaysia Airlines jetliner, uncertain sightings. An object photographed by a French satellite, and reported to searchers Sunday. And something that looked like a wooden pallet, surrounded by a cluster of other objects — including some that may be tie-down straps, spotted by a single search aircraft spotted.

As the search for the missing flight 370 passes two weeks, searchers have narrowed down the area where they believe the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board could have disappeared. Now, as numerous nations train their eyes on a broad rectangle in the south Indian Ocean, they are beginning to uncover traces of something that could — but is not yet with any certainty — related to the jet.

Still, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott spoke of the "increasing hope" that searchers will find something more tangible.

If it is a pallet, for example, that could prove a key finding, since wooden pallets are used in air shipping. It could also mean nothing, since pallets are also commonly used in marine shipping.

"So it's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain," said Mike Barton, Rescue Coordination Centre chief with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, speaking on Sunday afternoon.

Still, a second aircraft sent to double-check the possible pallet found nothing Saturday, as skilled searchers confront a vast and remote search area that is stretching the world's best aviation technology to its extreme limits. The difficulty in verifying sightings — U.S. and Chinese satellites have also both located objects of interest that have not been found back by aircraft or ships — only underscores the magnitude of the job at hand. Twenty-six nations are struggling to find a missing aircraft that may have crashed into waters 2,500 kilometres south-west of Australia, among the most remote places on earth, with currents that could move floating debris as much as 150 kilometres every five days.

Flight 370 disappeared in the early morning hours of last Saturday, after deviating from its intended flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Investigators believe it was deliberately diverted, and may have continued on for seven hours flying deep into the south Indian Ocean.

On Sunday, eight aircraft — four civilian, four military — took off to search a 59,000 square kilometre area, the size of Lake Huron. The civilian planes include two Bombardier Global Express, a Gulfstream 5 and an Airbus 319, which have been put into service for their ultra long range. Most of the flying time is spent winging to and from the spot search authorities believe the aircraft is most likely to be found.

The planes are "operating at the limits of their endurance, and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area," said Mr. Barton. "That's only allowing us to get in a singular search a day, which again is spreading the search out several days."

Chinese residents make up nearly two-thirds of the people aboard the plane. Their families have grown increasingly hostile toward search officials, particularly those from Malaysia who families have seen as obfuscating and creating unnecessary delays in locating relatives. On Saturday, a Beijing tense meeting between families and Malaysian officials ended early after emotions boiled over. The two sides met again Sunday, and the families set aside a time to pray.

"I am going to go crazy soon. I am very emotionally unstable," said a woman whose daughter was on board the plane, and who is now taking care of her grandchildren.

China has taken a significant role in the search, and has sent two Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft to Australia. Those planes are expected to begin flying to the search area Monday. China is also sending a cohort of warships and its icebreaker, the Xuelong; the first of those ships should begin to arrive in the area Tuesday.

More aircraft are being deployed in other areas farther north in the Indian Ocean, although significant attention is now being placed on the so-called "southern corridor," where the objects were spotted by satellites.

Weather has hampered efforts in that area, which is mid-way between Australia and Antarctica. On Sunday, searchers arrived to find sea fog and low cloud, although by afternoon that had begun to clear out. A Norwegian ship that had helped the search, the car carrier Hoegh St. Petersburg, left Saturday "in anticipation of bad weather coming through. She was worried about cargo damage, and had done three days worth of work," said John Young, general manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

The southern search area lies squarely inside the "Roaring 40s," a band of south latitude so-called by mariners because it produces fierce weather at the best of times, including winds that frequently approach gale force.

The vastness of the ocean is another complicating factor. Sun glint can obscure objects, and aircraft move so fast that "you only have to be off by a few 100 metres" to miss something, Mr. Barton said.

Still, searchers believe they are narrowing in, in part thanks to the hints provided by satellite images. "Today's search is about a visual search, a complete change of emphasis from earlier searching using radar," Mr. Barton said Sunday.

"We're into a more defined area based on the satellite imagery."###3050||Empty###3051||Empty###3052||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Symantec (SYMC) has shocked Wall Street, announcing the surprise exit of president and CEO Steve Bennett, marking its third CEO change in just over five years.

Shares are spiraling on the news. By midafternoon, the stock is down 12.3% to $18.33.

Trading volume of 43.7 million is more than six times its three-month daily average.

Bennett held the position since 2012 and led the charge in a turnaround plan which involved targets of more than 5% organic growth and over 30% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

The firm said Bennett's termination was a result of an ongoing deliberative process rather than any event or impropriety.

Until a permanent replacement has been found, board member Michael Brown will act as interim president and CEO.

Over the last few quarters, the company has struggled with declining PC sales dampening the take-up rate of its Norton antivirus software. Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec reiterated its fourth-quarter guidance of revenue between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion and adjusted earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters anticipate quarterly revenue of $1.644 billion and earnings of 42 cents a share.

TheStreet Ratings team rates SYMANTEC CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.

SYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).

The gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.

SYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.8%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.

The departure of Bruno Guillon, who joined the Somerset-based company from Hermes in 2012, comes two months after a major profits warning.

He will be replaced on an interim basis by former boss Godfrey Davis, who oversaw the rapid growth of the Mulberry brand between 2002 and 2012.

Mr Davis, who will revert back to his old role of executive chairman until a successor is found, said Mr Guillon had improved the quality of the Mulberry offering and increased its appeal in international markets.

He added: "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The company issued a profits warning within months of Mr Guillon's appointment in March 2012 and in June last year announced that creative director Emma Hill was to leave the luxury handbag maker.

Following her appointment in 2008, Ms Hill was credited with turning the firm from a trusted briefcase and wallet maker into an international fashion powerhouse with a clutch of celebrity fans.

The company's best known product of recent times has been the Alexa bag - inspired by style icon Alexa Chung - while its Del Rey bag was inspired by American artist Lana Del Rey.

Mr Guillon said last year that after three years of rapid growth he was laying the foundations for turning Mulberry into a global luxury brand.

He pointed out that with over 80% of sales derived from markets where the economic climate remains difficult, Mulberry's challenge was to accelerate its brand awareness in the United States and Asia.

However its recent warning left Mulberry on course for another year of falling profits, having slumped by more than a quarter in the 12 months to last March.

Mr Guillon was previously managing director of Hermes France, a position he held for four years. He joined Hermes in 2001, having previously worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci.

Additional reporting by agencies###3054||Used games are big business for video games stores and more general retailers including Amazon and Best Buy have also got in on the action due to the potential for profit. And now another well-known name is entering the field: Walmart.

Walmart will next week launch its Video Game Trade-In program as part of its Gamecenter offering in-store. But why would you choose to trade-in at Walmart over visiting a dedicated games retailer? Because Walmart will take your games in return for a gift card, meaning you can use the cash to purchase anything in-store, online, or at Sam’s Club.

While such an offer may not be too appealing for gamers looking to buy more games, it’s certainly going to be of interest to parents, or someone looking to offload their games collection with no intention of embracing next-gen consoles just yet.

Walmart also wants to attract gamers who desire more games, though, so it’s promising to pay more for your used games while offering to sell new and used games cheaper. If they can pay more than other retailers, then Walmart will certainly do well, but we’ll have to wait until the service officially launches on March 26 to see how much better their prices are.

Although Walmart intends to start buying used games from customers from Wednesday next week, it looks like we may be waiting a while to see them reappear for sale on store shelves. A “Certified Pre-Owned” collection of games is planned, but it won’t become available until the summer. If you’re wondering what the certification means, Walmart claims each game will be refurbished and sold “like-new.”###3055||Open enrollment for Obamacare ends on March 31 and in the race to meet its projected goals, the Obama administration is spending plenty of money to promote the presidents signature healthcare law.

That’s an average of $17 million a month on advertising, or $9 per signup if the administration reaches its revised enrollment goal of six million, The Daily Caller pointed out.

Which is still just a small percentage of the estimated $684 million that will be spent overall on publicity, marketing and advertising the Affordable Care Act, according to The Associated Press.

Look Inside!###3058||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Symantec's (SYMC) board has terminated Steve Bennett as president and CEO after less than two years at the software maker's helm, it announced after market close. The company has appointed Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

Shares of Symantec were off 6.72% to $19.50 in extended trading.

Bennett's departure comes just 20 months after he took the company's reins from Enrique Salem. The former Intuit (INTU) CEO vowed to breathe new life into Symantec, which had long been criticized for poor execution. Last January he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

In November, however, he acknowledged that he underestimated the impact of the massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his turnaround plan.

Symantec shares have fallen 14.83% over the last 12 months. In January, the company was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, which noted potential sales disruption from Symantec's transition.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman, in a statement released after market close. "These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," added Schulman.

Bennett also resigned from Symantec's board on Monday.

Brown joined Symantec's board in 2005 following the company's merger with Veritas. Previously, he was the CEO of Quantum corporation. "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan," said Brown, in the Symantec statement. "The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market."

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a "leading executive search firm," according to Symantec's statement.

Symantec also reiterated its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance after market close, forecasting revenue between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion in the same period last year. Excluding items, Symantec expects earnings between 40 and 42 cents a share, compared to 44 cents a share in the prior year's quarter.

Instead of flowing into storm drains and washing out to sea, an oversized tank harvested the precious resource to keep her thirsty citrus trees and vegetables from shriveling up on dry days.

Across Santa Monica, backyard rain barrels and cisterns are becoming fashionable. Since 2010, the beach city has doled out 385 rebates to homeowners who direct rainwater back into their gardens as part of a broader effort to become water independent that also includes cleaning up contaminated groundwater and recycling water.

“This is kind of a no-brainer, low-hanging fruit solution for anyone,” said Miller, who three years ago installed a 205-gallon water storage container, which resembles an upright accordion.

California is gripped by historic parched conditions that have desiccated farmland, dried up reservoirs and forced rural communities to ration water. A welcome dousing late last month did little to break the arid spell.

Even before this latest drought emergency, some agencies that historically draw their water from the overtapped Colorado River and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta have taken steps to slash their dependence on water from outside sources and boost their own supplies. Past drought woes, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, have forced some communities to rethink where their water comes from, and they”re increasingly realizing local sources are insurance against future dry weather.

Santa Monica, population 92,000, has perhaps the loftiest goal: to completely wean itself off outside water by 2020. The city long depended on its groundwater wells, but supplies became polluted in the mid-1990s from underground gasoline storage tank leaks and the addition of a fuel additive.

The contamination forced Santa Monica to buy most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a giant wholesaler that provides drinking water to nearly 19 million people in six counties. Meanwhile, the city used proceeds from settlements with oil companies responsible for the pollution to purge the wells. The cleanup, completed three years ago, allows the city to tap groundwater for up to 70 percent of its water needs.

About 50 miles to the northwest, the semi-agricultural community of Camarillo receives about 60 percent of its water from the State Water Project — a maze of dams, pipes and canals that carries snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and transports it to points south — that it blends with salty groundwater sources.

The Southern California port city of Long Beach, which relies on outside water for 40 percent of its drinking water, studied the possibility of building a desalination plant, which separates salt from ocean water. But it was too expensive, and the city is now focused on increasing groundwater supplies.

A recent amendment to a court order deciding groundwater rights would allow Long Beach to pump more water. It”s in the very early stages of drawing up a multimillion-dollar plan to build miles of pipelines to move the water.

While maximizing groundwater is key to cutting down on distant imports, which can be fickle depending on the weather, it”s not an option for every community.

Groundwater is “not available everywhere and it also depends on the quality,” said Jennifer Persike, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. “You have to be careful not to overpump it.”

While Santa Monica bets on groundwater, it”s also investing in other water conservation tactics, including recycling and rain harvesting. Near the touristy Santa Monica Pier, a water recycling plant treats excess irrigation and other urban runoff that is then used to water parks, school grounds and a cemetery.

The city also collects rain. The main library has a 200,000-gallon underground cistern that captures raindrops to water the gardens. Last year, officials installed a smaller cistern that will fill toilets at a newly built library scheduled to open next month.

Since 1997, the city code requires that new construction and remodeled homes must catch the first quarter inch of rain.

During a recent downpour in late February, Miller checked on her cistern, which she bought from a hardware store and installed by rerouting the downspout. She paid $571 for the tank, which is bolted to the side of her house for earthquake safety, and the city reimbursed her $250. As rain funneled from the roof into the beige cistern, water from neighboring houses coursed down the street like a river.

Though Miller”s yard consists mostly of cactus and succulents — she”s in the process of ripping up the last patch of grass — there are orange, lemon and kumquat trees, and a small vegetable bed of green beans, sweet peas and snap peas that need water. A full tank typically can last for months, allowing Miller to tend to her water-needy trees and vegetables on rainless days.

While rainwater capture does little to affect the water table, it does reduce potable water demand.

“I don”t think it”s as dramatic as buying an electric car, but if everyone in LA did it, imagine the water savings there would be,” she said.

Santa Monica officials estimate that rain harvesting, low-flow toilets and other conservation measures save the city about $326,000 per year. If the city becomes self-sufficient by 2020 as planned mainly by tapping groundwater, it is expected to save $3 million per year.

“Every drop counts,” water resources manager Gil Borboa said.

California”s drought has caught the attention of foreign leaders. During a recent three-day swing through California, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Gov. Jerry Brown that the semi-arid country has no water troubles because it emphasizes desalination, wastewater recycling, irrigation that uses less water than traditional sprinklers and other measures.

Kevin Wattier, Long Beach Water Department general manager, said incentives are important, but there”s no substitute for educating people to stop watering sidewalks.

“People need to quit wasting water. It”s that simple,” he said.###3060||This article is from the archive of our partner .

Retail goliath Walmart is going to start allowing customers to trade-in their used video games for re-sale, taking a big bite out of a major plank of GameStop's business.

GameStop is the largest chain of video game retailers in America, and while they sell both new consoles and the latest games, buying back and then selling pre-owned games has been a vital part of their revenue. Specifically, "used products represented nearly a quarter of its $2.1 billion in sales and more than 44% of gross profit in the quarter ended Nov. 2," The Wall Street Journal reported. That might be a bit surprising for anyone who might believe that $500 consoles like the PS4 and new games that cost at $60 (not counting add-ons) drove profits for video game stores.

For Walmart cashing in on $520 million (25% of GameStop's sales) might seem like chump change. But that they have bigger reach and more customers than GameStop, which mean they could make more money.

Of course, it's not just the re-sales of old games where Walmart will clean up. Customers will receive payment in gift cards up to $35 ... that they can use at Walmart. The new trade-in program begins next week.

For their part, GameStop doesn't seem worried. (Or at least isn't pretending to be.) "We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," GameStop's Chief Executive Paul Raines said.

Let’s face it, Steve Bennett was only at the helm for two years and only came up with his turnaround plan in January 2013. The company has also seen other top executives leave during the past couple months, including CFO James Beer and president of products, Francis deSouza.

If anything, the Symantec CEO position has been dicey over the years. Keep in mind that the board pushed out Enrique Salem just two years ago. And he only had the job for about three years.

As for now, the replacement for Steve Bennett will be Michael Brown, a board member and the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, who will hold the Symantec CEO position on an interim basis. SYMC will then begin a search for a permanent leader. However, the process could easily take months to complete. Again, this cannot be good for SYMC stock.

For example, the company faces intense competition. There is an onslaught of cutting-edge startups that are grabbing a bigger share of the security market. They are also taking advantage of the red-hot IPO market, as seen with the hugely successful deal of FireEye (FEYE).

SYMC stock has also suffered from the lack of a clear-cut mobile strategy. For the most part, the category is a rich target for security products. But SYMC’s efforts have been lackluster. Capitalizing on the void are scrappy startups like Lookout, which have raised substantial amounts of venture capital.

Yet the biggest challenge for SYMC stock is the secular decline the traditional PC business. Consider that a large amount of sales come from antivirus software and back-up systems for the desktop. The result is that growth has stalled. During the last nine months of 2013, net revenues fell by about 2%. Yes, that’s a grueling loss as the overall security market continues to show lots of momentum and remains a high priority for enterprises, especially in light of the high-profile breaches at companies like Target (TGT).

In other words, the new Symantec CEO will have a tough job ahead. And given the company’s track record, he or she will not have much time to show results for the turnaround. Unfortunately, this pressure may make things even tougher for SYMC stock as a new leader won’t have much leeway to try new things and focus on the long-term of the business.

In other words, maybe Steve Bennett should hope the Symantec CEO position remains an interim thing.

How Can the US Midterm Election Impact the Financial Markets?

With the US midterm elections just a few days away, it’s worth thinking about what they could mean for global markets. If the polls have it right, the Democrats will take the House quite comfortably, while the Senate will remain in the hands of Republicans.If that is the case, for###3065||NEW YORK — Walmart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Walmart plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Walmart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Walmart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In a wrinkle on GameStop’s program, Walmart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Walmart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits from the resale.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Walmart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Walmart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However … buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

London - British luxury handbag maker Mulberry on Thursday announced the departure of its chief executive, Frenchman Bruno Guillon, with immediate effect after two years at the helm. The company did not give a reason for the departure but it follows a profit warning from Mulberry in January following slowing sales in Britain and key market South Korea, sparking a collapse of its share price.

Mulberry said that Godfrey Davis, non-executive chairman and previously chief executive of the company, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Davis said in a short statement.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” he added.

The market for used video games is in the neighborhood of $2 billion. It's way beyond folks selling on Craigslist. Big global retailers, like GameStop, make massive profits selling used games. The gaming retailer's profit margin on used products is nearly 50 percent, far more than it makes selling new games and consoles.

Now the largest retailer of all, Wal-Mart, is getting into the market. It's offering store credit for old games, which it'll eventually refurbish and sell.

Other big retailers have tried and failed to shake GameStop’s hold on the lucrative used gaming market. Wal-Mart brings substantial market power and a formidable advertising budget to the table. But even if it doesn't beat GameStop, offering trade-ins will get more people inside Wal-Mart. The retailer is betting gamers will buy other things after they trade in their used games.

Selling used video games may be great for some retailers, but game makers are left out of the profits on the secondary market. Some have made moves to try to stifle the used game market or at least elbow in on the profits. But gaming companies have consistently backed down when gamers have pushed back.

...###3073||Pandora subs to rise as CTO steps down

By Andy Malt | Published on Wednesday 19 March 2014

US streaming platform Pandora has announced that it will increase the price of its ad-free premium service, blaming those pesky royalties it has to pay to music companies for the hike. From May, new Pandora One customers will pay $4.99 per month, though existing subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 for the time being.

A post on the Pandora blog sates: “We’ve been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month. Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015”.

As previously reported, in addition to the royalties Pandora pays the labels via SoundExchange, it has also been quibbling the monies it hands over to the music publishers via their collecting societies.

Last week Pandora won a court ruling in a dispute with one of those societies, ASCAP, which said it should pay 1.85% of annual revenue (Pandora wanted 1.7%) for the publishing rights, rather than the 3% the collecting society was asking for. Though the big music publishers are continuing to lobby for changes in US collective licensing rules, which would allow them to withdraw their digital rights from ASCAP and its counterpart BMI and negotiate direct with services like Pandora.

Elsewhere, Pandora’s Chief Technology Officer and EVP Of Product Tom Conrad is to step down in June, taking on a part time advisory role from July.

Announcing his departure, Graham said in a letter to Pandora staff: “Through all these years perhaps the most gratifying thing has been how the whole company has evolved. From the scrappy group that wrote those first lines of code to the dynamic and talented assemblage we have today, through it all we’ve benefitted from a group of men and woman that are without question the most talented, intelligent, thoughtful and hardworking team I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with”.

Former VP Of Engineering Chris Martin will replace Graham as Chief Technology Officer, while the company is also seeking to hire a Chief Product Officer externally. It has also bee announced that VP Of Technical Operations Steve Ginsberg is being promoted this week, moving into the role of Chief Information Officer.

Anti-corruption blogger, opposition candidate, and all-around Kremlin irritant Alexei Navalny is frequently accused by opponents of being a pawn of the U.S. government. After President Obama released a list yesterday of wealthy Russian insiders being sanctioned in the wake of the Crimea annexation, some Russians are joking that Navalny is really the one pulling the strings.

As Andrey Tselikov notes at Global Voices, Navalny wrote a post on his popular LiveJournal page on Wednesday asking readers who they thought should face sanctions over the Ukraine situation.

The leading vote-getters in the poll were a group of “biznesmeni” with close ties to Putin’s inner circle: Gennady Timchenko of the commodity trading firm Gunvor; construction magnates Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who may have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Winter Olympics; and Yuri Kovalchuk of Bank Rossiya, often referred to as the personal banker of Russia’s rulers.* Navalny also brought up these names in a New York Times op-ed the same day, titled, “How to Punish Putin.”

Navalny and his readers got their wish. The very next day, those four individuals, along with Kovalchuk’s company, Bank Rossiya, were the very ones the Treasury Department singled out for sanctions, for “materially assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation.”

Another name discussed in Navalny’s blog post, Russian Railways Chairman and close Putin associate Vladimir Yakunin, is also facing sanctions as a political official. Fifteen senior Russian officials were also sanctioned.

Given that the op-ed and the sanctions list appeared only a few hours apart, it doesn’t seem very likely that that Navalny’s suggestions actually influenced the policy. The coincidence mostly underlines the fact that these were the most obvious targets available. A Treasury spokesperson told Slate by email that Navalny’s suggestions hadn’t played a role in the decision and that the department had “fashioned these sanctions to impose costs on individuals who wield influence in the Russian government and those responsible for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine.”

It’s also worth noting that a few of the other recommendations for targets in Navalny’s Times piece—“the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively”—were notable by the absence from the final list.

But the overall strategy Navalny recommended in the Times, targeting Putin’s inner circle by “freezing the oligarchs’ financial assets and seizing their property,” is basically the one the White House has settled on.

Navalny, who was released pending appeal last summer amid widespread protests after being sentenced to five years in prison on seemingly trumped-up embezzlement charges, is currently under house arrest after being arrested at a rally in Moscow last month. His blog is also among the sites recently blocked on orders from Russia’s attorney general. All told, he’s probably pretty satisfied today, though.

Walmart is looking to stomp on competitor GameStop by kicking off a game trade-in program on March 26. Later this year the retailing giant will start selling pre-owned games.

GameStop's long-running program of accepting trade-in games for cash or in-store credit will be replicated by the nation's largest retail chain. Walmart and Sam's Club will allow customers to trade in games for Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 and immediately apply that value to any new purchase both in store or online, the company said.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Those interested in trading in their games will bring them to the store's electronics' department with the original case. An associate will then scan the game's bar code and evaluate the overall condition of the game. The customer will then be offered a trade-in value that can be accepted or denied. If accepted, the amount immediately becomes available to the customer for use in a future purchase.

Walmart said trade-in prices will range up to $35 per game. The program only includes games, not the hardware.

This program, obviously, will lead to Walmart starting to sell certified pre-owned video games later this year. These will be sold both online and in store. The company promises that these used games will be refurbished and in "like new" condition.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," added Mac Naughton.

Walmart already accepts trade-ins for tablets and smartphones.

The importance of the gaming market was clearly made yesterday as the research firm GFK Chart Trak reported that Titanfall from Electronic Arts landed in the top spot on the UK gaming charts. In addition, GFK credited the game with a 96 percent increase in UK Xbox One sales. Of these purchases, 70 percent took place through the TitanFall/Xbox One bundle that was offered.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###3082||A flawed reform of America's housing-finance market.

A rare area of agreement about the financial crisis of 2008 is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the core of the meltdown and are in urgent need of reform. On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.

The plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress. Yet neither of these assumptions, on deeper examination, seems to be true.

To satisfy those who want low-priced mortgages on terms that private markets would never endorse, the plan makes explicit the government guarantee on debt which had been implicit for Fannie and Freddie. This would lower the interest rate on high-risk loans, while obscuring the cost of the subsidy.

To placate those who worry that this in turn would leave the government stuck with mountains of dud loans, a 10% capital cushion must be provided by investors to absorb initial losses.

A fee of 0.1% would be charged on all mortgage-backed bonds, with the proceeds going to three funds, two pre-existing, that will provide subsidies for housing. An as-yet undetermined insurance charge will be levied on top. The result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, "would be a strong step forward" to fixing "our flawed housing system".

If only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie. The first objection is that the law would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with a regulator atop other entities devoted to overseeing functions such as syndicating loans or bundling the loans of small banks.

When the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first. Then they tanked--presumably because investors reached page 387 of the 442-page text and found enshrined in legislation an earlier 2012 order by the Treasury that expropriated from private investors all profits made by Fannie and Freddie.

The move is unlikely to help attract the private money needed to supply the 10% in equity underpinning bonds issued under the new plan.

Opponents of Fannie and Freddie contend that the two played a key role in the crisis by encouraging the issuance of loans with tiny down payments through a benign-sounding "affordable housing" mandate. Nothing much has changed. Under the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.

Strewn through the proposed law are words such as "affordable", "equal access" and "underserved communities", which suggest that lending decisions will be based on political rather than credit criteria. "The result", says Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, "will be risky lending for those least able to cope."

The underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups. A better approach would be to handle these goals separately and explicitly.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don’t illegally access marijuana.

“Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids,” Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the Legislature.

“Everyone came together on this,” said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

A pediatric emergency room physician from Children’s Hospital Colorado, Dr. George Sam Wang, joined the bill signing and said there’s anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said that there’s not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

“We’ve only been experiencing this for a couple years,” Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.

Asked whether the marijuana industry needs additional curbs — including a possible potency limit or new limits on edible pot — Hickenlooper said it was too soon to advocate for more sweeping changes.

“This is brand-new territory,” Hickenlooper said.

Some lawmakers have said they want to propose curbs on edible pot, but no such bill has yet been introduced.

Legislators planned to meet Monday afternoon with marijuana industry lobbyists to discuss pot taxes. The first $40 million from pot excise taxes is devoted to education, but lawmakers will decide how to spend any additional tax revenue.

A new 12-sided pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled – and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a “giant leap into the future” the new coin will replace a familiar token that the Treasury says has a 3% forgery rate – amounting to a total of more than 45m in circulation.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the “threepenny bit”, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor the new coin – which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 – will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a “bimetallic” construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint’s headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.



A Treasury spokesman said: “After 30 years’ loyal service the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.



“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

“We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit.”



The Royal Mint chief executive, Adam Lawrence, hailed the “exciting project”, adding: “The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.



“It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK’s currency in the process.



“We’re extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint’s Integrated Secure Identification System (iSis) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.”



As with all British coins the Queen’s effigy will be on the “heads” side, while the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the “tails” side.



A Bank of England spokesman said: “Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”



National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: “The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.”###3088||Empty###3089||Empty###3090||Further updated France has used a space based radar system to pierce the clouds frustrating the Australian coordinated search for flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean and found evidence of substantial debris which may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines 777.

Further updated

France has used a space based radar system to pierce the clouds frustrating the Australian coordinated search for flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean and found evidence of substantial debris which may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines 777.

In an interview carried on the US ABC network and a Kuala Lumpur news site French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal says the seldom discussed satellite radar system “identified some debris that could be from the Malaysian Airlines plane”.

He said the radar echoes, which can be converted into black-and-white images, do not have the same “definition like a photograph, but they do allow us to identify the nature of an object and to localize it.”

Such space based radar sounding systems are rarely acknowledged by the world’s space powers in public discussions, with their capabilities and technologies referred to in little more than generalities.

However France’s use of the space radar, and its sharing of the southern ocean data with the MH370 search effort, brings an important new capability to bear in the zone between 2300-2600 kilometres SW of Perth where a range of objects which may be from the lost Boeing 777-200ER are being sought.

These include briefly glimpsed coloured restraining tapes floating in the vicinity of a wooden pallet which may have been used to secure cargo loaded in the belly of the Malaysia Airlines flight. Flight MH370 had 239 people on board when it took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on 8 March, only to disappear from air traffic control radar 42 minutes after departure.

Satellite radar soundings could penetrate the bad visibility that frustrated yesterday’s attempts by aircraft and ships to locate one or perhaps more large objects already seen at optical wavelengths by an American and a Chinese satellite on 16 March and 18 March respectively.

A late night update issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority says nothing new was found by air or sea in the search area yesterday Sunday, which despite earlier hopes for improved visibility, saw viewing conditions deteriorate and frustrate searchers. The statement didn’t refer to the new French satellite data which the authorities in KL said was sent to AMSA yesterday. There would be a very good reason for not referring to it should it involve disclosures about sensitive space systems capabilities.

Today’s search activities will have additional aircraft from China and Japan available for the first time, and the targets for aircraft and vessels will be refined using data from buoys dropped yesterday and the previous day to give real time information on wind and ocean current and wave conditions.

Update

In a radio interview this morning the Transport and Infrastructure Minister Warren Truss confirmed French reports that the objects identified by space radar are some 800 kilometres or so north of the areas where US and China satellite images found a large object last week, and where transient sightings were made in bad visibility of a wooden pallet and some cargo straps over the weekend.

This is because the review process – and quite specifically the stress test conducted as a part of it – is an important tool in the financial regulator’s arsenal to ensure that the country’s financial system can withstand an extreme adverse economic scenario in the future. As these tests aim to gauge the strength of each of the country’s largest financial institutions under conditions similar to those seen during the economic downturn of 2008, they help the Fed advise individual firms about how much they need to shore up their balance sheet if necessary.

Summary results for the fourth iteration of the stress test were released by the Fed Thursday, March 20, and although the process involved 12 more financial institutions compared to last year, there was a clear improvement in overall capital conditions across the industry. [ ] All but one of the firms (Zions Bancorporation) cleared the tests.

In this article, which is the first in our series on the Fed’s stress tests and its implications for the biggest banks reviewed, we simplify the key points to put these tests in perspective and also summarize the results to help understand how the firms fare with respect to each other.

See Full Analysis for: Bank of America | Goldman Sachs | JPMorgan Chase | Morgan Stanley | Citigroup

Understanding The Test Scenario

The purpose of the stress test is to ensure that the banks have enough capital to lend to customers and businesses even under extremely trying economic conditions. The test scenario includes 28 variables (increased from 26 last year) that capture various aspects of the global economy. [ ] Of these, 16 variables relate to the domestic economy and the rest are international variables.

The main domestic variables considered as part of the supervisory scenario for the stress test are:

The U.S. unemployment rate reaches a peak of 11.25%. This figure has hovered around 6.7% over the last three months.

Equity prices witness a 50% drop compared to their value in Q3 2013.

Housing prices dip 25% by mid-2015, represented by a reduction in the house price index. The index has shown healthy quarter-on-quarter growth since early 2012.

The 12 international variables capture the impact of a fall in real GDP growth, inflation, and the U.S./foreign currency exchange rate for the four country/region blocks of the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, developing Asia and Japan.

The underlying idea that clearly emerges here is that if the financial institutions can hold their ground in such an extreme scenario, they will be well-positioned to withstand an adverse, but more probable scenario in the coming quarters.

How Did Each Financial Institution Do?

The key takeaway from the Fed’s stress test is the impact on Tier 1 common ratio for each of the 30 institutions tested under the severely adverse scenario. No doubt, each of the firms will see this benchmark figure fall from current actual values under the test conditions, but the amount it actually falls is governed by a firm’s business model, loan portfolio as well as the type of assets on its balance sheet. The table below represents the change in the Tier 1 common ratio for these firms from their current figure (circle) to their minimum level (diamond) as determined by the test.

The highlighted data point represents the combined performance of all the 30 participating firms. The 5% mark shown is the cut-off required for a firm to pass the stress test. The only bank that fails to meet this standard is Zions. Although Zions is currently in pretty good shape compared to some of its other regional competitors like PNC, SunTrust and even U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), its balance sheet is not strong enough to sustain a downturn.

There are some other interesting things to note here. Custody banks – State Street (NYSE:STT), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), Northern Trust – and card-focused lenders – Discover (NYSE:DFS), American Express (NYSE:AXP) – figure among the best-capitalized firms in the list, and are also the ones least affected by the test scenario. On the other hand, all the globally diversified banks – Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), HSBC (NYSE:HBC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) – are seen at the bottom of the list in terms of worst minimum Tier 1 common ratios as the adverse scenario shaves off between five and eight percentage points from the benchmark for these banks.

What Does This Mean For These Banks Over The Coming Year?

As the stress test incorporates any corporate actions the banks proposed to undertake over the next year – including dividends, share repurchases and major acquisitions/divestitures – a bank which passes the test is almost certain to get its capital plan approved by the Fed (unless the Fed thinks otherwise due to some qualitative factor brought to its notice). While an increase in dividends and modest share buybacks are in the cards for most of the big banks, investors would be most interested in the capital return plans Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley release on March 24, as these three banks have maintained dividends at the token figure of 1 cent since the economic downturn.

More than 400 customers had filed a lawsuit against the company for $1.6 billion, stating economic losses and causing Toyota to recall more than 10 million vehicles worldwide between 2009 and 2010. Toyota had settled 131 cases by March 17 and is trying to settle 300 more, Bloomberg reported, citing a status report filed in Santa Ana, Calif. Over the past four years, U.S. investigators have been examining how Toyota dealt with driver complaints about a sudden increase in acceleration in its vehicles and whether the company made incomplete disclosures.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Steve Curtis, a spokesperson for Toyota, said according to Bloomberg. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The Department of Justice also found that Toyota had made misleading statements to the U.S. government and the public about safety problems in its vehicles, which came to light during the company's internal audit.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, said in 2010 that five people had died as a result of accidents due to unwanted acceleration, according to the Wall Street Journal. Toyota has been fined four times by the NHTSA for a total of $66.2 million, for not reporting safety defects to the government, out of which three fines were related to unwanted acceleration.

In February, the company had recalled 2.1 million vehicles worldwide due to a software problem, which led to sudden stops in models such as the Prius, RAV4, Tacoma and Lexus. Since 2009, Toyota recalls have affected more than 14 million vehicles worldwide.

The automaker, which faces investigations by two congressional committees, the NHTSA and a criminal inquiry by a Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, is expected to avoid criminal charges under the terms of the latest settlement.

Toyota’s settlement closely follows a federal government investigation into General Motors, or GM, (NYSE:GM) over the company's handling of decade-long problems involving faulty ignition switches and malfunctioning airbags. The problems have forced Detroit-based GM to recall more than 3 million vehicles in the last two months.###3097||Walmart getting into used games business Walmart has announced that it will be accepting trade-in games for store credit starting next week, and will begin selling used games later this year.

The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."###3098||CLOSE HLN says Wal-Mart will soon let customers trade in old video games for gift cards.

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###3102||Empty###3103||There’s another money mint in town as San Francisco startup Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10 billion, according to the WSJ.

The Journal reports that the private-equity firm TPG — which also has a stake in the ride-sharing service Uber — is in line to lead the funding round, which could total between $400 million and $500 million.

For a reality check, at $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than hotel chains like Wyndham ($9.4 billion) and Hyatt ($8.4 billion), but less than Hilton ($22 billion).

It’s not often that start-ups get valued at $10 billion plus, but we’re starting to see a few now with DropBox being worth $10 billion and Facebook buying WhatsApp last month for $16 billion. Reality check: Facebook is worth $174 billion.

But Airbnb is not without its problems. As The Chronicle recently reported, renters in San Francisco are getting evicted for Airbnb-ing their apartments. And last fall, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts, checking to see if they were violating a law forbidding them from renting their units for less than 30 days if they’re not around.###3104||Empty###3105||Empty###3106||Markets are showing up red this morning after the US Federal Reserve chairwoman hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 are down marginally this morning while the Nikkei 225 and Shanghai Composite index are also in negative territory.

This comes after Ms Yellen insisted there had been no change in Fed policy in spite of official forecast rates of 1 per cent by the end of next year - an increase in previous forecasts which suggested a median 0.75 per cent rate.

John McGrath, head of distribution at TwentyFour Asset Management said the Fed needed to “assure markets that any future rate rises are not just around the corner”.

“On this point we would expect the Fed to follow a Carney-style set of measures that essentially follow the output gap in the economy,” he said.

“The Fed’s assessment of the economy should aid us with roughly how big that gap is and how long the period might be to the first hike.”

However, the new forecasts by the Fed suggest there are differences of opinion within the Federal Open Markets Committee as to when rates need to rise.

(March 19, 2014 – CNN) — The Justice Department is set to announce as soon as Wednesday a billion-dollar agreement with Toyota to settle a federal probe of the automaker’s handling of customer complaints related to unintended acceleration, people familiar with the deal said.

The investigation led by the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has examined allegations that the Japanese automotive giant initially misled federal authorities after the complaints became a source of controversy in 2009.

Under the settlement, Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges and is expected to pay about $1 billion, those familiar with the agreement said.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” a Toyota spokeswoman said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The Justice Department didn’t comment on the planned announcement.

Toyota recalled millions of cars in 2009-10, after years of doing little beyond changing floor mats in response to complaints to federal auto safety regulators about acceleration problems in popular models.

Regulators were also criticized for their handling of the matter in the years leading up to the massive recalls.

Top company executives came under fire in two congressional hearings during that time in which lawmakers accused Toyota of not doing enough to respond to safety concerns. Stiff safety fines were imposed by the Transportation Department.

Toyota has settled similar allegations in agreements with a group of states, and has also paid settlements to some Toyota car owners.

The Toyota agreement comes with Bharara’s office just starting to look into a safety issue at General Motors. The FBI, which conducted the Toyota probe, is now gathering evidence on the GM complaints.

GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month.###3109||The Vermont Department of Labor says the state's unemployment rate for January was 4 percent, a drop of two-tenths of one percent from December.

New York City tourists these days are increasingly opting to rent space in a strangers' house through sites like Airbnb to avoid staying in a pricey hotel, but officials say the practice is often illegal, undercuts the hotel industry, avoids taxes and threatens apartment building safety.

Airbnb, a site that allows users to rent out couches, rooms, apartments and homes could be valued as much as $10 billion, a report says.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the startup is in the process of starting a new fundraising round worth $400 million to $500 million.

The company hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability. According to its site, there are more than 600,000 listings worldwide.

At $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than several large hotel companies, even more so than Wyndham Worldwide and Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, says the report.

Twitter must get a legal representative in Turkey and agree to block individual accounts if it is to resolve a row that has led the government to block access to the service, Industry Minister Fikri Isik said on Friday.

Courts blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local polls, to "wipe out" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

Tech-savvy Turks, President Abdullah Gul apparently among them, quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey rapidly moving to among the top trending globally.

"One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the pugnacious prime minister.

Corruption scandal

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.

Turkey's main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country's bar association filed a separate court challenge.

Twitter users called it a "digital coup", some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.

There were also calls for protests.

"Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations," United States author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, wrote on his Twitter feed.

The ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Conciliatory figure

Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticise the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the brewing scandal and the latter's increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.

The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the courts had blocked Twitter after citizens complained that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.

"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens," it said.

European Union enlargement commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and "cast doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards". Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.

German disapproval

The government of Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British foreign office said social media had a "vital role to play in a modern democracy".

Turkey's financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the US dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24% from 11.12%.

San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday.

"Twitter, mwitter!," he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!".

"We will wipe out all of these," Erdogan said. "The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is," he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.

Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary. Finance Minister Mehmet also played down concerns, telling state broadcaster TRT Haber that the closure "does not derive from a prohibitive mentality" and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling. – Reuters###3118||Empty###3119||BELEAGUERED BITCOIN EXCHANGE Mt Gox has found some of its missing Bitcoins.

The outfit turned up 200,000 coins in an old digital wallet that was thought to be empty, said CEO Mark Karpeles in a statement (PDF). 200,000 coins are worth over $100m.

"MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain old format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins," it said in the statement, explaining that the coins were uncovered earlier this month in a file that had not been used since mid 2011.

Karpeles said that the discovery puts 200,000 Bitcoins in Mt Gox's hands, but added that still means 650,000 Bitcoins have been lost or stolen. It is possible that Mt Gox has overestimated its losses.

"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC." Karpeles explained.

"Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of Bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation."

This month the exchange won bankruptcy protection in the US and a stay of any lawsuits against it. This prompted suggestions that the US bankruptcy court was letting the fox guard the hen house.

The line from the firm is that it is not at fault and is the victim of theft or a bug. Now it should probably add that it is a bit forgetful as well.

"At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the Bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete Bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that Bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug," Karpeles said earlier.

"As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of Bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared." µ###3120||Empty###3121||The fresh wave of US sanctions against Russia include banning some of the country's richest and most influential businessmen - and President Vladimir Putin's closest friends - from entering America.

Among the individuals targeted with and travel bans and freezing of US assets are billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

The co-owners of SMP Bank and SGM Group, a major supplier of construction services to Russian gas giant Gazprom, were judo sparring partners with Mr Putin.

The pair - friends of Mr Putin since childhood - also made billions in Sochi Olympics-related contracts.

Financier Yuri Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya, is a personal banker for senior Russian officials - including, reportedly, Mr Putin. He is another close friend - and a neighbour - of the president.

They have known each other since the early 1990s when Mr Kovalchuk was deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

The bank - also on the hit list - serves some of the country's wealthiest officials and controls two big insurance firms - Sogas and SK Transneft.

High-level Kremlin officials including Mr Putin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov and deputy chief of staff Alexei Gromov are also targeted, as well as Vladimir Yakunin, chairman of the board of the Russian state-owned company Russian Railways and a close confidant of the president.

Gennady Timchenko, a prominent businessman and owner of the private investment group, Volga Group, which specialises in investments in energy, transport and infrastructure assets is also named by the US.

President Putin's spokesman said some of the names on the list caused "nothing but extreme bewilderment" - and Russia immediately responded with its own list of sanctions on American officials.

These included Obama aides Caroline Atkinson (deputy assistant and deputy national security adviser for international economics), Daniel Pfeiffer (senior adviser and assistant ), and Benjamin Rhodes (assistant and deputy national security adviser for strategic communications and speechwriting), as well as senators Mary Landrieu, John McCain and Daniel Coats.

Mr McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate, and Mr Putin have long been engaged in a bitter personal feud.

During their last war of words in September 2013, the US senator accused Mr Putin of corruption, repression and self-serving rule in an opinion piece for a Russian website in response to a letter Mr Putin wrote in The New York Times, urging America not to use military force in Syria.

In an opinion piece headlined "Russians Deserve Better Than Putin", Mr McCain also accused the president of being "a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed" for siding with Syria's President Bashar al Assad.

Back in December 2011, Mr Putin let his views be known on Mr McCain after the US politician tweeted "Dear Vlad, The #ArabSpring is coming to a neighbourhood near you" at a time of huge protests across Moscow.

When pressed about the tweet during a televised phone-in, the Russian president hit back, calling the senator "nuts".

"Mr McCain fought in Vietnam. I think he has enough blood of peaceful citizens on his hands. It must be impossible for him to live without these disgusting scenes anymore," he said.

Mr Putin added: "Mr McCain was captured and they kept him not just in prison, but in a pit for several years. Anyone [in his place] would go nuts."

Earlier this month, Speaker of the House John Boehner, also on the Russian list, called Mr Putin a "thug" over its actions in Crimea, according to The Enquirer.

The Republican told the Cincinnati newspaper it was "time to stand up to Putin", adding: "At what point do you say enough is enough? We are at that point."

He, and Senators Landrieu, McCain and Coats hailed their inclusion on the Russian list as a "badge of honour", while the White House refused to comment.###3122||It’s like a scene straight from one of the video games it sells.

GameStop, the biggest seller of used video games, opened its doors Tuesday to find the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, was taking aim at one of its main lines of business.

Walmart said Tuesday it will step up its game and start offering store credit to customers who trade in used video games.

Scared by the upcoming battle, investors sent shares of Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop down 3.4 percent, to $38.39, Tuesday.

The used video-game business is a lucrative one, and GameStop likely has no intention of backing down.

“Our buy-sell-trade program creates a unique value proposition to our customers by providing our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products and mobile devices for store credits and apply those credits toward other merchandise, which in turn, increases sales,” the company said in its most recent 10K regulatory filing.

There are roughly 2.3 billion used games in circulation, GameStop estimates, so there is not likely to be a shortage any time soon.

It’s clear why customers like buying second-hand video games. The average price of a used video game is $19 at GameStop, compared with $41 for a new one, according to the company.

As of December 2012, the company had 3,100 different used video-game titles in its inventory throughout its 6,600 stores.

Roughly 27 percent, or $2.4 billion, of its total revenue of $8.9 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2013, came from used video games, the company said.###3123||Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis who voted against the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision this week to update its forward guidance, today offered an explanation of his dissent.

"This appointment follows the termination of as the company's president and CEO and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors," said in a statement.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, it added.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman said.

Bennett was roped in to head the US-based firm in July 2012 when its then President and CEO Enrique Salem was asked to leave the company after a 19 year association with Symantec, including three years as the CEO.

"It was the board's judgement that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO," Symantec had said.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation.

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

He will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its compensation and leadership development committee or nominating and governance committee.

Board member Robert S Miller will replace Brown as the chair of the compensation and leadership development committee.###3125||Empty###3126||The Royal Mint unveils new £1 coin design The Royal Mint has unveiled a new £1 coin design in a bid to reduce counterfeiting and ‘ensure the integrity’ of UK currency.

It takes the form of a twelve-sided coin and bears a strong resemblance to the three pence piece, or ‘threepenny bit’, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971.

A public design competition will determine what the reverse, or ‘tails’ side of the coin looks like.

Although the coin is not expected to be introduced until 2017, a prototoype has been produced as a template for what The Royal Mint says will be ‘the most secure circulating coin in the world to date.’

The finished coin will be made of two different coloured metals and contain what The Royal Mint calls an Integrated Secure Identification System.

iSIS has been developed by The Royal Mint’s in-house technology team ‘and involves the application of an existing security technology that has been proven over decades in banknotes,’ says the Mint, which claims that this is a first for coins.

A public consultation will be held over the summer focussing on the impact of the coin before specifications and metal composition are decided on.

The Royal Mint will also work with key stakeholders to understand the impact on industry.

George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer says, ‘After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

‘With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.’###3127||Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Morning Glory's evasion of a naval blockade led to the sacking of the PM

The US says it has returned the rogue oil tanker Morning Glory to the Libyan government.

The North Korea-flagged ship had been loaded at a rebel-held port and evaded a naval blockade before being boarded by US Navy Seals south of Cyprus.

Its evasion prompted parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

The US said it had handed over the ship, cargo and crew to Libyan forces in international waters off the coast of Libya.

Rebels had loaded the Morning Glory with oil at the port of Sidra. It was unclear where it was heading.

It was the first vessel loaded at a rebel-held port since a separatist revolt against the central government in Tripoli erupted in July 2013.

'Smoothly'

Rebels under Ibrahim Jathran hold three ports, and are demanding a greater share of the country's oil revenue.

Earlier, the Lana state news agency reported clashes between his fighters and Libyan troops in his hometown of Ajdabiya.

The US embassy said in a statement that the handover of ship, cargo and crew had gone "smoothly and as planned".

It added: "We have been assured by the government of Libya that the captain, crew members and Libyan nationals who were aboard the stateless tanker will be treated humanely in accordance with internationally recognised standards of human rights."

The Navy Seals operation had been authorised by President Barack Obama and no-one was hurt.

The vessel was flagged in North Korea but officials in Pyongyang said it had been deregistered because of the incident. It was said to have been operated by an Egyptian company.

The Libyan government is still struggling to assert its authority on rebel groups that helped to overthrow Col Muammar Gaddafi.###3128||Oh no! Page not found

Despite the orgy ordeal that forced a comedian to vacate his Chelsea apartment, Airbnb is in talks raise money that would value the apartment rental service at an eye-popping $10 billion.

Airbnb, which counts actor Ashton Kutcher as an early backer, is in talks to raise between $400 million and $500 million from a group of investors that will likely be led by private-equity firm TPG, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Post.

At the $10 billion valuation, the San Francisco startup would be worth more than established hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide, valued at $8.45 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.

The talks are in the advanced stages, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.

Before this latest funding round, Airbnb was valued at $2.5 billion based on $326 million from financial backers, including venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Founder’s Fund.

Kutcher, Demi Moore’s ex, was named an Airbnb “strategic adviser“ after he invested in the venture in 2011.

Earlier this week, Airbnb found itself in a hot mess when Ari Teman discovered that his apartment, which had he had listed on Airbnb, had hosted a wild sex party advertised on Twitter as a “XXX FREAK FEST.”

Teman thought he was renting the pad to someone who was going to use it to host some wedding guests.

Airbnb has since put Teman up in a hotel and banned the party planner from its website. It is also discussing reimbursing him for the damage to his home.

“Airbnb has been responsive, and we are still in talks,” Teman told The Post about the bizarre episode, which he said left his furniture unusable and his clothes mysteriously damp.

Aside from the raunchy party, Airbnb is being probed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over a state law that forbids people from renting their homes for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is also present.

The AG is also concerned that some Airbnb hosts are avoiding a 14.75 percent state occupancy tax.

Schneiderman has asked for data on as many as 225,000 New Yorkers who have rented out rooms through Airbnb since 2010. The company has been fighting the data request, arguing it invades its users’ privacy.###3130||There is a major election next week, and the PM has been linked to a massive corruption probe in the nation.

The coin, which is intended to be the “most secure in the world”, draws inspiration from the design of the old 3d (3 penny) coin, which was in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

It will launch in 2017, and comes following concerns the 30-year old coin is becoming vulnerable to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

In a statement, the Royal Mint said: “The proposed £1 coin design is distinctly British, with a twelve-sided shape which evokes memories of the pre-decimalisation threepence piece.”

The coin will be made of two different coloured metals and contain security features in line with the Royal Mint’s currency security network, iSIS.

The public and industry stakeholders will be consulted on the proposals this summer. There will also be a competition for the design on the reverse, or ‘tails’, side of the coin.

Kerry Koonce crunches the numbers for Iowa Workforce Development. “Our rate was at 4.3-percent — it’s a tenth of a percent up from 4.2 in December. Part of that is due to benchmarking as the numbers change a little bit. But, compared to January 2013 — we were at five percent — so we are significantly below where we were a year ago,” Koonce says.

The benchmarking Koonce mentioned is the annual process where they bring all of last year’s monthly numbers up to date before figuring the new year numbers. Koonce says the numbers released each month sometimes don’t include all the information available. “Sometimes it’s a quarter later when all of the data comes in, January’s data, it can be April before we see everything. So we go back and true up those numbers to what the real information is from what employers report on their quarterly information and those kinds of things,” Koonce says. “And so you will see some changes in each month’s numbers of the previous year which overall can have an impact on what the annual rate is and those kinds of things.”

The numbers show the state lost 7,300 jobs from December to January. “The majority of that came in the trade, transportation and utilities area…most of it in retail trade. And what it looks like is the seasonable adjustment numbers maybe didn’t capture everything. So, we are expecting that maybe next month that’s going to kind of even back out,” according to Koonce.

Fifty-six-hundred of the lost jobs were in that trade, transportation and utilities sector. “We think that when the February numbers come out — and those will come out later this month — we will see where we are normally at this time of year,” Koonce says.

Regardless of how the numbers are adjusted, she says the overall picture is improving. “We’re almost a full percentage point below where we were this time last year. So that’s a significant improvement for our economy as we continue move forward,” Koonce says. “Plus, our unemployment claims continue to decrease, new claims continue to go down.” The January 2013 unemployment rate for the state was five percent.

The U.S. unemployment rate for January inched down to 6.6-percent from 6.7-percent in December. This was the lowest national rate since October 2008.###3138||###3139||Empty###3140||Empty###3141||Empty###3142||Additional Radiation Release Reported at NM Nuclear Waste Plant

It means to prove that point by offering customers the prices that its competitors charge. While the program has its risks, it may also prove the no other retailer can match the bulk of its discounts.

According to a report:

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form a store credit. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

Customers register online, and then put in the tag number of their receipts into a database which spiders prices from advertising posted by Walmart’s competitors. Clothing and electronics products will not be part of the program. However, the matching system will work by market, so customers actually have a practical means of using the program

Of course, “Savings Catcher” could trigger price wars — and drive down the profits of any retail which wishes to use discounts to draw customers. Walmart has the advantage of its balance sheet and low cost of doing business. It is among the U.S. companies which pays its employees the least.

Walmart has good reason to take the risk. Same store-sales and revenue in the United States have stagnated. It also has had trouble openings stores in the nation’s largest cities, where there is political pressure from smaller retailers to keep Walmart out. Its stock price has been stuck in a range of $70 to $81 for about a year. The stock closed Friday at $76.10 but is down 3.3% this year.

Walmart has taken a chance with “Savings Catcher.” However, it does not have many other means to improve its embattled store sales.###3144||17.15 That is where we are going to close the blog for today.

IFS questions Budget figures

14.30 Here's the bombshell graph from that IFS report - the Government's change to pension rules, allowing people to withdraw their pots instead of buying annuities, will increase borrowing in the long term rather than lowering it, as the Office for Budget Responsibility said it would yesterday.

This is because there is only a short term boost from a rush of pensioners taking their money out, which is taxable.

13.30 The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the think thank, has raised questions over the OBR's sums around how much income the Treasury will receive from liberalising pensions.

The IFS's Paul Johnson said the expected higher income from pensioners drawing down taxable lump sums depend "on highly uncertain behavioural assumptions about when people take the money".

He added that allowing pensioners to access their entire pot would be potentially risky, and that those aged 60-65 tend to underestimate their own life expectancy.

Trader fined £662,700 for attempting to manipulate QE

Stevenson's abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and, ultimately, for UK tax payers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions.

Odds almost even on Mulberry takeover

12.00 Mulberry's CEO Bruno Guillion is out the door this morning, and somewhat insultingly, the market likes it - shares are up 2pc as of midday.

Paddy Power has put together the odds on the company's future, and is offering 11/10 on the company being taken over by the end of the year.

Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) and Kering are Paddy Power's favourites to dip into their pockets and buy Mulberry, both at 3/1.

Mortgage lending rises 43pc in a year

11.20 With Help to Buy now due to continue until the election after next, the housing revival looks set to continue for some time. Today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show a 43.1pc rise in the value of mortgage lending between February 2013 and February 2014.

February lending of £15.2bn was the best February performance since 2008. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the data highlights the need for policymakers to keep an eye on prices:

Once strong upward momentum has developed in the housing market, it can be hard to stop – especially if interest rates are unlikely to rise markedly.

We expect house prices to increase by around 8% in 2014 with gains across the country. Furthermore, there is a genuine possibility that this could prove to be a conservative forecast particularly if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is increasingly supported by the “Help to Buy” mortgage guarantee scheme.

FTSE now falling below 6,500

10.50 The stock market remains weak, with the FTSE 100 now down 1.2pc, or some 78 points, at 6,494 after the Fed last night sparked fears about sooner-than-expected interest rate rises. Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at spread-betting firm IG, said:

Sometimes all it comes down to is a single sentence. Janet Yellen will be pondering over her performance last night, after she spooked markets with talk of an earlier-than-expected rise in US interest rates.

Although the Fed’s statement implied there would be a ‘considerable’ gap between the end of QE and the first rate hike, Yellen’s definition of considerable as ‘around six months’ wasn’t as long as some had hoped.

Barnier: Banking union will 'put end to massive bailouts'

10.00 The EU banking commissioner Michel Barnier says the agreement on banking union was reached at 7am this morning after 16 hours of negotiations.

Today's compromise allows us to complete the architecture of the banking union for the eurozone. This would not have been possible without the assiduous work and spirit of compromise demonstrated by both co-legislators

He said that banking union will create financial stability and mean banks will not require huge bailouts funded by taxpayers any more.

Together with the reforms to the financial sector for all 28 countries, the completed banking union will put an end to the era of massive bailouts. It will further contribute to the return to financial stability thus creating the right conditions for the financial sector to once again lend to the real economy which is essential to consolidate the economic recovery and to create jobs.

FTSE continues slide

09.00 The FTSE 100 is now down 44 points, or 0.7pc, at 6,528 as investors take fright at the prospect of interest rate hikes in the US. Gerard Lane, economist at Shore Capital, said:

The Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in the post-FOMC conference gave a shock to investors by suggesting that the gap between the end of QE tapering, scheduled at the end of October, and the first interest rate rise could be ‘around six months’. Given the market expectations were towards the end of 2015, for markets to consider an interest rate rise in the April 2015 resulted in sharply higher bond yields.

Osborne: More difficult decisions will be required

08.30 George Osborne has been on Radio 4 speaking about yesterday's Budget. He says policies to reduce energy bills for businesses are an attempt to put the UK on a level playing field with the rest of Europe:

We thought the European carbon trading scheme would work better than it did. The hard fact is that British businesses were going to be unable to compete with those on the continent. It will help many manufacturers who arent particularly energy intensive but do have high energy bills. We want to stay competitive create an economy where companies such as Hitachi choose to come to Britain.

More difficult decisions are required but I think we've shown we're capable of doing that. Public services have improved crime is down, we've protected the NHS budget so we've proved we've got the right approach to this. The big picture is we've got a long term economic plan that is working and brining economic security to Britain.

We don't manufacture enough, we don't export a lot, we don't save enough, we don't invest a lot and that's what future budgets are going to be about.

Have You Saved $2,500 Lately?

President Obama recently admitted that ObamaCare will cause some Americans to lose their doctors. Some have suggested that his promise “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” should be 2014’s “Lie of the Year.” But what about his promise that ObamaCare would lower premiums by $2,500 per family?

As we—what’s the opposite of celebrate?—the fourth anniversary of ObamaCare’s passage this weekend, Americans have already seen their premiums double or even triple. And premiums aren’t finished going up. Next year’s rates won’t be released until this summer, but The Hill recently spoke to insurance company officials and got a frightful preview of where they’re headed. One “insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange.” More…

The new laws are minor adjustments to the sweeping pot regulations adopted last year.

The first measure requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

The second measure allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already must have state-level background checks, so the change is not expected to add any additional work for the CBI.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia’s southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it’s probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia’s capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."

News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.

"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.

But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don’t have -- the location of MH370."

Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).

Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.

"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.

The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.

Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."

Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.

Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.

Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.

Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association told The Associated Press.

"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.

The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.

Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane’s pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.

The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.

Australian authorities are leading an international search along a southern arc for Flight MH370, which vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board after taking off for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

The objects were spotted by the Chinese aircraft from 33,000 feet, as it was heading back to Perth.

Drift modelling was undertaken on the sighting but the P-8 was unable to relocate the reported objects.

The Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft spotted two relatively big floating objects and several smaller white ones dispersed over several kilometers.

The official Xinhua news agency carried the report, saying the "white and square" objects were spotted by searchers aboard a Chinese Ilyushin jet. Two floating were "relatively big" and there several smaller white ones dispersed over several kilometres.

The crew reported the co-ordinates as 95.1113 degrees east and 42.5453 south to the Australian command centre as well as Chinese icebreaker Xuelong, which is en route to the area on Monday, AFP reports.

However, Australian authorities later said the US Navy had been unable to find the objects.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said its search area also continues to be based on US satellite images of two floating objects taken on 16 March.

Chinese aircraft join search

Chinese aircraft joined nine others from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan on Monday in the search of remote seas 2500km off Western Australia, where it is thought the plane may have crashed.

The search took on a new dimension after the French said on Sunday they had picked up images of possible aircraft debris some 850km north of the present search area.

Two Chinese military aircraft, two Australian P3 Orions and two ultra-long range civilian jets were the first to search the site on Monday. Another ultra-long range jet, a US Navy P8 Poseidon and two Japanese P3 Orions would go later in the day.

Australian Navy tanker HMAS Success is also searching and several Chinese ships are on their way to help find any objects spotted from the air.

Tropical Cyclone Gillian, near Christmas Island, could bring bad weather south, hindering search efforts.

New theory on malfunction

A new report says military radar shows the plane turned as much as 180 degrees and dived to about 4000 metres - a height at which people can breath without oxygen masks - when it turned from its route to Beijing.

The new detail may support a theory that there was a major malfunction, such as a cockpit fire. Military radar tracking shows that the aircraft changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation into the missing flight told CNN.

The plane flew as low as 4000 metres at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The sharp turn seemed to be intentional, the source told CNN.

The official said the area the plane flew in after the turn was a heavily trafficked air corridor and that flying at the lower height would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic.

NZ crew remain hopeful

The crew of a New Zealand Air Force Orion remains upbeat, despite another failed attempt to find the airliner. The Orion returned to its base in Western Australia about 4.30am on Monday after its latest search.

RNZAF Squadron Leader Brett MacKenzie was on board that flight and said spotting debris from the air is a difficult task.

"You're travelling in an aircraft that's doing 200 miles per hour. The world is whistling past you and you're looking for an object in amongst the whitecaps. You've got to be concentrating constantly - two, two-and-a-half hours - so a couple of moments of inattention you might miss something that's important."

The search on Sunday was hampered by thick fog and cloud, but acting chief of the Air Force Air Commodore Mike Yardley said the Orion's crew haven't given up hope of finding the airliner. He said searchers have been buoyed by the news radar echoes from a French satellite showing possible debris in the search area have been passed to Australian authorities.

"They think with the weight of evidence they're seeing from the operations staff briefing them that they are in the right area and they're determined to go out there and find something."

Air Commodore Yardley said New Zealand has been asked to provide more staff to analyse data from satellites and search planes. "Weather conditions were not great. We had sea fog right down to the surface of the water in half the area; then 600 foot of cloud in the other half of the area - so not great searching conditions."###3154||Text size

In a statement, Symantec said Bennett has also resigned from the board of directors. Brown joined Symantec's board after the merger with Veritas Software in July 2005. Brown had been CEO of Quantum.

The company noted that it will begin a search for a new CEO immediately. Symantec Chairman Daniel Schulman said the decision to swap out Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Nevertheless, Bennett was well along with Symantec's restructuring and refocusing. Symantec said that it still plans to meet its 5 percent annual growth revenue growth target by fiscal 2017 with non-GAAP operating margins topping 30 percent.

While it's unclear why Bennett was terminated, Symantec indicated that its guidance for the fourth quarter remained unchanged. Symantec sees fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents a share to 42 cents a share on revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion, down from $1.75 billion a year ago.

“Twitter, mwitter!” Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cried on Thursday. Rough translation: Twitter, schmitter! This was the last thing Erdogan said Thursday before the lights went out on Twitter near midnight. “We now have a court order,” declared Erdogan, who’s ensnared in a scandal inflamed by social media over recordings that purportedly reveal corruption in his administration. “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”

Oh, everyone’s witnessing it all right.

The funny thing about a global social-media platform, as some are starting to notice today, is that it’s not as easy as Erdogan might think to shut down by way of an order from a Turkish court.

Indeed, there are 12 million people online in Turkey, and quite a few of them – including some high-ranking government officials in the country – found it quite easy to tweak their domain settings and circumvent the Prime Minister’s effort to “eradicate” the communications tools.

Making matters worse, the pointless effort drew considerable international attention, all of it bad.

“The United States is deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world.”

Turkey, let’s not forget, is also under consideration for membership in the European Union, and stunts like these won’t help. “As a candidate country,” the British Foreign Office said, “it is important for Turkey to promote the E.U.’s core values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law.”

And perhaps most important of all is the reason Erdogan made the move in the first place.

When there are corruption allegations , and a government’s instinct is to address the charges by attacking the communications tools people are using to discuss the allegations, it’s time for officials to reevaluate their priorities.

Since December, when a corruption investigation ensnared government officials and businessmen, including the son of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, social media networks including Twitter and YouTube have become critical alternatives to traditional media outlets. A barrage of leaks of dozens of phone calls and documents posted by unidentified critics has presented Mr. Erdogan with perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office. Some of the leaks related to efforts by Mr. Erdogan to control the media in Turkey, where, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, 40 journalists were in jail in 2013. The prime minister was accused of making personal calls to media executives and seeking to have vocal critics fired. The government called the recordings fakes, although independent analysts said they were authentic. One recording purported to be of the prime minister telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly – and angrily – insisted that the recording was fake.###3164||Empty###3165||Empty###3166||Mortgage Lawsuits News | Mortgage Litigation Index

FHFA MBS Settlements Surpass $10 Billion Non-agency MBS sold to Fannie and Freddie at issue March 21, 2014 By Mortgage Daily staff





The latest settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency brings to more than $10 billion the amount the regulator has collected from parties that allegedly sold faulty securities to the government-sponsored housing enterprises.



FHFA filed 18 lawsuits in 2011 against issuers and underwriters of private-label MBS that were sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007.



The lawsuits alleged that the defendants violated the Securities Act of 1933 by deceiving the secondary lenders about the quality of the MBS and the underwriting performed on the loans.

A third set of images, this one from a French satellite, show potential objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean that could be linked to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, which has been missing since March 8, when it disappeared from radar screens.

The images, clarified by the French ministry as satellite-generated radar echoes, or radar signals that give information about an object's location, do not seem to have been publicly released, though they were immediately sent to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is now coordinating the plane search near Perth, according to the Malaysian Ministry of Transport.

The newly spotted object or objects were floating about 1,430 miles (2,300 kilometers) from Perth, Australia, according to the Sunday Times, a Singapo

re news site. [Facts about Malaysia Flight 370]

Satellite images from both China and Australia have revealed floating objects that may be Flight 370 debris in the same area over the past week.

The Malaysian Ministry of Transport didn't provide any other details about the French image or images or the object's location, the New York Times reported.

Even so, the image or images may solidify the idea that the plane fell into the ocean off Western Australia, after radically departing from its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, according to the Times.

The new image will also be compared with the past images of possible debris. The March 16 Australian satellite images of possible debris, which were released on March 20, showed two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysian aircraft, according to the AMSA. The objects (marked by arrows in the satellite images) measure up to 79 feet (24 meters) long and 16 feet (5 m) long, respectively, according to a Reuters report. (Searches in the area have yet to turn up the floating objects.)

The more recent Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released Saturday (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The image showed a large object — about 72 feet (22 m) by 43 feet (13 m) — some 75 miles (120 km) southwest of the location of the possible debris sighted by the Australian satellite, according to SASTIND officials. (The AMSA plotted the object and though its location fell within Saturday's search area it was not sighted, the AMSA reported.)

The new French satellite photo is the latest clue in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 jet; the search effort has focused on two vast swaths of ocean, one stretching north from Malaysia toward Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and another stretching south across the Indian Ocean.

Today's search involved eight aircraft, including a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon, along with the Royal Navy's HMAS Success, covering an area of nearly 23,000 square miles (59,000 square km) across two search regions within the Australia Search and Rescue Region in the southern Indian Ocean southwest of Perth.

The search will continue Monday, with the Chinese military Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft and Japanese P-3C aircraft expected to join the effort, according to the AMSA.

Putin said he did not wish to seize further parts of Ukraine, but still defied Western protests by formally declaring Crimea as part of Russia. Investors, however, seemed to be glad that the crisis is contained to the peninsular region for now as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished up 89 points or 0.6%, and the S&P 500 approached its record high once again, climbing 0.7%.

In other macroeconomic news, housing data was positive as February housing starts at 909,000 were roughly in line with estimates, but building permits, a leading indicator for the sector, jumped to 1.02 million, well ahead of January's total of 945,000 and better than expectations at 955,000. Data also showed that last month's Consumer Price Index increased 0.1%, indicating that inflation continues to be under control.

Leading the blue chips' gains today was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jumped 4%, hitting $39.55, or its highest point since 2000. The jump came on rumors that the software giant would introduce a version of its Office suite. According to Reuters, new CEO Satya Nadella could make the announcement at a March 27 event. Investors reacted well to the news as Office is Microsoft's most profitable product, but the decision could undercut sales of Microsoft's own Surface tablet, which runs on Windows and comes with Office installed. Still, analysts estimate that the Windows-maker is forgoing $2.5 billion a year by not making Office for the iPad. Considering the Surface has undersold expectations, perhaps the iPad strategy is the better direction.

Elsewhere on the Dow, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) said it wanted to get into the used video game business. The retail giant said starting March 26 it will allow customers to trade in used video games for credit on purchases at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart said it would refurbish the old games and sell them in "like-new condition." Investors did not have a strong reaction to the news, as used video games are just a $2 billion business, and Wal-Mart's entry is unlikely to be meaningful to its bottom line. Shares moved up just 0.1%, but when the world's largest retailer enters a new business there are bound to be consequences. Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME), the No. 1 retailer of new and used video games, fell as much as 6% and finished down 3.4% on the news. The effects of Wal-Mart's are unclear, but GameStop benefits from a smaller store format that is often more accessible and staff specialized in video games. Considering Best Buy and Target already offer such programs, I wouldn't expect the move to have an immediate impact on GameStop.###3169||Empty###3170||The new-look £1 coin, designed to be the hardest in the world to fake, has been unveiled. Based on the historic three pence piece, it will be introduced in 2017.

Ahead of Wednesday’s Budget, chancellor George Osborne tweeted an image of the £1 coin next to the Budget Box, saying, “Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin.”

The Royal Mint says that the coin’s launch is necessary because the current coin – which has been in circulation for 30 years – is vulnerable to counterfeiting.

The Treasury-owned body estimates that 3% of all existing £1 coins – about 45 million – are forgeries.

“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency,” they said.

The new coin is based on the design of the ‘threepenny bit’, a 12-sided coin that was used from 1937 to 1971. However, the new design will use pioneering technology developed by the Mint to make it easier to authenticate and much harder to duplicate.

It is hoped that the move will save taxpayers millions by cutting fraud, though in the short term the changeover may prove costly.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Royal Mint’s director of circulating coin sales Andrew Hill admitted that it is likely that coin-accepting machines across the country – such as parking meters and vending machines – will have to be adapted.

This process would cost the economy around £20 million over the next three years, he said.

“Our role is very important – for now it is to consult with our stakeholder and a major stakeholder is the automatic vending association.

“We have to make sure that, as well as being a secure coin, we look at the impact to industry and make sure that we do everything we can to make the changeover as smooth as possible.”

The replacement of the £1 coin follows the Bank of England’s announcement that plastic banknotes are to be brought into circulation in the UK by 2016.

The polymer notes are also said to be more difficult to counterfeit, more durable and resistant to water.

* U.S. Feb CPI up 0.1 pct, matches consensus estimate

* Yuan down against dollar and yen

* Yen benefits broadly, helped by Ukraine worries

By Daniel Bases

NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - A modest easing of geopolitical tension in Ukraine and a slight increase in U.S. Treasury yields took some premium away from the euro on Tuesday, sending it down against the U.S. dollar and the yen.

The Chinese yuan deepened its month of losses against the greenback on more signs of problems with a slowing economy and a heavily indebted corporate sector. The yuan’s weakness was seen as a benefit for the yen, helping lift it against the greenback.

Market strategists pointed to comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine as a signal the crisis may not deepen. Putin signed a treaty on Tuesday making Crimea part of Russia, defying Ukrainian protests and Western sanctions.

“Right now I am more inclined to treat this as intra-day noise,” said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. “As much as I do think geopolitics should be a bigger euro negative and bigger negative on Europe as exposures to Russia and Ukraine are much bigger, I don’t think the market is focusing on that. I think the market is focusing on the lack of escalation in the tensions.”

“I think the Crimea was a foregone conclusion and we have known that at least since the weekend. But I think the sanctions now are more rigorous or harder now than the sanctions that were put on Russia after they went into Georgia in 2008,” Chandler said.

The euro dipped 0.11 percent to $1.3904, having briefly broken down to $1.3891, but it essentially remained in a narrow trading range with a high on the day of $1.3941.

The crisis in Ukraine led to a sharp drop in Germany’s ZEW survey of investor and analyst sentiment, contributing to early losses for the euro.

The dollar fell to 101.51 yen, a loss of 0.25 percent against the Japanese currency.

There was little impact on markets from U.S. consumer inflation data, which showed a slight rise of 0.1 percent, a muted increase despite rising food prices.

“We see a significant risk off which is fading, linked to Ukraine, then we still have the worry of China, but it is not leading to contagion. It is receding,” said Sebastian Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York.

YUAN DROP

Reversing one of the past decade’s few sure bets in the foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan is down around 2.5 percent in the past month. That move has resumed since officials widened the trading band for the currency over the weekend.

A survey of 970 global investors by Barclays showed that China’s problems have replaced the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reining in of monetary policy as the biggest concern for market players since the start of 2014.

“I’ve squared up now but I think there’s a risk that the yuan could go to 6.30-6.40 per dollar,” said Graham Davidson, a foreign exchange trader at Australian bank NAB in London.

“The yen will tend to gain against the dollar as the yuan weakens.”

The yuan weakened to 6.1795 to the dollar versus Monday’s close around 6.1580.

There are differing schools of thought on the fallout for Japan of a weaker yuan. On the one hand it allows Japan’s big manufacturers to invest more cheaply in producing cars and electronics in China, while the competitive advantage of those factories also grows. Profits can then flow back into Japan.

On the other hand, a generally weaker Chinese economy poses problems for Japan given China’s importance as a market for Japanese products and investment.

Dealers say that many of those who were betting strongly at the start of this year on further gains for the yuan are still to be shaken out, and that the currency could go much lower.

The main barrier to that is the People’s Bank of China itself, which has kept its reference rate for the yuan around 6.13 for a week, encouraging speculation it may defend the top end of its newly widened 2 percent band around 6.25 per dollar.

“If the top of the band is 6.25-6.27 they are not showing any great signs of wanting to let that go,” Davidson said.

The yuan - which is not fully convertible internationally and trades in a complicated system of “offshore” and Chinese “onshore” rates - was 0.5 percent lower against its Japanese counterpart at 16.4331.###3173||Access to micro-blogging site Twitter is now blocked in Turkey. This comes after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's push for a ban of social media network.

"We will wipe out Twitter. I don't care what the international community says," he told followers at a rally in the run-up to March 30 local elections. Everyone could expect to see Turkey's strength, he added while drumming up support in the northwestern city of Bursa on Thursday (20.03.2014).

According to Turkish newspaper "Hürriyet," Erdogan's press department issued a statement shortly afterward to explain the prime minster's decree. Twitter had "ignored" Turkish court orders to remove certain links after Turkish citizens had filed complaints. On Friday (21.03.2014), Turkish newspaper "Radikal" published a statement by the public prosecutor's office which said that there was no court order to block Twitter.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, Turkish President Abdullah Gul made headlines by strongly criticizing the decision to block the platform. "One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, clearly circumventing the ban. "I hope this implementation won't last long."

Gul, a frequent user of social media, has been critical of Erdogan's censorship moves long before - he chafed at the beginning of March when Erdogan demanded YouTube and Facebook be blocked. "YouTube and Facebook are recognized platforms all over the world. A ban is out of the question," Gul said at the time.

Criticism continues online, despite the ban

According to market researchers GlobalWebIndex, around 40 percent of Turkish Internet users are registered on Twitter. After the ban was imposed, shortly after midnight, people turned to other social media platforms such as Facebook to vent about the Erdogan administration.

Turkey's president has criticized Erdogan's move and says Twitter should not be blocked

"It's such a shame to have Erdogan as prime minister. I fear he is going to shut down the entire country," a Facebook user wrote. "My beloved democratic country! After the elections you are going to block Facebook as well. These messages are the last bits of our freedom," another posted. People also drew comparisons to other countries where Twitter is blocked. "What countries are blocking Twitter? Yes indeed, Turkey is now on the same level as China," a Facebook user wrote.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, people began sharing tips via cell phone apps and videos on how to circumvent the ban by changing one's DNS settings to allow access to Twitter. "It took me two minutes to change the DNS settings; I can now use Twitter again," a Facebook user wrote. This trick was picked up by millions of other Twitter users. Just a few hours after Twitter was blocked, hashtags like #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were top of the global hashtag ranks.

Despite the ban, members of the Turkish government have continued to tweet as well - like Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc who announced that Erdogan's Justice and Development Party's (AKP) election campaign would be in the province of Manisa on Friday. "Arinc uses Twitter for his daily election campaign? Now I'm confused. Why then block the site at all?" a user complained.

Social media pressures Erdogan

Erdogan's fight against Twitter started last year when protests in Istanbul's Gezi Park were in full swing. He publicly called the platform a "menace," stressing again and again that Twitter was distributing lies. In the past year, Twitter has been used as the main means of communication for millions of demonstrators in Turkey. Mass protests were widely organized via the service.

People in Turkey have to resort to tricks to be able to access Twitter

But Erdogan and his government have increasingly come under pressure - more so after a corruption scandal involving the Erdogan administration was unveiled in mid-December. Since then, alleged telephone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal were leaked and published on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. In these conversations, Erdogan reportedly told his son to hide huge sums of money. It's still unclear to this date who is responsible for publishing these recordings. Erdogan has accused a parallel state led by US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former political ally of Erdogan.

Media expert Asli Tunc of Istanbul's Bilgi University told DW that shutting down Twitter doesn't make sense. "It's very hard to fight such technology. There will be software and programs that help people circumvent the ban," she said. The Turkish government blocked YouTube a couple of years ago, but even back then there had been many possibilities to circumvent the ban.

Amnesty International has also strongly criticized the ban and called on the Turkish government to immediately reinstate access to Twitter. "The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression," Amnesty International said in a statement.###3174||Empty###3175||Remember that time you left $20 in an old winter jacket and then spring happened and you put the jacket away and then when you took it back out the next winter and slipped your hand into your pocket you realized you were $20 richer than you thought? Funny story: that just happened to Mt. Gox, the troubled bitcoin exchange now mired in Japanese bankruptcy proceedings.

In a document released yesterday, Mark Karpelès, Mt Gox's 28-year-old CEO, announced that:

Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old ­format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC (199,999.99 BTC).

Of course, Karpelès writes, as soon as Mt. Gox discovered the missing bitcoins it brought the discovery to the attention of the Japanese judge in charge of the bankruptcy. Everything on the up-and-up.

Karpelès goes on to explain that this means that actually, Mt. Gox is missing fewer bitcoins due to the alleged hack that led it into bankruptcy:

MtGox Co., Ltd. had previously reported... that MtGox Co., Ltd. had lost almost all of the approximately 850,000 bitcoins it held... Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.

So, doing the math, there's been an overnight 23.5% reduction in the losses Mt. Gox suffered as a result of its alleged hack. This is nothing short of a Vernal Equinox Miracle. Four or five more little discoveries like this and the whole thing will be in the clear.

And don't worry, continues Karpelès:

(Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation.)

In other words, sit tight, every bitcoin person who may have lost large sums here! Do not pay attention to the men behind the curtain at Reddit, or the lawyers in that class action suit filed in a Chicago federal court, who believe that something fishy went on here.

Definitely don't read this Wired article about Karpelès' management practices inside Mt. Gox itself.

No, just sit tight. An investigation is ongoing. Karpelès has it covered.

A court blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to "wipe out" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.



Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.



"We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon," the company said in a tweet.



A company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.



Tech-savvy Turks — President Abdullah Gul apparently among them — quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.



"One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.



Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.



Turkey's main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country's bar association filed a separate court challenge.



Twitter users called the move a "digital coup", some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.



"Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations," U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.



Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.



Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticize the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter's increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.



The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.



Telecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.



"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens," it said.



European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and "cast doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards". Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.



Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a "vital role to play in a modern democracy."



Turkey's financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.



Twitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.



Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. "We will wipe out all of these," he said. "The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is."



Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure "does not derive from a prohibitive mentality" and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling

The Maine Department of Labor reported the preliminary figures estimate 43,900 job seekers were unable to find work in January, compared with 45,087 in December and 49,513 in January 2013.

The latest figures trend below the national unemployment rate, estimated at 6.7% in January.

More than 400 customers had filed a lawsuit against the company for $1.6 billion, stating economic losses and causing Toyota to recall more than 10 million vehicles worldwide between 2009 and 2010. Toyota had settled 131 cases by March 17 and is trying to settle 300 more, Bloomberg reported, citing a status report filed in Santa Ana, Calif. Over the past four years, U.S. investigators have been examining how Toyota dealt with driver complaints about a sudden increase in acceleration in its vehicles and whether the company made incomplete disclosures.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Steve Curtis, a spokesperson for Toyota, said according to Bloomberg. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The Department of Justice also found that Toyota had made misleading statements to the U.S. government and the public about safety problems in its vehicles, which came to light during the company's internal audit.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, said in 2010 that five people had died as a result of accidents due to unwanted acceleration, according to the Wall Street Journal. Toyota has been fined four times by the NHTSA for a total of $66.2 million, for not reporting safety defects to the government, out of which three fines were related to unwanted acceleration.

In February, the company had recalled 2.1 million vehicles worldwide due to a software problem, which led to sudden stops in models such as the Prius, RAV4, Tacoma and Lexus. Since 2009, Toyota recalls have affected more than 14 million vehicles worldwide.

The automaker, which faces investigations by two congressional committees, the NHTSA and a criminal inquiry by a Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, is expected to avoid criminal charges under the terms of the latest settlement.

Toyota’s settlement closely follows a federal government investigation into General Motors, or GM, (NYSE:GM) over the company's handling of decade-long problems involving faulty ignition switches and malfunctioning airbags. The problems have forced Detroit-based GM to recall more than 3 million vehicles in the last two months.###3182||Representatives from the European Parliament and EU governments were reported to have reached a preliminary deal Thursday on what's meant to be another crucial element of the bloc's banking union to emerge in heeding a lesson form the global financial crisis.

After 16 hours of talks in Brussels, negotiators said there had been a breakthrough, but details were not immediately available with the heads of the political factions in parliament overwhelmingly supporting the deal.

The EU's Market Commissioner, Michel Barnier, said the bank-wind down scheme "might not be a perfect construction" but would help to "put an end to the era of massive bailouts."

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble described the compromise as a mechanism to effectively control rescue funding and to minimize the risk to taxpayers. Schäuble also said that the participation of stakeholders in a bank rescue, known as bail-in, as well as completion of a bank rescue fund within 8 rather than 10 years were the most important issues.

Clear-cut modalities of how to wind down failing banks had been seen as a vital contribution to shielding taxpayers from the financial consequences of lenders' bailouts in future and an important instrument to restore trust in the single-currency system.

Who will foot the bill?

A major bone of contention had been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to pay how much into a joint pot to pay for any winding-down procedures. The common fund was expected to swell to 55 billion euros ($76 billion) within the next eight years.

Negotiators had been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May or else risk delaying the matter until 2015. The final opportunity for parliament to approve any accord is at its three-day session starting April 14.

A common bank wind-down mechanism is widely considered as important as the upcoming banking supervision by the European Central Bank (ECB) from November of this year, following a thorough check of the eurozone lenders' health and core capital.

The IRS inspector general says thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million. As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer.

Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license.

J. Russell George is the IRS inspector general. He said Thursday that real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail. He says real agents don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

He says people have been targeted in nearly every state.
