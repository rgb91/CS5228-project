Li told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further "unleash the potential" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.

He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."

"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.

Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.

Relations between China and the US have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.

Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.

China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the US, while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.

However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.

Associated Press###4028||King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the hit mobile game "Candy Crush Saga," is going public later this month. The Dubai-based company said they are planning to offer up 22.2 million shares priced between $21 to $24 each which, at the upper end, would value their company at $7.6 billion.

King is the latest mobile games creator to achieve staggering success in the space. In the first quarter of 2012, the company earned $22 million – a figure that skyrocketed to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

Their portfolio consists of 180 games across mobile, Facebook and on their own website but there’s no denying that Candy Crush Saga is the breadwinner here. In fact, the single franchise is responsible for around 75 percent of their total revenue. The title has been downloaded more than 500 million times and was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013.

Naturally, many are drawing comparisons with Zynga and Rovio – both of which had hit titles of their own. Popularity in Zynga’s Farmville has waned as its stock price has been cut in half since its 2011 IPO while Rovio has been clinging to the Angry Birds franchise for quite some time now.

Underwriters claim the stock will be priced on March 25 and will start trading the next day under the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol “KING.”###4029||Empty###4030||Rafferty Capital Markets’ Richard X. Bove comments on a recent development in the ongoing Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) tug-of-war between the government and shareholders.

Three Democrats from the Northeast in the House of Representatives are slated to introduce a bill this spring that might preserve the ownership rights of current investors in the Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC). They are John Delaney of Maryland, John Carney of Delaware, and Jim Hines of Connecticut.

Fannie Mae: Key provisions of the legislation

The key provisions of their legislation would be:

Expand the housing finance sector while the private sector accepts the risk.

Create incentives for the private capital in housing to grow.

Separate Fannie and Freddie from government backing.

Create funds for low-income housing.

The government would be involved as a reinsurer of risk. The first loss would be absorbed by private capital and the government would accept the next 95% of the risk in the new financial instruments.

[drizzle]

Representative Carney will be focusing on preserving the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. There is an understanding that if Fannie and Freddie go so will this mortgage. There is also an understanding that without Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) there will be no low-income housing built in this country.

Slowly but surely as the saying goes, the Congress is beginning to understand what they and the Treasury have done. They are strangling housing by forcing a cutback in funds to the sector. Plus, they are forcing housing prices down for every American.

Problems to arise from the Congress

It has been my core belief in getting involved in these stocks that the resolution to Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) problems will not be in the courts but rather it will come from Congress. The Treasury may lose the court cases but this does not mean that it will accept the decisions of the courts.

Congress must set the tone for what is to happen with these companies and it will do so based on the pure political consideration that if Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) goes a new recession will begin.

Congress is beginning to get it. The press remains clueless but it will come around also. The stakes are simply too high to ignore.

Irish based fruit supplier Fyffes is merging with rival Chiquita to create the world’s largest banana company.

The two firms are joining forces to form a monster fruit firm that will dwarf their rivals in the banana distribution market.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of e3.3. billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.

Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the firm based in North

Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million.

The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.

He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.

“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”

news@irishmirror.ie###4032||The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has made good on its promise to widen the trading band on the Yuan (CNY) this past weekend. They doubled the band. On Monday, Yuan continued its trend lower.

On Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent. This means the currency will fluctuate two percent above or under the midpoint fixed by the bank. As you can see in the chart below, USD/CNY weakened even further and continues its downtrend capital flowing in and out of the country along with sentiment in China weakens.

USD/CNY

As China’s economy continues to weaken further over the next months, the cost of capital should weaken as well. This means the exchange rate is likely to weaken further and volatility is likely to increase. Exchange rates are often set by short term cash flows in and out of a country. Export growth, should also benefit from a weaker currency. Domestic demand, like investments, along with reform initiatives should help the economy in the long term. It will not be surprising if the USD/CNY breaks below $6 some point in 2014.

This Move was Priced In

The move to widen the trading ban was expected with any change in the USD/CNY priced in. This is evident as the Yuan broke off its steady bullish trend and began falling. It has lost nearly two percent since the beginning of February. This weakening was a demonstration from policy makers who are ready to be more relaxed to freeing the currency up to market pressures. One step closer to a free floating currency. By allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet. They also sent a signal that they are confident in China’s ability to withstand and survive any policy reforms they PBOC and government are going to allow.

We should see the currency fall sharply this year as money moves out of China. For the year, we could see it depreciate another 6 to 6.5 percent.

This is not a Bad thing For China’s Economy

This is due to money invested in China finding new asset classes to invest in. As the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit. We have seen exports, for February, falling to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis. However, this move is not beneficial with helping China rebalance from an export and investment economy to one that is consumption driven.

This is a positive move for China a step in the right direction. We should be cautious as it is unlikely the PBOC will continue to relax its grip on the currency if it falls off sharply. The last time the bank widened the band was back in April of 2012. The Yuan weakened at first then strengthened. After its initial dip, it rose almost five percent versus the U.S. Dollar. The big change from last time, is sentiment. More and more analysts consider the sentiment more bearish and are bracing themselves for China to fall below their target 7.5 percent growth this year.

Binary Option Take for the Day

We should see volatility in the Yuan. Its steady rise higher or lower is no longer a sure bet which makes investors more and more eager to trade this currency. The question remains how much the PBOC is willing to allow market forces to dictate exchange price. Right now, sentiment is bearish.

Discussion:

Is the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan? While a step in the right direction, the Chinese Currency is far from being market driven or allowed to float freely. What is your take? Do you think the PBOC will relax its grip even more over the next year?###4033||It is easy to get carried away by this long-awaited stock market listing.

Longstanding concerns about the state of Threadneedle Street's internal governance reached new heights last week when the bank suspended an official after allegations that it knew about, or condoned, manipulation of foreign exchange rates.

Carney and Paul Fisher, the Bank's executive director of markets, will give evidence to the Treasury select on Tuesdaycommittee Carney will be under pressure to explain to Andrew Tyrie, the committee's chairman, why it took the Bank so long to act after allegations in October against two of its officials.

Last week, Tyrie said the Bank needed "a board worthy of the name", adding that the revelations had exposed a "byzantine" governance structure.

Andrew Love, a committee member said: "We will be asking the governor what steps he is taking to bring management arrangements and committee structure up to the standards of the 21st century."

Last Wednesday, the Bank published minutes of meetings of the chief dealers' sub-group of its foreign exchange standing committee, dating from 2005 until last year when the group was closed.

On the same day the bank suspended one of its officers, without giving their name or the reason for the suspension, and announced that its oversight committee – made up of non executive members of its governing body – would launch an inquiry.

It was reported at the weekend that inquiry could involve the appointment of a senior independent figure to oversee the process, drawn from the judiciary, the City or academia.

The Bank declined to comment on the report. However, it has appointed the law firm Travers Smith to prepare a report for the oversight committee, which will be made public.

Mark Garnier, another Treasury committee member, told Reuters any perceptions that the Bank was not tough enough on tackling problems could damage London's reputation as a financial centre, potentially weakening Britain's hand in European Union talks over financial reforms.

The court of the Bank of England, the organisation's governing committee, was criticised as not fit for purpose by former chancellor Alistair Darling in 2011. "It is all to do with the governor being some sort of Sun King around which the Court revolves," said Darling.

Publication of minutes detailing conversations between Bank staff and foreign exchange dealers have placed the spotlight on Martin Mallett, its chief dealer, who chaired the group. For its first few years, meetings were held not in conference rooms but at the tables of top City restaurants including The Don and Smiths of Smithfield. The issue of fixing was first raised at a meeting in July 2006, when attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings were flagged.

About 10 banks around the world have suspended or dismissed staff in relation to the growing forex scandal in recent weeks, and the Financial Conduct Authority is investigating the situation. John van Reenen, director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, said he hoped Carney would push to improve transparency and internal supervision.

"He's not as respectful of venerable British institutions as many people are, and from time to time you want to take a cold, hard look at whether the existing set of institutions really is fit for purpose in a modern age," said van Reenen. "He seems to be a person who is prepared to make those kind of changes."

The defence ministry ordered deployment of the vessels and planes to scour an area east of the islands in the Andaman Sea which are closer to Myanmar and Malaysia than India, a senior navy official said.

“India has formally joined the search operations this afternoon for the missing Malaysian airliner by sending three ships,” the official said in New Delhi, adding that India was coordinating with Malaysia's navy.

Malaysia is no closer to finding the plane that lost radar contact on Saturday, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, amid confusion and contradictions about what could have happened to it.

The search for the plane now encompasses both sides of peninsular Malaysia, over an area of nearly 27,000 nautical miles (more than 90,000 square kilometres) — roughly the size of Portugal — and involves the navies and air forces of multiple nations.

The Indian operation “is being conducted from the naval headquarters in New Delhi. Being a maritime search and rescue operation, the government… has asked the Indian navy to lead and conduct the operations,” the navy official said, adding that two Dornier aircraft and one P-8I maritime surveillance plane have also been deployed.

He said the INS Saryu, INS Kumbhir and ICG Kanaklata Barua were expected to reach the search area some 111 nautical kilometres (60 miles) east of Campbell Bay, on one of the southern islands, by late Thursday.

The Andaman and Nicobar islands are Indian territory, although they are at least 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the mainland.

India's coastguard joined the aerial search on Wednesday, deploying one aircraft also to the east of the Andamans.###4040||Empty###4041||In this Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014, photo, a recruiter Valera Kulow, left, speaks with job seeker Leonardo Vitiello during a career fair in Dallas. The Labor Department releases job openings and labor turnover survey for January on Tuesday, March, 11, 2014. (AP Photo/LM Otero)

WASHINGTON – U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.

The Labor Department said Tuesday employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November’s nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.

There are about 2.6 unemployed Americans, on average, for each open job, the report shows. That’s close to the ratio of 2 to 1 that is typical of healthier economies. The ratio of unemployed people to available jobs reached a record 6.7 in July 2009, just after the recession ended.

The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.

And a separate report by ManpowerGroup, the staffing company, found that U.S. employers are more optimistic about hiring this spring. Nineteen percent of companies surveyed said they planned to add jobs in the April-June quarter, the most since last fall.

Last week’s employment report showed 175,000 net job gains in February. That’s the number of people hired minus those who were laid off, quit or retired.

Tuesday’s government report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, provides more details. It shows the overall number of people hired each month, rather than just the net gain. It also includes data on the number of people quitting or being laid off.

Overall hiring slipped 0.9 percent to 4.5 million in January.

That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly 5 million people are hired each month.

The number of people who quit their jobs fell slightly last month, the report said, while layoffs ticked up.

The additional data in the JOLTs report illustrates how much churn is taking place in the job market. A healthier job market usually includes more people quitting and greater overall hiring.

Quits can be a positive sign because people typically quit when they have a new job or are confident they will find one. More quits also open up more positions for job-seekers.

Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has said the Fed is monitoring the quits and hiring figures as key indicators of the job market’s health.

Openings rose in January in construction, education and health care, and hotels and restaurants. They dropped in manufacturing and retail.###4042||The Indian unit of Toyota Motor Corp on Sunday suspended production at two of its plants after salary negotiations between workers union and management failed to break the deadlock.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) released a statement saying that it has locked out workers at the plants near Bangalore since Sunday. The statement did not reveal that when the lockout will end.

"Over the past 25 days, some workers have stopped production lines and disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government failed to reach an agreement over salaries," TKM said.

"The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," added the statement.

Tokyo-based Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino said that talks will continue to resolve the issue. He added that the suspension of the operations would result in a production loss of 700 vehicles on a daily basis.

TKM manufactures vehicles including the Fortuner and Innova at its 1st plant, which started its operation in 1997. The 2nd plant opened in 2010 and it manufactures the Etios and Corolla Altis.

In a separate development, the government has increased the import tariff value on gold to $445 per 10 grams from at $433 per 10 gram.

The import tariff value is the base price at which customs duty is determined to prevent under-invoicing. The import tariff value of silver has been reduced to $694 per kg from $699 per kg earlier, a notification by the Central Board of Excise and Customs said.

The government revises tariff value on a fortnightly basis after analysing the global price trend. Several measures had been taken by the government in the recent past to curb gold import and check the rising current account deficit.

The jewellers body said that the measures taken by the government means that the total gold imports this fiscal will not be over 550 tonnes. It was 845 tonnes in the last fiscal.###4043||Why did this happen?

The US Federal Trade Commission has opened a civil investigation into Herbalife, AFP reports according to the nutritional products marketer.Herbalife, which has been accused for more than a year by activist investor William Ackman of running a pyramid scheme, said it was "confident" it would be vindicated."Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC," the company said."Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years."The investigation follows repeated criticism of the company by Ackman, head of hedge fund Pershing Square, who has described Herbalife as a scam that makes money by recruiting more distributors rather than selling nutritional products, diet food and other items to consumers.The activist's latest broadside came Tuesday when he accused Herbalife of extending the pyramid- scheme model to China, violating Chinese laws on recruiting and compensating sales staff in the process.The company's securities filings are "false and misleading" on China, he added.Herbalife, which has consistently denied Ackman's charges, said the latest Pershing Square attack "reflects Mr. Ackman's continued failure to fundamentally understand Herbalife's business model."Herbalife said it follows the law in China, where it "has established itself as a leading nutrition brand and legitimate direct-selling company."Ackman has reportedly bet more than $1 billion that shares of Herbalife would decline. Besides talking up his case to investors, he has lobbied lawmakers in Congress to scrutinize the company.He last year sparred in a joint television appearance with fellow billionaire Carl Icahn, who sharply criticized Ackman's arguments on the company. Icahn is the company's biggest investor with a 16.8 percent stake.Herbalife shares fell 7.4 percent to $60.57 after disclosing the probe.###4045||Empty###4046||Empty###4047||Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.

What: Shares of Chiquita Brands International, Inc. (UNKNOWN:CQB.DL) were looking ripe today, climbing as much as 19% after announcing a merger with Fyffes, a produce company based in Ireland.

So what: The merger will create a new company known as ChiquitaFyffes, 50.7% of which will be owned by Chiquita shareholders and the remaining 49.3% to be owned by Fyffes shareholders, though the two brands will continue to operate separately. The companies said the combination would create the No. 1 banana company globally, with a 14% market share, and would lead to $40 million in annual cost savings and synergies and allow further opportunities to improve operational leverage.

Now what: The deal will be subject to the usual regulatory scrutiny, but analysts expect the merger to go through as the companies primarily deal in different parts of the world, Chiquita in North America and Fyffes in Europe. Investors on both sides clearly seem to approve of the merger as Fyffes' shares jumped 44% on the news, but several analysts said the deal is reflective of weakness in the industry and could prompt further consolidation. Merging two corporate cultures is also sometimes rougher than expected. Chiquita and Fyffes expect the deal to close by the end of the year.###4048||Comcast is sparing no expense to swallow Time Warner Cable. In addition to the $45 billion it will spend to expand its waistline from coast to coast, Comcast has padded the pockets of nearly every lawmaker responsible for overseeing the telecom giant's bid. According to a Politico investigation, the company has directed millions of dollars to lawmakers through its political action committee and donations to charitable causes and groups, and millions more on lobbying them.

Politico reports that 15 of the 18 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold a hearing on the Comcast deal on March 26th, have taken some form of contribution from Comcast. In the House Judiciary Committee, where a similar hearing will take place, 32 of the 39 members have received some kind of donation. And Comcast hasn't been shy about its influence; a recent BusinessWeek report illustrated the company's brazen presence on Capitol Hill, including vodka and s'more-fueled bonding sessions between congressional aides, administration officials, Olympic athletes, and Comcast's chief lobbyist.

Vodka, s'mores, and political favor

This behavior is completely expected. Comcast is a huge donor and lobbying spender in most years, and made a similar push in its successful bid for NBCUniversal, which was arguably more pernicious for consumers than its Time Warner buyout. If Congress bending to the will of America's largest corporations is a tired political trope, it's because of companies like Comcast, AT&T, and other telecommunications giants that have pervasively dominated nationwide lobbying over the past century.

Comcast says it's just participating in democracy. In a statement emailed to The Verge, Comcast VP of Government Communications Sena Fitzmaurice writes that "it is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers." Of course, that's basically just an admission that Comcast tries to wield influence in the places it does business.

America's telecom giants have a legacy of lobbying Washington for profit-seeking, anti-consumer protections. AT&T, which has the pedigree of a major American monopoly, is legendary in Washington; the company sought revenge after losing its T-Mobile bid and continues to seed bills in Congress that would cripple the Federal Communications Commission. Verizon and Comcast have sought to keep agreements that would effectively eliminate cable companies from the field of wireless competition hidden from public scrutiny. And these companies say they support the principles of net neutrality even as they fought to dismantle it.

Pure and simple, Comcast's latest spending spree in Congress is nothing more than legalized bribery. But it's hard to blame it for using strategies that have been so successful for decades. Why compete when you can pay to win?###4049||No Comments

2014 Highlander Recall Issued to Repair Third Row Seat Belt Anchorage

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced a 2014 Toyota Highlander recall for models manufactured between November 20, 2013 and January 18, 2014. The 7,067 units involved may have an improperly installed third row middle seat belt that could result in a greater risk of injury during the crash.

Related: The 2014 Highlander Adds Personality

According to the NHTSA’s 2014 Toyota Highlander recall notice, the affected models’ third row middle seat belt assembly may not have been properly secured to the vehicle floor anchorage during vehicle assembly. This would mean that the third row middle seat belts do not adhere to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 210, “Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages.” In laymen’s terms, a seat belt that is not properly secured to its anchorage is ill-equipped to protect in the event of a crash, and the Highlanders in question may put occupants at greater risk for injury should an accident occur.

To remedy the situation, Toyota will notify owners of the affected Highlanders, and dealers will subsequently offer free inspections of the third row middle seat belt anchor. Should the equipment be found to be faulty, repairs will be made free of charge.

2014 Highlander owners may contact Toyota at 1-800-331-4331; owners may also contact the NHTSA through their Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or by visiting www.safercar.gov.

Reuters

A Comcast sign is shown on the side of a vehicle. A combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable company would cover just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market and about 33 percent of the high-speed Internet market. (Reuters)

— Media companies plan to press Comcast Corp. for higher fees in the coming year, seeing an opportunity to squeeze better terms from the cable company as regulators review its planned takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc.Comcast and Time Warner Cable paid nearly $14 billion to content companies last year for rights to distribute their films, television shows and sporting events.Broadcasters and cable television networks have “assignment clauses” in their contracts with Time Warner Cable that require the networks to sign off before Comcast can merge the two cable operators’ agreements, according to people who have negotiated agreements in the past.Media executives say most programmers will push for higher rates in return for expanding their deals to cover digital distribution of their content.“Media companies selling programming can be expected to leverage the policy and politics surrounding the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger to extract sizeable and unusual concessions,” said Jimmy Schaeffler, chairman of pay TV consultant firm The Carmel Group.Comcast is expected this month to formally request a Federal Communications Commission review of the $45.2 billion Time Warner Cable deal. The combined company will control almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market and about a third of the high-speed Internet market.While content providers are broadly concerned about the long-term negotiating clout of the new company, many of them are looking for immediate ways to benefit from the merger, according to media executives who requested anonymity because their negotiations with Comcast will be private.Media companies see increased value for their content following a recent deal by satellite operator Dish Network Corp. to pay Walt Disney Co. for the rights to stream ESPN, ABC and other programs over the Internet.Analysts say Disney likely pocketed higher subscriber fees from Dish for channels such as ESPN and Disney Channel. In 2013, ESPN was paid an industry average fee of $5.54 per subscriber per month, while Disney Channel received $1.15 per subscriber per month, according to SNL Kagan.CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves hinted at an investor conference this week that he would push for better terms from Comcast. “There’s going to be a lot of discussions going on about how you get those two contracts together,” he said, referring to the two companies’ licensing agreements.Comcast now pays the industry’s lowest rates because of its size. Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus has dismissed the notion that the merged company will bully programmers.“I just find that whole line of concern to be totally ironic,” he said, “given the experience that we have all had over the last dozen years or so where programming costs have risen at a level that far exceeds the price that customers will actually bear.”

In the U.S., the coming week looks set to be a quieter one for economic news, following Friday's strong-than-expected payrolls.

"The 175,000 rise in U.S. payroll employment in February, which followed an average rise of 115,000 in the previous two months, is all the more impressive since activity was clearly hampered by the unusually severe weather," said Paul Dales of Capital Economics in a research note.

Few companies will report earnings on Monday, although Urban Outfitters (URBN) is due to post quarterly numbers after Wall Street closes.

###4053||###4054||Singapore: Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 4-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal`s safe-haven appeal.

Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at USD 1,355 an ounce, traders said.

Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing over 1 percent.

"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.

"It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said.

"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold`s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets."

Spot gold had gained 0.6 percent to USD 1,357.11 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after earlier hitting USD 1,359.25 - its highest since October 29. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday.

Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.

Ukraine`s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days.

China`s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world`s second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of USD 500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

PHYSICAL MARKETS

Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices.

In China, the world`s biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about USD 3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of USD 20.

Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce.###4055||###4056||There were 4.0 million job openings on the last business day of January, little changed from December. The hires rate (3.3 percent) and the separations rate (3.2 percent) also were little changed in January. The annual levels and rates for 2013 are now available.

There were 4.0 million job openings on the last business day of January, little changed from December,

the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The hires rate (3.3 percent) and separations rate (3.2

percent) were little changed in January. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job

openings, hires, and separations for the nonfarm sector by industry and by geographic region. The

release also includes 2013 annual estimates for hires and separations. The annual levels for hires and

quits increased in 2013 while the annual total for layoffs and discharges decreased.



Job Openings



There were 4.0 million job openings in January, little changed from December. The number of openings

also was little changed in total private and government. The number of job openings decreased in retail

trade; the number increased in health care and social assistance and in arts, entertainment, and

recreation. The West region experienced a rise in job openings in January. (See table 1.)

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

| Revisions to the JOLTS Data |

|Job openings, hires, and separations data have been revised from December 2000 forward to |

|incorporate annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics employment estimates and the Job |

|Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) seasonal adjustment factors. In addition, durable |

|goods manufacturing and nondurable goods manufacturing data are now available on a seasonally |

|adjusted basis. See the note at the end of this release for more information about these changes. |

|__________________________________________________________________________________________________|



The number of job openings (not seasonally adjusted) increased over the year for total nonfarm and total

private but decreased for government. Over the year, the number of job openings increased in several

industries while it decreased in real estate and rental and leasing and in federal government. The

Midwest and West regions experienced an increase in the number of job openings over the 12 months

ending in January. (See table 7.)



Hires



There were 4.5 million hires in January, little changed from December. The number of hires was

essentially unchanged for total private and government. The number of hires fell in January in retail

trade and in the Midwest. (See table 2.)



Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of hires (not seasonally adjusted) changed little for

total nonfarm, total private, and government. Hires levels rose over the year in professional and business

services and in educational services. The number of hires was little changed in all four regions. (See

table 8.)



Separations



Total separations includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Total separations is

referred to as turnover. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. Therefore,

the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers’ willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and

discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations include separations

due to retirement, death, and disability, as well as transfers to other locations of the same firm.



There were 4.5 million total separations in January, little changed from December. The number of total

separations was essentially unchanged for total private and government. (See table 3.)



In January, the quits rate was little changed at 1.7 percent for total nonfarm. The rate was little changed

for total private (1.9 percent) and unchanged for government (0.6 percent). The quits rate was essentially

unchanged over the month in all industries and in all four regions. (See table 4.)



The number of quits (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the 12 months ending in January

for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of quits rose over the year in retail trade

and professional and business services but fell in finance and insurance. The number of quits was

essentially unchanged in all four regions over the year. (See table 10.)



The layoffs and discharges rate was little changed in January at 1.3 percent. The rate was unchanged

over the month for total private (1.4 percent) and government (0.5 percent). The layoffs and discharges

rate was little changed in all four regions. Seasonally adjusted estimates of layoffs and discharges are

not available for individual industries. (See table 5.)



The layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the 12 months ending

in January for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of layoffs and discharges rose

over the year for several industries but fell in mining and logging. The number of layoffs and discharges

rose in the Midwest. (See table 11.)



In January, there were 341,000 other separations for total nonfarm, little changed from December. The

number of other separations also was little changed over the month for total private and government.

(See table 6.) Seasonally adjusted estimates of other separations are not available for individual

industries or regions. Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of other separations was little

changed for total nonfarm, total private, and government. (See table 12.)



Net Change in Employment



Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net

employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of

hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining.

Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even

if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in January 2014, hires totaled 54.3

million and separations totaled 52.1 million, yielding a net employment gain of 2.2 million. These

figures include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year.



Annual Levels and Rates



This release contains the 2013 annual levels and rates for hires, total separations, quits, layoffs and

discharges, and other separations. Note that annual figures for job openings are not calculated because

job openings are measured on a stock, or point-in-time, basis rather than on a flow basis over a specified

time period. The annual figures and additional tables are published with the release of January data each

year. (See the Technical Note for additional information on these measures.)



Calculating annual levels and rates allows additional comparisons across years. In 2013, annual levels

for hires, quits, and other separations rose for the fourth consecutive year. The layoffs and discharges

annual level decreased in 2013 after holding steady in 2012.



In 2013, annual hires increased to 54.2 million (39.7 percent of employment) and annual total

separations rose to 51.8 million (38.0 percent of employment). Annual quits increased to 27.6 million

(20.3 percent of employment) in 2013. Annual layoffs and discharges decreased in 2013 to 20.0 million

(14.6 percent of employment). Annual other separations rose in 2013 to 4.3 million (3.1 percent of

employment). (See tables 13 through 22.)

____________

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey results for February 2014 are scheduled to be

released on Tuesday, April 8, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. (EDT).

NOTE: Data have been revised to incorporate the annual updates to the Current

Employment Statistics employment estimates and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment

factors.





Revisions to Job Openings and Labor Turnover Data



In accordance with annual practice, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data have

been revised to reflect annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics (CES), or establishment

survey, employment estimates. The JOLTS employment levels (not published) are ratio-adjusted to the

CES employment levels, and the resulting ratios are applied to all JOLTS data elements. In most years,

this annual benchmark process would result in the revision of 21 months of not seasonally adjusted data.

However, this year the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (the sampling frame for both

JOLTS and CES) reclassified some home services for the elderly and people with disabilities from

NAICS 814110 (out of scope for JOLTS and CES) to NAICS 624120 (in scope for JOLTS and CES).

This reclassification, though not large, required a retabulation of the full JOLTS series from December

2000 forward. Additionally, new seasonal factors have been developed based on the full revised JOLTS

series and have been applied to the data from December 2000 forward. (For more information on this

year’s CES benchmark and the reclassification of jobs, see http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesbmart.pdf.)



Tables B through G below present revised total nonfarm data for January through December 2013. The

December 2013 revisions also reflect the routine incorporation of additional sample receipts into the

final December estimates. Tables presenting revisions to total nonfarm data for December 2000 through

2012 will be available later today on the JOLTS website. The website also contains all revised

seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted data. The revision tables and data can be accessed

through the JOLTS homepage at http://www.bls.gov/jlt/.

Though enrollment has surged by about 800,000 since the end of February, the administration’s latest figure is not a clear estimate of how many people have actually gained coverage through the exchanges since it doesn’t include who has paid for their plans.

Last week, Politico reported that four of the country’s largest insurance companies said about 20 percent of people who signed up for Obamacare had not paid their first months premiums—meaning they should not be counted in the total enrollment numbers.

If this is correct, actual enrollment would be around 4 million, or 3 million shy of the White House’s original goal of signing up 7 million people this year.

The latest figures come two weeks before the March 31 deadline to sign up for health coverage through the exchanges. Under the law’s individual mandate, Americans who don’t have health insurance by April 1 will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income, unless they apply for a hardship exemption.

People can qualify for the exemption if they are experiencing a financial hardship that could make it difficult to obtain health coverage. The administration announced an extension of the exemption through 2016 last week. Critics say it could make it easier for people to skirt around the new requirement, and it can also make people less likely to get coverage.

Though they are still far from reaching their enrollment projections, administration officials are touting the numbers as a success, and say they are confident that sign ups will continue to surge ahead of the open enrollment deadline.

"The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -- the busiest day since December 23 -- and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend,” Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in a blog published Monday.

Another important question the figures do not answer is how many of the new enrollees previously lacked health coverage. This is important since a key goal of the healthcare reform law was to extend access to coverage for the millions of uninsured Americans. One independent study by McKinsey found that just 27 percent of total enrollment through February were previously uninsured.

If this is accurate, the majority of people signing up for Obamacare either had an employer plan previously and were kicked off, or they found a better deal on the exchanges.

Yet the currency moved in a relatively narrow range reflecting market views that the People’s Bank of China will seek to limit currency swings at a time when markets fret over China’s cooling growth and the quality of corporate debt.

“The PBOC, with the help of major state-owned banks, will for certain tighten the grip on yuan’s value in coming days and weeks to prevent what it sees excessive volatility,” said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai.

In the longer run, however, the central bank is expected to allow the currency to move in a broader range in a sign of its confidence that it can keep speculators at bay and that the economy was mature enough to handle greater uncertainty about the exchange rate.

“Over time, the widening will pave the way for the PBOC to gradually lessen intervention in daily trading and will help China’s reforms to make the yuan fully convertible eventually.”

On Saturday, the People’s Bank of China doubled the yuan’s daily trading range, so that it can now rise or fall 2 percent around the daily mid-point rate. The currency opened at 6.15 to the dollar, just 0.29 percent to the weaker side of the official mid-point rate. It briefly fell to an intraday low of 6.1642, 0.2 percent weaker than Friday’s close.

Since the start of this year the yuan has lost 1.8 percent against the dollar, largely as a result of the central bank’s efforts, reversing much of last year’s near 3 percent rise as Beijing sought to change the perception the yuan was a safe one-way appreciation bet.

Beijing’s efforts to clamp down on such trades combined with concerns over China’s economic health are expected to keep the yuan on the back foot in coming weeks.

LITTLE UPSIDE

Earlier this month, a Chinese company became the first to default on a corporate bond, and concerns about economic growth were highlighted by a dramatic 18 percent fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing.

“Given China’s recent relatively weak export performance, we see little upside for the yuan this coming year,” said Tao Wang, an economist at UBS in Hong Kong.

The Bank of International Settlements data underscore that point showing the yuan at a record high against a basket of currencies of China’s trading partners adjusted for inflation.

Yuan non-deliverable forwards, that reflect bets on future currency performance, are implying a nearly 1 percent drop over the next 12 months compared with half a percent fall in December.

But China will be careful to temper expectations of more yuan weakness to prevent capital outflows at a time when the economy is facing headwinds.

A series of weak economic surveys made some economists predict that Beijing will struggle to meet its 7.5 percent growth target this year, which it itself would be already the weakest in 24 years.

China’s new leadership has signalled greater tolerance for more pedestrian growth as the necessary price for its intended rebalancing away from rapid investment- and export-driven expansion towards more sustained development.

Giving markets more leeway in setting the exchange rate is part of a broad reform plan that also includes freeing up interest rates, allowing private investment in protected sectors and cutting red tape. But Beijing has also made clear it was ready to act if the economy lost traction too quickly to preserve economic and social stability.

RENMINBI TO RISE

However, in the longer run, the yuan could still find support in China’s sizeable current account surplus and its massive $3.8 trillion currency reserve war chest.

That also chimes in with Beijing’s efforts to boost the yuan’s use in international trade. In recent months, it has opened new offshore yuan hubs in London, Singapore and Taiwan and relaxed restrictions for investors seeking yuan assets.

More than a sixth of China’s trade is now denominated in the yuan compared to less than 1 percent four years ago and analysts expect this share to double over the next two to three years.

A band widening is also seen as a precursor to a fully floating currency which would be a big step towards the yuan, also referred to as renminbi, becoming an international reserve asset.

“Any short term weakness that may occur would provide investors a good opportunity to reallocate away from the currencies of more indebted countries in favor of the Renminbi,” said Andy Seaman, fund manager at London-based fixed income fund Stratton Street Capital.

Dealers said the central bank’s mid-point level fixed 0.04 percent firmer than Friday’s level and Monday’s opening trades suggested it was Beijing’s intention to keep markets guessing about where yuan would be heading.

“These rates are the first signs that the band widening may not point to any certain direction of yuan depreciation or appreciation,” said a dealer at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai.

Reflecting that heightened uncertainty, one-month implied dollar/yuan volatilities traded in the offshore market, perhaps the clearest indicator of how volatile the Chinese currency is expected to be over the next month, hit a record before easing slightly.

Although the company is little-known in the U.S., it is expected to rank among the largest ever initial public offerings. Alibaba is reportedly expected to raise as much as $15 billion.

That puts it just shy of Facebook (FB), whose 2012 IPO was the third-largest at $16 billion. Alibaba, like Facebook, is already profitable. (See correction below.)

Alibaba's long-awaited decision was revealed Sunday after months of negotiations with Hong Kong stock authorities. The company had said a major sticking point was its proposed governance structure.

Alibaba's announcement included a reference to that issue: "We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong."

But the decision for a U.S.-based IPO "will make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.

Many significant questions about the IPO remain unanswered, including when the offering could be made, who the major banks behind the IPO will be and whether it would list on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.

As recently as Friday, Alibaba said it had "no timetable" for an offering and "no underwriters."

The company is sometimes described as China's Amazon or eBay, and its online marketplace is a mix of both. It operates an Amazon-like online shopping mall, a eBay-like venue for individuals to buy from other people, a business-to-business sales platform and a PayPal-like online payment platform.

One of its largest single investors is U.S.-based Yahoo (YHOO), although Alibaba recently bought back a significant portion of Yahoo's stake.

Weibo, China's Twitter (TWTR), also recently announced plans for a U.S. IPO. On Friday, the social media giant said it would list on the New York Stock Exchange and seek to raise $500 million.

GM, the largest US automaker, is now at the beginning of a potentially years-long road dotted with inquiries, lawsuits, government fines and public skepticism. Besides the US justice department probe, GM must answer to Congress, the transportation department and lawyers the company hired to investigate itself.

Toyota Motor Corp. is still being examined over recalls in 2009-10 related to reports of unintended acceleration in some cars. GM similarly faces repercussions for waiting to recall 1.6 million vehicles last month, even though records show it was aware as far back as 2004 of ignition switches that could slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. The crisis arrives weeks after Mary Barra took over as chief executive officer amid rising investor and consumer optimism as GM shook off the last vestiges of its 2009 bankruptcy.

Barra is getting her feet thrown right into the fire, Dave Sullivan, an industry analyst with Southfield, Michigan- based AutoPacific Inc., said in an interview. “There’s no way she is going to come out of this looking like some kind of hero. The best thing is to be honest and upfront and hopefully put this to bed as quickly as possible.”

A spokesman for Detroit-based GM, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Martin said March 10 the company was cooperating with regulators and lawmakers and that it welcomed the opportunity to help parties have a full understanding of the facts.

Consumer lawsuits

GM tumbled 5.1% to $35.18 on Tuesday, its worst one- day share drop at the close since March 2012.

“While the immediate financial impact of GM’s recall of Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5s and other vehicles is insignificant, some hard-to-quantify reputational risk is emerging, Joseph Spak, an RBC Capital Markets LLC analyst,” said in a note to investors on Tuesday.

“Remember while this was old (pre-bankruptcy) GM, the consumer won’t differentiate,” Spak said. “It does appear that GM employees have known about the risk for a while, so it does seem there is a failure to act somewhere along the way.”

New legal activity is already bubbling. Todd Walburg, a personal-injury lawyer with Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP, said his firm began looking into GM’s ignition switches in mid-February. Walburg said the firm has been contacted by more than 200 people about the issue in the past week.

Higher stakes

It wasn’t possible to verify that number and Walburg declined to say whether GM’s initial recall announcement on February 13 initiated the firm’s investigation or how it generated inquiries. A Google search for GM recall and GM ignition switch pulls up a sponsored ad that links to Lieff Cabraser, which also represented plaintiffs in some of the Toyota incidents.

The Justice Department’s preliminary investigation raises the stakes considerably. Federal prosecutors will look at how the company handled the recalls, focusing on whether GM violated criminal or civil laws by failing to notify regulators in a timely fashion about the switch failures, according to a person familiar with the investigation who asked not to be identified discussing an open inquiry.

The chaos from the recall and the multiple investigations hits just as GM had finished shaking off the Government Motors stigma tied to the $49.5 billion US bailout that saved the automaker from liquidation.

The same week in mid-December that the government sold its last shares in the automaker, GM said it would promote Barra to CEO, the first woman to lead a major automaker. GM shares reached a post-bankruptcy high of $41.53 on December 17. Since then the shares have tumbled 15% through Tuesday.

Improving reputation

GM’s reputation with consumers had also been improving as it brought to market 18 new or updated cars and trucks, transforming its lineup into one of the freshest in the industry from one of the oldest. It also boosted quality to record levels, according to reviewers including J.D. Power & Associates and Consumer Reports magazine.

Its latest version of the Chevrolet Impala was the first US car chosen as the best sedan on the market by Consumer Reports, a first in at least 20 years, and the Cadillac CTS was picked as Motor Trend’s Car of the Year for 2014.

The justice department investigation is now stealing some of that spotlight. Federal prosecutors decided to start its GM probe after discussions with officials at the Transportation Department, according to another person familiar with the inquiry who asked not to be identified.

Congressional probe

“We are in communication with the department of justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM’s recall,” said Ryan Daniels, a Transportation Department spokesman. “ Our timeliness investigation and our efforts to ensure GM makes consumers aware of the steps they should take in response to the recall are currently our top priorities.”

The US attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York is leading the investigation. James Margolin, a spokesman for that office, declined to comment, as did Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington.

GM has hired Jenner & Block LLC Chairman Anton Valukas, who probed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 downfall, to help lead an internal investigation.

Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday asked Barra for documents and field reports related to the recall. Committee Chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, said March 10 that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks to explore whether GM or NHTSA missed something that could have flagged these problems sooner.

2004 complaints

The initial recall on February 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s. It was widened less than two weeks later by more than 800,000 additional vehicles. Those include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstices and 2006-2007 Saturn Skys. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.

NHTSA, whose decision not to investigate the switch failures years ago is also under scrutiny by Congress, is focusing on what steps GM took to investigate and rectify engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating back to at least 2004. GM has until April 3 to answer questions posed by NHTSA in a 27-page order issued last week.

Company documents show that between 2004 and the decision to initiate the recall, layers of GM engineers and corporate committees analysed and failed to fix the ignition flaw.

$35 million fine

GM has said that heavy key rings or jarring can cause the ignition switches to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. The automaker has linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including 13 deaths.

NHTSA could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the US, if it finds the automaker didn’t pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective.

Sean Kane, president of Safety Research & Strategies Inc., who researches product hazards and frequently works with plaintiffs’ attorneys, said the ignition-switch defect wasn’t obvious enough to trigger early-on, widespread investigations by trial lawyers.

“Unless there’s some reason to examine that further, a lot of crashes just go as unremarkable events,” said Kane, who testified during 2010 congressional hearings on Toyota. “With the product recall, now everyone’s taking a look back.” BLOOMBERG###4079||Empty###4080||The key question regarding the first monetary policy meeting of the Federal Reserve System in the Janet Yellen era on Tuesday and Wednesday is whether the central bank will change its guidance about zero interest rates, and how.

The problem is that the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7 percent, near the 6.5 percent threshold that the Fed set more than a year ago as the "threshold" for considering rate increases.

It's clear, however, that the economy and labor market are weaker than that headline 6.7 percent unemployment rate suggests, and that Yellen and company don't want to tighten monetary policy yet (they haven't even finished tapering the monthly bond purchases intended to add stimulus).

In recent months, the Fed's monetary policy statement has specified that it will keep rates near zero until "well past the time" when unemployment falls to 6.5 percent. With Wednesday's scheduled policy announcement, it's expected that Yellen might drop the reference to the interest rate entirely, and instead adopt a qualitative benchmark for raising rates that will more clearly spell out when the Fed might tighten. What that guidance might be, however, remains to be seen.

Congress is out of session this week, but one major legislation initiative that will spur conversation is the bill text for housing finance reform released Sunday by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and ranking member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho.

The Johnson-Crapo bill is similar in its broad outlines to another bipartisan bill introduced by members on the committee. With the support of the committee's top members, the measure could become the baseline for whenever a real legislative push is possible, likely in a subsequent Congress.

On Tuesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report on inflation through February with its release of the Consumer Price Index. Inflation was running at 1.6 percent year-over-year in January, according to the CPI, in both the headline number and excluding food and energy. Fed officials will be looking for inflation to tick up toward their 2 percent target. Reports on housing starts and sales and industrial production are also scheduled for this week.###4081||An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has set a new Guinness World Record for Most Valuable Life Insurance Policy. Worth $201 million, the deal involves 19 different insurance companies and will see the billionaire paying annual premiums in the low digit millions.

SG, LLC, a Santa Barbara, California-based advisory firm which sold the record-breaking insurance policy was not legally permitted to disclose the name of the billionaire buyer but said it was a well-known Californian tech investor.

That does not narrow the list. By our last count, California boasts 111 billionaires with more than a third of them in tech, while San Francisco has 20 billionaires alone, reports my colleague Dan Alexander. (Though if one were to take a shot in the dark, the seemingly arbitrary $201 million is, coincidentally, the same amount Elon Musk's SolarCity IPO filed for in 2013.)

This policy more than doubles the previous record set by Peter Rosengard from the UK, whose insurance on the life of a U.S. entertainment industry figure sold for $100 million.

Some might question why a billionaire would take out life insurance when he or she has so many other assets.

"In California, there are state death taxes that are exceptionally high," explained Dovi Frances, founder and managing partner of SG, LLC, on the phone from California."If your properties are leveraged then those loans are called immediately and need to be paid off," said Frances. "So if you want to head yourself against such a risk [your beneficiary] can receive the proceeds [from life insurance] without being exposed to taxes."

SG, LLC also offers asset management and investments for high-net-worth individuals. Founded in 2010, it has so far directly invested $240 million in technology and real estate, according to Frances. Clients pay SG a high-six figure annual fee for their services.

Bloomberg News Carl Icahn

Before the market opened, eBay EBAY, -9.06% filed a preliminary proxy statement calling upon its shareholders to reject Icahn’s two nominees for the e-commerce company’s board of directors at eBay’s next annual meeting. Ichan has nominated Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, to eBay’s board, as part of his efforts to get eBay to spin off its PayPal e-payments business as a separate company.

EBay also urged shareholders to vote for the current directors that are up for re-election: Fred Anderson, Edward Barnholt, Scott Cook and company Chief Executive John Donahoe.

And it was Donahoe, in particular, who was in Icahn’s sights on Monday.

In the latest of his colorful open letters to eBay shareholders, Icahn claimed that the “inexcusable incompetence” of Donahoe has cost eBay’s stock owners more than $4 billion, and based his views on Donahoe’s overseeing of the company’s sale of Skype to a private-equity consortium in 2009.

“Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners?” Icahn said. “But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards.”

EBay shares fell 1.4%, to close Monday at $58.22.

While eBay was in the red, Facebook Inc. FB, -0.25% rose more than 3%, to $72.03. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan raised his price target on the social-networking giant to $90 a share from $72. In a research note, Sheridan said that Facebook’s shares are a “snowball” that is picking up speed, in part from new advertising deals that are helping the company gain more traction with brands.

Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.78% ended the day with a gain of 48 cents a share to close at $530.92 after the company released iOS 7.1, the latest upgrade to its operating systems the iPhone and iPad. The newest version of iOS 7 comes with Apple’s new CarPlay technology that integrates iOS content with compatible automobiles.

Among other leading tech stocks, decliners were in the majority, as sector leaders such as IBM Corp. IBM, -1.01% Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.47% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.27% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.61% and Google Inc. GOOG, +0.98% retreated.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.24% managed to erase almost all of its early losses and dow by 1.7 points at 4,334 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, -1.22% also ended the day in the red.

If you are not among those who already have health coverage through an employer or privately obtained comprehensive health insurance, the March 31st deadline for signing up for health insurance is drawing near.

Under the federal Affordable Care Act, you must be covered this year or face a penalty of $95 per person or 1 percent of your income, whichever is higher. After the 31st, you won't be able to buy a health insurance plan again until the next open enrollment period begins on November 15th for coverage that will begin in 2015.

New York State of Health counsel Lisa Sbrana and Access Health CT CEO Kevin Counihan joined four other state exchange leaders on a conference call Thursday led by Families USA, a national nonprofit that advocates for the Affordable Care Act. Sbrana notes New York has conducted a thorough public awareness campaign. "We have additional e-mails tee'd up going out to folks letting 'em know, one, that they need to come in by March 31st to meet the open enrollment date, and, two, that if they don't they may face a tax penalty. So we are letting people know that and in our talking points when we're doing outreach events and out in the community we're also informing people. We want them to be aware of the consequences of not enrolling."

Sixteen insurance companies are represented on New York's official health insurance exchange website, NYStateofHealth.ny.gov. Sbrana noted that "In addition to the 615-thousand people that Urban Institute estimated that we would enroll through the full implementation of the ACA which takes us through 2016, they also estimated there were about 500-thousand people who would be eligible for our Medicaid program who were also uninsured. So we're focusing on both of those populations."

Figures for cumulative health enrollments through March 1 show the U.S. met 75 percent of its sign-up goal, with 13 states exceeding federal targets but the rest lagging.

Both the NY exchange website and Access Health CT have been spared the technical problems that plagued the federal site, HealthCare.gov. Connecticut's Kevin Counihan says while his state has also aggressively endeavoured to educate people about the penalties for failing to register, he doesn't expect a huge surge in enrollment in the coming weeks, and believes that over time, all qualifying individuals will voluntarily choose to participate. "Because of all the protections to the carriers and the fact that I think this is a three- to - four year implementation anyway, I think the most important thing for us to do as states is to get as many people in to these exchanges as much as possible, irrespective of demographic mix, to build a momentum for both growth and sustainability. My sense is and my experience has been that if we keep that momentum going, we're going to get the appropriate risk balance, just to the law of large numbers."

He adds 92 percent of Connecticut enrollees have come in through paid premiums. The federal government recently released statistics showing that 4.2 million people have purchased health coverage in plans sold through either the federal exchange or a state marketplace. The figure is about 2 million shy of the 6 million people the government had hoped to enroll by March 31st.###4086||Aust stocks set to open lower

The Australian stockmarket looks set to open lower after Wall Street finished mixed as a better-than-expected United States jobs report helped offset anxiety over Ukraine that sent European equities lower.

At 645am (AEDT), the March share price index futures contract was down 16 points at 5,456.

The monthly US jobs report said the economy added 175,000 jobs in February, an improvement after jobs growth had plummeted the previous two months.

But Ukranian tensions continued with a threat from Russian gas company Gazprom to halt deliveries to Ukraine.

No major local economic or equities news is expected on Monday.

In Australia, the market on Friday ended the week with a slight gain as investors remained unfazed by Russia's incursion into Ukraine and drew comfort from local economic data.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 16.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,462.3 points.

Mt Gox asks for court protection during Japan bakruptcy

15.35 Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo last month, started a related case in the US, blaming its failure on a software flaw in the digital currency.

Mt. Gox asked the US Bankruptcy Court in Dallas to protect any US-based assets the company may have while it tries to reorganize under the authority of the Japanese court. Mt. Gox last month said almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own were missing and were probably stolen.

“The facts known to date indicate that it was caused or related to a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, and ‘hacking’ attacks of one or more persons,” Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said in a sworn statement filed in Dallas.

The Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy in a Japanese court after losing Bitcoins worth about $473m at the time-about 7pc of all Bitcoins in existence worldwides.

The US bankruptcy case was filed partly to halt lawsuits against the company while it tries to reorganize in Japan and repay creditors. Last month, Mt. Gox was sued by an Illinois resident accusing it of misappropriation and fraud in federal court in Chicago.

Cyprus central bank governor resigns

15.17 Cypriot Central Bank governor Panicos Demetriades has submitted his resignation, which was accepted by President Nicos Anastasiades, an official statement said.

Reuters reported that the reason for his resignation was not immediately clear, but he has had testy relations with the centre-right government, and Anastasiades had said in September he was seeking his removal. Demetriades has been in his post for almost two years.

Demetriades represents Cyprus on the ECB governing council. The ECB had no immediate comment. A statement from Cyprus's presidency said Demetriades would work out his notice and step down on April 10.

Cyprus has released this statement:

The Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, Mr Panicos Demetriades, today submitted his resignation to the President of the Republic, Mr Nicos Anastasiades, and the resignation was accepted.

According to Mr Demetriades’ contract a month’s notice is required, and for that reason his resignation will be effective as of April 10. During this period, Mr Demetriades will deal with the pending issues before him and will brief his successor.

Mr Demetriades’ letter of resignation was handed today, in Brussels, to the Minister of Finance, Mr Harris Georgiades, in the presence of a European Central Bank representative.

The President of the Republic thanked Mr Demetriades for his contribution in the great effort that has been undertaken over the past year to rescue the country from bankruptcy and to stabilize the financial sector.

'Manly ice cream' in attempt to boost Cornetto sales

15.05 Ice cream cones and 99 flakes are in decline as consumers buy tubs and luxury brands, according to The Independent.

Gold core has the full details here.

14.06 Robert Cole, Reuters Breakingviews columnist, believes the deal between Fyffes and Chiquitais ripe for scrutiny.

It is hardly a mega-deal on the scale of AOL/Time Warner, but when it comes to fresh fruit, the $1bn merger of Fyffes and Chiquita is big bananas. If the combination goes ahead, the enlarged group will become a powerhouse for pineapples, melons and prepared salads, selling $4.6bn worth of produce every year. But as a banana behemoth, ChiquitaFyffes will face scrutiny before its creation is approved.

The terms give shareholders in North Carolina-based Chiquita 50.7pc of the new entity, with Fyffes, headquartered in Ireland, taking the rest. That bakes in a premium for Fyffes, which would otherwise naturally own 42pc of the group, pro-rata, for its contribution to the pair's $876m combined value using Friday's share prices.

What Chiquita shareholders lose in paying the premium, they should make back, and more, on the synergies. These are put at $40m annually before tax. Assume they have a net present value of $300m and the new group could be worth close to $1.2 bn.

The biggest potential banana skin is antitrust and the market is already wary. Shares in Fyffes were trading at 89 euro cents at the end of last week. They jumped to around 1.30 euros as the deal was outlined on March 10. The increase reflects the merger premium, but falls short of the full synergy value.

Icahn versus eBay

13.41 Investor Carl Icahn has written an open letter criticising eBay's chief executive and is calling for PayPaul to split from eBay.

eBay CEO John Donahoe oversaw a premature sale of Skype at a diminished price that resulted in eBay stockholders losing over $4 billion as compared to the sale of Skype to Microsoft 18 months later.

But Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of eBay, has hit back, accusing Mr Icahn of "making unsubstantiated claims about our company -- and deliberately impugning the integrity of our directors".

His letter is here and there are several other updates from the company here.

Khodorkovsky applies to settle in Switzerland

13.32 Former Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky has submitted a request to settle permanently in Switzerland, a spokeswoman said.

Once Russia's richest man, Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2003 for fraud and tax evasion. He was seen by many as a political prisoner, the highest-profile victim of President Vladimir Putin's campaign to rein in the "oligarchs" who had made fortunes snapping up assets in the chaotic years of Boris Yeltsin's rule following the collapse of Soviet communism. Khodorkovsky, who was released from a Russian prison camp near the Arctic Circle last December, has spent much of the last few months travelling.

The 50-year-old former oil tycoon was granted a three-month Schengen visa by Switzerland at the end of last year and arrived by train in Basel from Berlin at the start of January to take his two youngest sons back to school.

A spokeswoman for Khodorkovsky confirmed he had submitted a request for permanent residency in Switzerland, but she declined to give any further details on where exactly he was hoping to make his home.

Charlie Bean: bank keeping a 'beady eye' on roaring housing market

13.15 The Bank of England’s stability board is “keeping a beady eye” on Britain’s roaring property market, Charlie Bean has said, amid warnings that the economic recovery is too reliant on house prices and consumer spending.

Mr Bean, the deputy governor of monetary policy at the Bank, told the North East Chamber of Commerce that there were “unmistakable signs that a robust recovery is under way” in the UK. But he said that so far not enough growth was being built on the stable pillars of business investment, higher productivity and exports.

To date much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment,” he said.

He pointed out that last year consumer spending rose 2.2pc while housing investment jumped almost 10pc. See our full story here.

Gold trades below four-month high

13.07 Gold was little changed below a four-month high in New York as investors weighed the crisis in Ukraine against the case for the Federal Reserve to keep reducing stimulus

Gold posted a weekly gain of 1.3pc last week, even after dropping 1pc on March 7, as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated, boosting demand for a haven. Pro-Russian forces advanced in the Crimean peninsula, ignoring Western calls to halt a military takeover before the region holds a referendum on separation.

Bullion rose 11pc this year, rebounding from the biggest annual drop since 1981, even as the Fed announced a $10bn reduction to bond buying at each of its past two meetings, leaving purchases at $65bn.

12.30 Back in the stock market, Vodafone is a heavy faller, losing 2.7pc following reports the telecoms group has raised its bid for Spanish cable group Ono to €7bn. The wider FTSE 100, hindered by broad-based weakness among the mining shares, is now down 2 points at 6,710.

McDonald's sales drop

12.17 McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3pc in February as its US business slumped for the fourth straight month. Analysts had estimated a 0.1 pc decline.

McDonald’s, which has more than 14,200 US locations, has been trying to attract Americans by advertising coffee and breakfast foods. The Big Mac seller recently began testing raspberry pastries in San Diego stores as fast-food chains compete to lure diners amid shaky consumer confidence.

US sales in February were hurt by “severe winter weather,” the company said in the statement.

Malaysian Air shares at record low

11.55 Malaysian Airline System fell to an all-time low after the national carrier’s Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing two days ago.

The stock sank 4pc to 24 sen for its lowest close on record after falling as much as 18pc. It was the most active on Kuala Lumpur’s exchange with 385m shares traded. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index slid 0.6pc and the ringgit slumped 0.8pc against the dollar.

Investigators from nine countries are struggling to solve the mystery of the missing Malaysian jet, as Vietnamese forces today failed to find the airplane debris they had spotted yesterday off the country’s southern coast. The prospect of terrorism is being investigated after Austria and Italy said passports used by two male passengers were stolen from their citizens.

The great shard debate

11.31 Last week, the New York Times published a piece claiming that Britain's main business is laundering oligarch's dirty billions and London is a city where the uber-rich are celebrated "and migrants are exploited but that pretends to be a multicultural utopia".

Now, we probably shouldn't pay any attention to such groundless insults. We should probably hold our heads high and ignore it.

But... just for the fun of it, here's a very full rebuttal from Sean Thomas.

So there are no Slavic oligarchs living it up in the Shard. There are no naked hookers stretched out on tiger skins. There are no mile-high apartments full of trillionaire villains. There are no incomprehensible derivatives being traded beneath them. There are no elevators “full” of African cleaners – as the place is all but empty. So most of these “non-existent people” are, in point of fact, non-existent, which is probably why Londoners regard them as not existing.

Apart from that, great article.





Expect to see more food mergers?

11.17 Parmjit Singh, head of the food and drink group at Eversheds global law firm, believes the news of Fyffes and Chiquita banana companies merging is just a taste of things to come.

The news that Fyffes and Chiquita are merging will not come as a surprise. For many food producers this is a natural next step to meet the pressure to achieve cost efficiencies, improve shareholder returns and attract investment. Retailers have enjoyed strong negotiating positions over the last decade with food producers and these types of mergers are intended to help food producers to gain some parity on those negotations. As consumer confidence improves around the world, expect to see more of these types of mergers in the global food and drink sector.

Ukrainian tensions push corn trades to record highs

11.06 Russia’s incursion into Ukraine has led to concerns that corn supplies will be disrupted if tensions escalated, and has caused record options trading in a security that tracks corn.

Investors are piling into contracts on the Teucrium Corn Fund, which tracks US prices for the grain used in everything from motor fuel to soft-drink sweetener. A record of more than 16,000 call options giving the right to buy the exchange-traded fund changed hands last week as prices for bullish contracts rose to a three-year high compared with puts.

Joe Vaclavik, president of Standard Grain brokerage and consulting firm said:

Export demand has been very good.The Ukraine story has fueled the fire.

Zero-hours contracts rising

10.52 The ONS has admitted that 582,935 employees were on zero-hours contracts last year, more than double the 250,000 estimated by the Government in AUgust.

Zero-hours contracts are used in social care, retail and hotels, and mean the employees are not required to work a set number of hours and are only paid for hours worked.

But ONS has said the figures may change, as the question depends on employees correctly knowing their terms of employmenbt.

ONS's first employer-based estimates of zero-hours contracts are expected in April.

French industrial output unexpectedly falls

10.42 French industrial production unexpectedly fell for a second month and business confidence declined, indicating the recovery may struggle to build momentum this quarter.

Output dropped 0.2pc in January from December, led by electricity and gas production, the country’s statistics office in Paris said today. Economists had forecast a 0.3pc increase. A separate report showed an index of business sentiment declined to 98 in February from 99 the previous month.

Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in London, said:

The overall picture is less weak than headline figures suggest but France is certainly struggling to gain momentum. The French factory sector remains extremely fragile.

Unilver's majority stake in Chinese water company

10.27 Over the weekend, Unilver bought a majority stake in Qinyuan, a Chinese company that makes water purifiers and water treatment.

The world's second largest consumer goods company did not reveal the sum paid but said it was its biggest Chinese purchase in more than ten years.

Quartz has a report on why it's a sensible purchase.

It’s a smart move for a company whose business depends heavily on emerging markets like China that have proved volatile recently—Unilever makes almost 60pc of its sales in China and other emerging markets, compared to Procter & Gamble’s 39pc.

Water purification is one of the country’s most reliable consumer goods category, thanks to China’s persistent water pollution problems. An estimated 300m people, almost a quarter of the population, drink contaminated water on a daily basis. China’s expanding middle class doesn’t trust city water—and sometimes not even bottled water—and is splurging on home and office purification systems like those made by Qinyuan, which had sales of about $200m in 2013.

Tesco's finance director 'could leave within months'

10.05 Tensions between Tesco's finance director and chief executive mean that Laurie McIlwee, who has been Tesco's chief financial officer since 2009, could leave the company within months, according to Sky News.

Mark Klelnman reports that city investors have expressed doubts about Mr McIlwee, and there have been senior level discussions about his position since Tesco abandoned its key profit margin target last month.

Mr McIlwee is said to have an "uncomfortable working with relationship" with Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, according to Sky.

The change would be the latest upheaval for Tesco, who is facing strong competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl.

09.42 Back in the stock market, engine-maker Rolls-Royce is among the biggest risers, up 2.5pc after it was disclosed on Friday evening that it would buy-out Daimler’s 50pc stake in their power systems joint venture. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andy Chamber said:

The acquisition should be modestly accretive as RR generates little income from its cash and Rolls-Royce Power Systems contributed almost £300m to earnings before interest and taxes last year (15pc).

French central bank holds Q1 growth forecast at 0.2pc

09.13 The French economy is expected to grow by 0.2pc in the first quarter, the country's central bank said Monday, confirming a preliminary forecast issued a month ago.

The bank makes its forecasts based on a monthly survey of a panel of private sector executives, who have reported that business confidence remained largely unchanged in February.

The central bank noted that industrial production was "steady" across almost all sectors in February. This was particularly so in the chemical, pharmaceutical as well as machines and equipments industries.

"Deliveries are intensifying" while "the order books are filling out somewhat", said the bank which also expects business activity to improve slightly in March.

In the services sector, a "slight rise in activity" is seen in March.

Weak China data hits miners

09.04 Over in the FTSE 100, weak economic data from China - the world's biggest metals consumer - has hit mining shares, with Glencore Xstrata down 1.7pc, Anglo American off 1.6pc and Antofagasta 1.3pc lower. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at broker Interactive Investor, said:

China's 7.5pc growth target may only be a week old, but it is already under threat from some truly awful export numbers. The shock drop in exports raises serious questions about how realistic Chinese growth prospects are and casts doubt on their current target. This increased uncertainly is not helpful for either the commodity market or wider global equity markets.

Asian markets down

08.28 Asian stock markets are down, battered by weak Chinese trade and a reduced estimate for Japan's economic growth. Shares in Malaysia Airlines tumbled on news of the weekend disappearance of one its jets enroute to Beijing.

Japan's Nikkei closed down 1pc and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.75pc.

Markets were also down in Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.

Data released on the weekend showed China's exports fell by an unexpectedly large 18 pc in February, possibly denting hopes trade will help drive the slowing economy while communist leaders push ambitious reforms.

China's official 2014 economic growth target of 7.5pc, announced last week by Premier Li Keqiang, assumes trade also will grow by 7.5pc. But customs data show combined imports and exports so far this year have shrunk by 4.8pc.

08.15 Europe's main stock markets fell at the start of trading on Monday, with London's benchmark FTSE 100 index down 0.1pc.

Frankfurt's DAX 30 slid 0.48pc to 9,305.51 points and in Paris the CAC 40 dipped 0.08pc to 4,363.02 compared with Friday's closing values.

City briefing

08.09 Louise Armistead has rounded up some of the major business news this morning in her City Briefing email.

In company announcements today, Clarkson, the shipping services group, has announced a 12pc rise in full year revenues to £198m and a 26pc jump in underlying pre-tax profits.

GlaxoSmithKline, has increased its stake in its Indian subsidiary from 50.7pc to 75pc following a voluntary open offer.

Greggs has appointed two new non-executive directors, Peter McPhillips and Sandra Turner, to replace two retiring directors at the annual meeting in May. Armour Group has announced the disposal of its automotive division to AAMP of America for £10.9m. And Helical Bar has acquired two interlinked office building in Manchester for £34m.

Labour has announced that its "jobs guarantee" scheme for young unemployed people will be extended to cover the whole of the next election, should the party win in May 2015.

Under the scheme, 18 to 24 year olds who have been out of work for a year will be offered a tax-payer funded job for six months - which they will have to take or lose their benefits. The Tories reckon Labour's sums "don't add up" but Ed Balls has promised to use a bank bonus tax to pay for it.

Japan's deficit hits record as economic growth disappoints

07.30 Japan's current account deficit grew to a record 1.5trn yen (£8.7bn) in January, the largest since records began in 1985.

The deficit is far above estimates for a 1.4trn yen deficit as shipments failed to increase despite a weaker yen.

The country's fourth quarter growth was revised down with Japan's economy growing at an annual rate of just 0.7pc in 2013, below the estimates of 1pc.

The disappointing figures add to a recent run of soft indicators that have raised doubts about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's strategy to spark sustainable growth through massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as structural reforms.

"Abenomics" helped the economy grow above an annual clip of 4pc in the first half of last year - the best among advanced economies - but growth slowed to below 1pc in the second half as exports, capital spending and private consumption lagged.

The Bank of Japan began a two-day policy review today amid growing expectations the central bank will further ease policy as early as next month to steer the economy through some speed bumps.

Jen Maxfield reports. (Published Monday, March 10, 2014)

A veteran Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train in East Harlem early Monday, the latest in a series of accidents at the beleaguered commuter railroad.

The employee, 58-year-old James Romansoff, was working on the tracks near East 106th Street and Park Avenue when he was hit by a Poughkeepsie-bound Hudson Line train that left Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m., a Metro-North spokesman said.

The Yonkers man had spent eight years with the railroad's power department, and was part of a crew restoring power to tracks that had been closed for weekend maintenance work when he was hit.

Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the three dozen passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train. Service was restored before the morning rush.

"The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family," Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti said in a statement.

Metro-North authorities and MTA police are investigating, along with the National Transportation Safety Board.

Metro-North has been plagued with problems over the past year, including the death of a worker on the tracks in West Haven, Conn. last spring. In that case, the worker was hit by a train on a supposedly inactive section of track.

Also last spring, two trains collided during the evening rush in Connecticut, injuring more than 60 people.

And in December, a speeding train derailed in the Bronx, killing four people and injuring dozens more. The Federal Railroad Administration is expected to release its review of the December derailment in a week.

Six months before that derailment, a freight train hauling trash derailed on the same curve.

And in September, a feeder cable in Mount Vernon, N.Y., failed, knocking out power for 12 days on the Metro-North’s New Haven line, which carries 132,000 customers daily.###4093||Empty###4094||Empty###4095||Empty###4096||This is an archived article that was published on sltrib.com in 2014, and information in the article may be outdated.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to fast-track legislation expediting the federal approval process for liquefied natural gas export terminals, two dozen of which remain trapped in lengthy reviews inside the Energy Department. A hearing on the measure, introduced just last week, will be held later this month, committee sources said.

Republicans long have prodded the White House to speed up the process and take advantage of America’s abundance of natural gas by selling to allies in Europe and elsewhere. The issue has come into the spotlight in recent weeks as Russia strengthens its grip on the strategic Crimean peninsula, which will vote Sunday on seceding from Ukraine.

Russia provides more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas and about 30 percent of Europe’s supply, giving it key power over both its neighbor and nations such as Germany that the U.S. must have on board to enact meaningful economic sanctions against Moscow.

But the White House brushed off the notion that U.S. gas exports could have any impact on the current crisis in Ukraine.

“Any actions the United States can take with our own exports and how that would affect markets — that’s a complicated process and more of a long-term proposition,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. “But we certainly take the energy security of our friends in Europe very seriously.”

Mr. Carney also disputed the notion that Russia would cut off gas to Ukraine or Europe, saying Moscow must retain them as customers.

While it’s true that changing the global energy landscape would take years, the promise of American natural gas, even if its delivery is years off, would be reassuring, said Steven Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation.

“They wouldn’t have to be worried about Vladimir Putin turning the spigot the wrong way and cutting them off,” he said. “It would tell all these European countries we’re going to help you not be dependent on Russia, so they can’t hold this big stick over you anymore.”

A coalition of nations in central and eastern Europe, eager to end reliance on Russian fuel, is urging the U.S. to send a signal to Moscow that its days of using fuel as leverage are numbered.

“Our dependence on natural gas imports from a single supplier is still anywhere between 70 percent to 100 percent in the region … it is not hard to see that energy security remains to be a critical aspect of the region’s geostrategic stability and independence,” reads a joint letter that the ambassadors of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent last week to House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

“The presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in central and eastern Europe, and congressional action to expedite LNG exports to American’s allies would come at a critically important time for the region,” the ambassadors wrote.

The House legislation — the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act — would eliminate America’s “self-imposed restrictions” on exporting natural gas, now in abundance thanks to the perfection of the drilling technique known as fracking and the discoveries of vast fuel deposits in places such as the Marcellus Shale.

Energy companies have expressed a keen interest in selling the fuel to Europe and elsewhere, but federal rules and regulations require that any gas export project must be found to be in the nation’s best interest. The key component of that equation is whether exports would lower domestic supply and, in turn, raise prices in the U.S.

The administration thus far has approved six export terminals; 24 remain under consideration.

The House bill states that “any application for authorization to export natural gas … shall be granted without modification or delay.”

The Dow trimmed a loss of over 100 points earlier in the day, but still ended slightly in the red. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished flat.

The Dow and S&P 500 are near all-time highs as investors celebrated the five year anniversary of the current bull market.

But the Nasdaq is not back to all-time highs yet.

In fact, Monday is the 14-year anniversary of the tech-heavy index hitting its peak of above 5,130.

Still, the Nasdaq is now only about 15.5% below its dot-com boom record, thanks to a nearly 40% jump last year and strong start to 2014.

European markets closed mostly in the red. And Asian markets ended significantly lower after China trade data and revised Japanese GDP numbers came in weaker than expected.

Boeing (BA) shares fell after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777, disappeared Saturday in mysterious circumstances en route to Beijing. The company also announced late Friday that "hairline cracks" had been found on some of its Dreamliner 787 jets still in production.

King claims this will leave it with approximately $326 million in capital, after transaction costs, for corporate purposes and acquisitions, reports French news agency AFP. While this valuation is new, the IPO filing is not; London-based King announced its plans to go public nearly a month ago, and at the time the firm planned to raise up to $500 million.

King is one of the top publishers in the $16 billion mobile-gaming market. That sector is growing due in lare part to games like Candy Crush Saga. King’s revenues have grown tremendously thanks to puzzler, which has players trying to match three identical candies to score points. King earned $568 million in profit on revenues of $1.88 billion in 2013, and Candy Crush Saga — the top grossing iOS game of 2013 — is the driving force behind that. It w

The publisher does have other hits, but none that can keep up with Candy Crush. While the sugary megahit has 93 million daily active players (DAUs), the next closest King game, Pet Rescue Saga, only has 15 million daily users. This puts King’s valuation on potentially tenuous ground. In fact, the the company’s revenues declined from $621 million during Q3 of 2013 to $602 million in Q4, and it attributes that to “a decrease in Candy Crush Saga gross booking.”

King will have to prove that it can reproduce the success of Candy Crush Saga if it hopes to overcome the stigma that may surround social-gaming companies. In 2011, FarmVille publisher Zynga went public with a lot of buzz, but its share price quickly fizzled out.

“Much like the social-gaming sector, the mobile market can be just a volatile,” EEDAR vice president of insights Jesse Divinch told GamesBeat last year after rumors of the King IPO first surfaced. “Success with one game — or even a few — doesn’t mean it is sustainable long-term, as we’ve seen with Zynga.”

King’s advantage is that it is fully integrated on mobile platforms where the Farmville producer was reliant on Facebook for the bulk of its income. Of course, Candy Crush Saga is also now the No. 1 game on that social-networking site as well.###4101||20 Hours Ago

Colorado reaped more in taxes from cannabis than from alcohol in January after it became the first place in ­America to allow people to smoke pot purely for fun.

The state raised $2.1 million (£1.2 million) in taxes from recreational marijuana, and a further $1.4 million in taxes from sales of medicinal pot, which has been permitted since 2000. The ­total of $3.5 million easily exceeded the $2.7 million in alcohol taxes that the state garnered in January a year ago, the most recent comparable figure.

Recreational cannabis worth $14 million was sold across the state, with some vendors reporting that they had run out . “This is revenue directly out of the hands of cartels,” said Brian Vicente, a pro-cannabis activist.

The massive reorganization of the health-care sector presumed that 40 million (or 48 million, or 37 million) people lacked insurance all for the same reason — obstacles such as pre-existing conditions or economic hardship. A great many of those were either transitionally uninsured or uninsured by choice. Not surprisingly, a new survey shows that a significant number still don’t want to pay for health insurance, mandates notwithstanding:

A new report finds that one in three Americans who do not have health insurance plan to remain uninsured. According to the survey done by Bankrate.com, of the 34 percent who say they won’t purchase Obamacare, 41 percent said it was too expensive, 17 percent were against the Affordable Care Act and 13 percent said they were healthy enough not to need coverage. “It’s hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it’s a case of, ‘I’m in pretty good health, I don’t think about these things, I know I can’t afford it now,’” Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, told Bankrate.com. “I think it’s just rolling past them, and they’re not giving it a whole lot of attention.” Only 56 percent polled said they plan to purchase health insurance.

The article then quotes a researcher who thinks that the problem is that the White House didn’t emphasize the penalties hard enough. Well, it’s difficult to emphasize penalties when those keep getting delayed, especially by the same White House that would need to do the emphasizing. The penalty for the individual mandate is all but gone for tax years 2014 and 2015, thanks to the latest unilateral change coming from the Obama administration. Penalties that don’t penalize aren’t really all that motivating.

Besides, the survey itself makes it pretty clear that the refuseniks in this case aren’t making that decision out of sloth. More than 40% of them think ObamaCare is too expensive, and another 13% don’t see the need for comprehensive insurance, which is a majority who see the mandate as so cost-ineffective that it’s worth it to pay the penalty instead. Those are rational decisions, which a significant portion of the uninsured population made prior to ObamaCare, too.

How rational? Paul Bedard reports that an eHealthInsurance survey shows it to be a wise calculation (via Power Line):

According to a cost report from eHealthInsurance, a nationwide online private insurance exchange, families are paying an average of $663 a month and singles $274 a month, far more than before Obamacare kicked in. What’s more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called “bronze” plans. The firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system. In California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845. … — Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.

— The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.

This follows on sharp premium increases since the 2010 passage of ObamaCare, too, after the taxes and mandates for coverage began to kick in for insurers. Families are now spending almost $8,000 for an average policy, and that’s before the deductibles. They will have to spend thousands of dollars more before their benefits actually take effect. The same is true for individuals; at the above average, it’s about $3300 for premiums and thousands more in deductibles. So much for “bending the cost curve downward.”

Let’s remember that this market disruption was ostensibly created to entice all of these uninsured into the system. What rational reason do these costs give them to comply? It’s better to pay the fine and deal with routine care with out-of-pocket payments, then get insured late if a catastrophic event takes place.

Maybe, when we finally scrap this system, we’ll design one that offers real cost savings through open competition and reduced government rationing. In the meantime, no one can blame people for making rational choices, except of course this White House.###4109||Warning - there was an unexpected script error. Application may not work as expected.###4110||TRIPOLI (Reuters) - U.S. special forces have seized a tanker that fled with a cargo of oil from a Libyan port controlled by anti-government rebels, halting their attempt to sell crude on the global market.

Gunmen demanding regional autonomy and a share of oil wealth had managed to load the ship, which escaped Libya’s navy and triggered a crisis that prompted parliament to sack the prime minister.

A U.S. SEAL commando team boarded the tanker Morning Glory from a Naval special warfare rigid inflatable boat as it sat in international waters off Cyprus on Sunday night.

The seizure was approved by U.S. President Barack Obama and requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

No one was hurt in the under two hour operation, and no shots fired. Two AK47 rifles were found and the three Libyans holding the ship remained in U.S. control, a U.S. defence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained” from the Libyan port of Es Sider, Kirby’s statement said.

The standoff over Libyan oil and the tanker debacle have deepened the chaos testing Tripoli since the civil war that toppled Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.

With its army still nascent, a weak government has been unable to impose its will on former anti-Gaddafi fighters and militias who now use their military muscle to make demands on the state, often by targeting the vital oil sector.

At least in the short term, the tanker’s seizure by U.S. forces is likely to prevent any more attempted oil sales by the rebels, who in August took control of three export terminals accounting previously for 700,000 barrels a day of exports.

“Oil is the economy’s artery. The government will not allow anyone to fool around with the assets and resources of the Libyan people,” the Libyan government said in a statement.

It was the second time in six months that U.S. forces have become involved in Libya. A commando team snatched a suspected al Qaeda suspect off the street as he returned home from prayers in the capital Tripoli in September.

The Cypriot foreign ministry said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a U.S. military escort.

An American crew from the USS Stout, a guided missile destroyer, got the tanker underway toward Libya on Monday. The Stout voyage was expected to take up to four days, the officials said.

The Morning Glory had been North Korean-flagged, but the government in Pyongyang on Thursday said it had notified Libya and maritime authorities that it had severed all ties with the ship because of the vessel’s contraband cargo.

So Se Pyong, North Korea’s ambassador in Geneva, said on Monday he discussed the situation with his Libyan counterpart to explain, but not apologise for the situation.

He said North Korea did not buy oil from Libyan rebels, and since the Egyptian-based shipping firm had acting illegally he was not concerned about the U.S. Navy seizure.

“Whether it was captured by the Americans, or by someone else, if that ship was doing something wrong, then we don’t care,” So told Reuters.

There was no immediate reaction from the federalist rebels, based in eastern Libya.

Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said on Saturday his group was ready to negotiate an end to the port blockade, but the government needed to abandon plans to mount a military offensive.

But analysts said it was uncertain whether government troops would be able effectively to confront the heavily armed rebels, made up of soldiers who defected from an oil protection force.

LEAR JET TO CYPRUS

The tanker’s escape highlighted the weakness of government forces, which had claimed several times that the 37,000-tonne ship was under their control only for the vessel to slip into international waters after a firefight.

Still, the intervention gives a boost to the fragile Libyan government in its fight to impose order. The transition to democracy has been upset by tribal, regional and political disputes.

Western powers, worried that it might fracture or slide deeper into chaos, have been training Libyan armed forces and cajoling conflicting parties in government to reach a settlement, with little progress.

A successful sale of Libyan oil outside government control, though, was always going to be complicated for the rebels.

A Cypriot police source said three men - described as two Israelis and a Senegalese - were detained for questioning on Saturday on suspicion of attempting to buy the tanker’s cargo, but were freed after a court refused to issue an arrest warrant.

Two of the men carried diplomatic passports - one from Senegal and one from a central African country, the security source said.

The source said they flew a Lear Jet into Cyprus on Friday evening, chartered a vessel from a yachting marina in Larnaca and headed to the tanker.

“They spoke to somebody on board the vessel, then left. At Larnaca marina police called them in for questioning,” the source said. The men left for Tel Aviv after being freed.

The Libyan navy opened fire on a Maltese-flagged tanker trying to approach Es Sider in January, but analysts say a full military confrontation with the port rebels would be unlikely.

The government fears federalism might open the door for secession and similar protests by other regions, though the rebels say they do not want to break up Libya.

Tripoli faces a budget crisis as oil production has fallen to a little over 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 1.4 million bpd in summer when protests at oilfields and ports started.

London - Concerns over Chinese growth and political tensions in Ukraine took the fizz out of an attempted rally in riskier assets on Thursday, as world shares steadied after their biggest falls for nearly two weeks. Stock markets in Europe edged higher, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 percent to recoup some of its 1.1 percent drop in the previous session.

The move echoed trading in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan managed to rise 0.5 percent, clawing back half the previous day's losses.

Soft Chinese data dented many markets, however, with Japan's Nikkei slipping 0.1 percent, erasing gains made after Japanese machinery orders beat expectations, and South Korean shares also erasing most of its gains.

China's industrial output growth came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries that growth could slow as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.

“The China economy is slowing quite sharply, in our view... (although) the lack of inflation and slowing growth does open the door for policy easing,” Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said in a note.

The MSCI All-Country World index edged up 0.1 percent, not far from an eight-day low hit on Wednesday.

A major victim of concerns over China, copper dropped 0.9 percent to $6,448 a tonne, a day after it hit a four-year low at $6376.25.

After a tumble in copper of around 8 percent so far this month, investors are worried about a possible unravelling of Chinese loan deals using the metal as collateral.

EURO: A NEW SAFE HAVEN?

Traditional safe-haven assets remained firm even as stocks steadied, as the diplomatic stalemate between Russia and the West over Ukraine continued.

The European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.

Gold hit a six-month high of $1,374.85, while US Treasuries have erased all the losses made following last week's strong payrolls data.

The benchmark 10-year yield was 2.72 percent on Thursday versus its six-week high of 2.82 percent hit last Friday.

Geopolitical tension also supported oil.

The European benchmark Brent held relatively firm at $107.88 as it drew support from the unfolding crisis over Ukraine.

US crude futures steadied, although they remained near one-month lows hit on Wednesday after Washington announced a surprise plan for a test release of strategic oil reserves.

In the currency market, the Swiss franc hit a two-and-a-half year high of 0.8697 francs to the dollar, while the Japanese yen, which is under pressure from the Bank of Japan's loose monetary policy, also ticked up slightly.

The euro hit a new 2 1/2-year high of $1.3954, a possible sign that the currency is regaining safe-haven status as it recovers from the sovereign debt crisis.

Irish government bond yields hit new record lows before Dublin's first regular debt auction since its 2010 bailout, seen as a post-crisis watershed for the country.

Investors expected a solid auction result, which some said could be a catalyst for another leg in the Irish debt rally which has taken 10-year yields to just below 3 percent from a peak of over 15 percent in 2011.

“This return to domestic bond auctions is the final stage of Ireland regaining full access to capital markets,” said Sandra Holdsworth, an investment manager at Kames Capital.

“We expect Thursday's auction to pass successfully... However, one note of caution: at current levels of yield there is little margin to protect investors should the economic outlook worsen or fiscal discipline be lost.” - Reuters###4112||Empty###4113||A PIMCO trustee told the LA Times that billionaire bond guru Bill Gross is overpaid.

From the LA Times' Scott Reckard:

"You could hire 2,000 schoolteachers for that money," said William J. Popejoy, a former financial executive who has been a Pacific Investment Management Co. trustee for 23 years. "I don't know what Bill should be paid, but $200 million is not appropriate."



Last month, Gross was the subject of an incredibly unflattering Wall Street Journal article

The inside account detailed how Gross had a nasty clash with Mohamed El-Erian in front of the other employees. El-Erian, PIMCO's CEO/co-CIO, abruptly resigned from PIMCO in January.

Sources also told the Journal that Gross referred to himself as "Secretariat," the legendary undefeated racehorse. The article also said that Gross doesn't let his traders make eye contact with him or speak to him in the morning.

Popejoy slammed Gross over the WSJ article in an interview with the LA Times:

"I don't know if Secretariat made $200 million a year," Popejoy said.

He described Gross' recent performance as "mediocre" and characterized the description of his management style as "bullying, if what I read is true."###4114||Empty###4115||Empty###4116||###4117||Empty###4118||OK

Industrial production rose 8.6 percent from a year earlier in the January-February period, down from the pace of 9.7 percent in December of last year.

Fixed-asset investment increased 17.9 percent to 3.02 trillion yuan (US$491 billion) during the two-month period, slowing from a 19.6 percent rise during all of 2013.

Also, retail sales gained 11.8 percent year on year in the first two months, a surprising moderation from the jump of 13.6 percent in December.

Together with the trade data released on Saturday, nearly all indicators at the start of this year suggested that China's growth momentum has continued to slow down, analyst said.

Zhou Hao, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, said the GDP growth in the first half of 2014 will likely be below 7.5 percent, which could trigger further policy easing in the foreseeable future.

China's exports slumped 18.1 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, worse than expected even taking seasonal factors into consideration, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.

A bit earlier, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said the country's manufacturing activity grew at the slowest pace in eight months when production eased and new orders contracted in February.

China has kept the economic growth target at 7.5 percent for this year, and tried to keep inflation at under 3.5 percent.

The search for the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet that disappeared without a trace more than a week ago was on Monday expanded to include a wider area spanning Australia to Kazakhstan.

Malaysia’s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters here that Australia and Indonesia were leading the search from the west of Sumatra to the south of the Indian Ocean. China and Kazakhstan are searching in the northern corridor from Laos to the Caspian Sea.

Flight MH370 with 239 people on board disappeared on March 8 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lampur. Most of the passengers of the Boeing 777-200 were Chinese nationals.

In addition to hijack, investigators are exploring the possibility of a suicide bid by the pilot or co-pilot, sabotage, kidnapping and terrorism.

A police source said investigators were studying the flight simulator found at the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 52. The experienced pilot is a member of Malaysia’s Opposition party, whose leader, Anwar Ibrahim, was convicted of sodomy a few hours before the jet disappeared.

“So far there’s no evidence politics was involved in this incident,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

Malaysia Airlines said co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid was most likely to have made the final spoken communication with the ATC in Kuala Lumpur before the aircraft disappeared from the radar.

Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, the airline’s chief executive, said the voice from the cockpit said, “All right, good night,” at about 1.19 a.m. on March 8 (1719 GMT, March 7), 12 minutes after the last transmission of data from the jet’s ACARS communications system.###4123||Empty###4124||Empty###4125||Empty###4126||If there’s a lesson to be learned from the bitcoin collapse, it’s that just because an investment is trendy and cool, that doesn’t mean you should abandon all common sense and sink your money into it.

“Digital currencies right now are very, very trendy,” said Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board. “There’s a lot of buzz about them. It’s really easy to look at the benefits, the positives of digital currencies, without really appreciating these risks.

“Those risks can wipe out the entirety of their investment in not months, not weeks, but in a matter of moments.”

Digital currencies like bitcoin are essentially long lines of computer code that may be encrypted and sent or received without involving a financial institution or government agency.

“In many ways, digital currencies operate as ‘online cash,’ only this type of currency is extremely volatile and can disappear the same way your money disappears when you lose your wallet,” said John Morgan, Texas securities commissioner.

Bitcoin has become increasingly popular among tech enthusiasts, libertarians and risk-seeking investors because it allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money across borders without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. Criminals like bitcoin for the same reasons.

The currency attracted media attention and the fascination of millions as an increasing number of large retailers such as Overstock.com began to accept it.

Bitcoin isn’t the only digital currency that’s sprung up.

“The last I checked, which was right at the beginning of this year, there were about 14 digital currencies,” Rotunda said. “There’s more of them in production right now, in development. It’s a real fertile ground.”

Investors must use caution when dealing with digital currencies, securities regulators said.

“Anybody who’s investing in digital currencies is going to be highly dependent upon the securities systems, the infrastructure, the accounting practices, overall business model of whomever they’re entrusting the custody of their investment to,” Rotunda said.

What’s more, a lack of regulation of digital currencies leaves investors exposed, he said.

“Digital currencies in large part allow users to be anonymous,” Rotunda said. “That makes it hard from a regulatory standpoint to regulate those transactions, but it also fosters an environment that caters to money laundering to conceal transactions to all sorts of situations where a promoter could be playing with investors’ money without their own knowledge.”

That includes Ponzi schemes. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.

Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in investments that promoters claim generate high returns with little or no risk.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint last year that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin-denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.

The SEC alleged that from September 2011 to September 2012 Shavers raised more than 700,000 bitcoins worth about $4.5 million based on bitcoin prices then.

“We are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes in which these currencies are used to facilitate fraudulent, or simply fabricated, investments or transactions,” the SEC said in an Investor Alert in July. “These schemes often promise high returns for getting in on the ground floor of a growing Internet phenomenon.”

Rotunda had advice for investors.

“If you’re investing in bitcoins or something tied to bitcoins or other digital currencies, do due diligence on the person promoting the investment,” he said. “Try to look at these things objectively, evaluate their own personal situation. An investment tied to digital currencies may be suitable for someone in their 20s, in their 30s. When you’re talking about a retiree’s nest egg, that may not be something they’d want to subject to this type of a risk.”

This drop comes after the strong uptick in applications at the end of February.The MBA’s seasonally adjusted index of mortgage activity fell 2.1% to 373.3 in the week ending on March 7. At the end of last year, the index reached its lowest level since December 2000 shortly after the Federal Reserve announced it would begin reducing its monthly bond purchasing program as the economy improves.

The seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications dropped 3.1% week-over-week, with refinancing activity making up 57% of all mortgage activity, down from 57.7%. This is 6% lower than the refinancing share at the start of 2014 and the lowest share since April 2011. Requests for home purchase loans fell 0.5%. The unadjusted purchase index was 17% lower than a year earlier.

During the week, contract and effective rates rose for all mortgage products, with the average rate for a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4.52% with 0.29 points, compared to 4.47% with 0.28 points a week before.

The average rate for a jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loan was 4.41%, which represents an increase of 4 basis points from the previous week. FHA loans carried an average rate of 4.18% (up from 4.13%), while 15-year fixed loans increased to an average 3.53% (up from 3.52%).

Adjustable rate mortgages represented 8% of all mortgage applications, which has remained unchanged for more than a month.

The MBA survey covers 75% of retail residential mortgage applications in the country and has been conducted weekly since 1990.

This new data comes just a day after a housing survey found home price gains slowed in December. The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index for 20 major cities rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in December, compared to 0.9% the month before. Prices rose 13.7% in 2013 and reached their peak in November.

Recent housing data released over the past two months shows that activity at the start of 2014 is slowing and the housing recovery is losing momentum.

Housing starts dropped 16% in January, which is the largest drop in more than 3 years, while home resales dropped to an 18-month low in February. Extreme winter weather across the United States has been blamed at least in part for much of this weakness, although analysts believe rising mortgage rates and low inventory is doing its part as well.###4128||Empty###4129||By Natalie Thomas and Adam Rose

BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Furious relatives of passengers on a missing Malaysia aircraft are ramping up pressure on the Malaysian and Chinese governments to give them answers about what has happened, threatening lawsuits and demanding to see Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Surrounded by reporters who have flocked to the nondescript Beijing hotel where they have been told by the airline to gather, relatives are lashing out at the media, the airline and their own government for ignoring their plight.

“I really want to see President Xi - I don’t know right now what could possibly be more important than the lives of these 200 people,” said a young woman who gave her family name as Wen, fighting back tears.

“I also want to ask Mrs Xi, if your husband, President Xi, was on the plane, just imagine, if it was you, how would your parents feel?

“My husband was on the plane, every day my children are asking me about their dad, what am I supposed to do? ... We’re helpless, we need our government to support us.”

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur early on Saturday and dropped off civilian radar screens less than an hour into its flight to Beijing, a mystery that has yet to be solved.

Another person, who declined to give his name, said a lawsuit was the only way forward.

“We are definitely going sue them. This is really bad. (We are not suing) Malaysia Airlines, but the Malaysian government,” he told reporters.

One man from Beijing, speaking to reporters after a meeting between the families and Malaysian diplomats, said it was ridiculous the Malaysians seemed to have no information about even the most basic facts.

“The exact demands were the exact position the plane disappeared at, the time it disappeared, and what happened in the time between the time when the plane was first reported missing and 2.40,” he said, recounting the meeting on Thursday with the diplomats, who left without speaking to reporters.

Malaysia Airlines, the Malaysian and Chinese governments say they are doing all they can for the relatives, though Beijing has demanded Kuala Lumpur drastically step up its efforts.

Hugh Dunleavy, Malaysia Airlines’ commercial director, told Reuters on Wednesday they were having a problem with some people who were turning up at the hotel and claiming free meals and rooms when they had nothing to do with the flight.

“I’m trying to get that organised with the family members, to say, let’s take a real look at this, because they’re complaining that they don’t want them in there,” he said.

The loss of a relative threatens to cause real difficulty for some of the families left behind.

Feng Zhishan, 50, said his son Feng Dong, 22, was flying back to China via Kuala Lumpur from Singapore, where he had been working on building a new subway line.

“Our family has no money,” Feng told Reuters. “They all said, you can make more money in Singapore.”

Another man, who refused to give his name, said his cousin was on the flight, having transited in Kuala Lumpur on his way home from a business trip in Australia.

“He’s a really outgoing guy, loves travelling and sports. He was just 27 this year, and with a six month old son,” he said, visibly distressed.

“It’s been more than 70 hours. By now their officials should have given us some kind of explanation.”

Paul Yin, a U.S.-trained psychologist, said he was at the hotel to offer counselling services.

“They go through ups and downs every day. Some are even suicidal,” he said.

“Chinese society is based on the family unit. Especially with the one-child policy, if your kids are gone... for many people their purpose in life is circled around the next generation, and if they’re gone some people don’t see a purpose in being around any more.”###4130||Empty###4131||Empty###4132||Empty###4133||Zee Media Bureau/ Neha Attre

Get Free Guide ‘Maximize Your Social Security Benefits’

A recent short but revealing speech by new Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shows how her Fed era will differ from earlier tenures.The speech at her swearing in ceremony shows the Fed will focus more on average Americans than economic statistics, Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, wrote in an article for The Huffington Post "I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy. The unemployment rate represents millions of individuals who are eager to work, but struggling to provide for themselves and their families," Yellen stated in her speech , saying creating jobs will help "build a stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation."Hartmann was more than pleased at the speech, as well as the swearing in ceremony"For me, an economist who has dedicated my life to advancing the status of women, experiencing first-hand Janet Yellen's elevation to this leadership position — making her arguably the most powerful woman in the world — was deeply moving," Hartmann said.The Fed's goals are clear: maximum employment and stable prices, Yellen noted in her speech. "It is equally clear that the economy continues to operate considerably short of these objectives."Although the Fed has made progress under the guidance of former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, much work remains to be done, she said. Yellen also pledged to finish implementing Dodd-Frank regulations and continue striving to explain the Fed's actions."I'll do more of that explaining . . . when I respond to questions from the media after the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee."That press conference, scheduled for Wednesday, will be key, according to The Wall Street Journal . Financial markets will be looking for clues on how fast the Fed will taper its bond-buying program. Most importantly, markets will be watching how Yellen moves the Fed "from threshold-predicted forward guidance to more qualitative forward guidance," JP Morgan Chase Chief U.S. Economist Michael Feroli told The Journal.Previously, the Fed had said it would consider raising interest rates when the unemployment rate, now at 6.7 percent, fell to 6.5 percent. The central bank must replace that hard figure with more qualitative guidance."We believe that this switch will be done with an intent to convey no change in the stance of policy, much like Indiana Jones replacing the golden idol with a bag of sand," Feroli said.###4136||Colorado raked in about $2 million from taxes on recreational marijuana in January, the first month it was legal to sell non-medicinal pot in the state.

State officials say the numbers came in as expected.

On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational marijuana to anyone age 21 or older. Cannabis purchases are limited to one ounce. It's the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale.

Related: How a marijuana ad went up in smoke

Colorado places a 15% excise tax, a 10% special sales tax and a 2.9% sales tax on recreational marijuana, in addition to application and license fees. It imposes just a 2.9% sales tax, as well as application on license fees, on medical marijuana, which was legalized by voters in Colorado in 2000.

When combined with taxes and fees from medicinal marijuana, the state brought in a total of $3.5 million in January from pot sales.

The state also taxes alcohol, which brought in about $5.1 million in taxes in December, the most recent data available from the Colorado Department of Revenue.

A big chunk of the funds collected from marijuana taxes will be funneled to programs aimed at keeping kids way from pot. The governor has requested funds for the prevention of youth marijuana, for treatment of substance use, regulatory oversight, and law enforcement and public safety.###4137||###4138||Empty###4139||Empty###4140||The Bitcoin community has been angrily pressing for details on what the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users' bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox's staff isn't talking. So another group of hackers say they've broken into the company's servers to provide answers of their own.

On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. "It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be "goxed"--to suffer from Mt. Gox's technical glitches.

The hackers also posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles' personal website that they said comprised stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers. It appears to include an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a file that purports to show the company's balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox's parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers' access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles' home addresses and Karpeles' personal CV.

Update: Users on Reddit are warning that the hackers’ files may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins. Other Reddit users have confirmed that they found their own account history in the data, indicating that it’s not fake. But for security reasons, I don’t recommend anyone download the collection of hacked files.

In the hackers' summary of Mt. Gox's balances in various currencies, they point to a claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they take as evidence that Mark Karpeles' claim to have lost users' digital currency to hackers is fraudulent. "That fat fuck has been lying!!" a note in the file reads.

I've reached out to Karpeles for comment, but haven't yet heard back from him. Mt. Gox's embattled chief executive has remained almost entirely mum as his company has imploded over the last weeks.

In a possibly related incident, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum posted a message--since deleted by the forum's moderators--claiming to be offering for sale a 20 gigabyte stolen database from Mt. Gox, including the personal details of all its users and even scans of their passports. "This document will never be elsewhere published by us," wrote the user, who went by the name nanashi____. "Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure." The hacker asked for a price of 100 bitcoins for the database, about $63,600 at current exchange rates. '

I've reached out to nanashi____ via an email address he or she provided, and I'll update this post if I hear back.

I couldn't verify that Sunday's database dump was real, or that it showed any of the "lying" that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox's accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins--that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.

But as Bitcoin experts pore over the hacked files, they may yet offer clues to the mystery around Mt. Gox's fate. The Bitcoin community has been puzzled by the apparent lack of movement of Mt. Gox's bitcoins since the company declared bankruptcy last month. Despite stating that it lost 850,000 bitcoins in total in its bankruptcy filing, Bitcoin experts haven't seen the movement of those coins in the Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy.

Moderators on the Bitcoin subforum on Reddit deleted the hackers' post a few hours after it first appeared, stating that posting stolen content violated the forum's etiquette rules. But users on the forum didn't hesitate to draw their own conclusions: the top post on the forum Sunday afternoon read "Mt. Gox scam was just exposed -- MK [Mark Karpeles] officially stole our funds."

"We've been goxed!" it added.

On Sunday, Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US having filed a similar application in Japan on 28 February. The particular chapter of bankruptcy protection sought deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.

The move is just the latest move in the unfolding story of what was once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, handling up to 80% of all trades at one point in 2013.

On 28 February the exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo claiming that 850,000 bitcoins (at the time worth around £240 million) had been stolen from the exchange, 100,000 which belonged to the company and 750,000 belonging to the customers.

Chapter 15 protection in the US was introduced back in 1997 and is almost entirely based on the UN Model Law which aims to modernise and harmonise cross-border insolvencies around the world.

Some relief

If granted it would provide some relief for Mt. Gox, including the granting of an "automatic stay" preventing creditors seizing its US assets.

A company files for bankruptcy protection if it believes it can recover financially, given time and some amount of restructuring and reorganisation - this could include a change of management, business model or the selling of a highly-value assets such as buildings (which could be leased back from the buyer) or vehicles.

When a company files for bankruptcy outright, it has accepted that it is no longer able to repay its creditors and any steps for recovery are impossible.

The latest move in Mt. Gox's story comes after hackers claim to have stolen transaction logs from the exchange which they published on Karpeles' personal blog over the weekend. The hackers claim the under-fire CEO was lying about the amount of bitcoins the exchange had leading to many users of Mt. Gox to claim Karpeles had stolen their bitcoins.###4146||Why did this happen?

A new crowdsourcing website called Tomnod set up to allow people to search satellite images for Malaysia Flight 370 has crashed.

The website became unresponsive as the viral topic surged in social discussions within the hour of the initiative being reported.

ABC highlights the crowdsourcing search for the flight and explains how Tomnod was set up by DigitalGlobe, based in Colorado to give people the tools to look through satellite imagery of the Pacific ocean.

Due to the time zones, there are currently no updates being issued from the team behind the Tomnod satellite search, but we expect some more updates later in the day.

The overwhelming demand from international visitors has made the website either not responsive or unable to load new connections. As of this moment, a “Could not open connection to database error” appears for users wishing to log in.

As the mystery over the jet’s disappearance deepens, the crowdsourcing website could aid Asian nations currently exploring the ocean to pinpoint unusual objects floating in the water.

The satellite imagery available on the Tomnod website is of very high resolution giving uses the ability to comb the sea surface at distance of just a few meters.

According to GM’s filing on Wednesday with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, GM received a report on the "passlock" system for the Saturn Ion's ignition switch in 2001, during pre-production development of the car. The chronology was released to explain a second batch vehicles recalled globally last month.

The report said the ignition switch’s problem was "low detent plunger force," but a change in the design of the ignition switch resolved the problems. GM engineers and outside investigators would later find a similar problem with a Delphi-supplied ignition switch used in 1.6 million vehicles between model years 2003 and 2007.

The problem was fixed when Delphi began using a different detent plunger and spring to increase the torque in the switch.

In a 2003 report, a service technician observed that a car had stalled while driving, and noted that "[t]he owner had several keys on the key ring," and suggested that "[t]he additional weight of the keys had worn out the ignition switch."

In its previous filings with NHTSA, the first warning sign that GM disclosed came in 2004, around the time the Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale.

The fact that ignition switch problems with the Saturn Ion predate problems with the Chevrolet Cobalt also raises questions about why GM did not recall the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion and Saturn Sky at the same time as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

GM recalled U.S. cars in two batches: the Cobalt and G5 on Feb. 13, and the rest on Feb. 25.

GM now is telling drivers to remove all items from their key ring besides the ignition key until the repairs are completed, and that even afterward they should not put anything but the car's key fob back onto the ring.###4153||You are using an older browser version.

In a statement, Toyota said it was left "with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel".

Located outside Bangalore, the two factories produce around 700 cars a day. The lockout will affect 6,400 workers.

Toyota said that over the past 25 days, "certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business".

Negotiations over a wage increase have been taking place for the past 10 months.

Toyota's sales in India represented about 1.6% of the carmaker's total sales volume last year.

The stoppage in India came just a week after Toyota announced its biggest pay rise in 21 years for its Japanese staff.

The average Toyota employee will earn 2,700 yen ($26) more each month, a 0.8% increase from the year before.

Some workers will also receive about 7,300 yen more each month depending on promotions.

The increases were announced in conjunction with other large Japanese firms such as Panasonic and Nissan as part of a co-ordinated effort by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to boost wages ahead of a planned tax increase, which is set to come into effect in April.###4156||SINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - Gold edged lower for a second straight session on Monday after strong U.S. jobs data eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal.

Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average took a slight dip on Wednesday, stocks generally advanced, despite global anxiety over the antics of Vladimir Putin.

The economic slowdown in China continued to weigh heavily on the minds of investors, as the S&P 500 spent most of the day in the red, before breaking into positive territory during the last ten minutes of the session.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 11 points to finish Wednesday’s trading session at 16,340 for a 0.07 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) rose 0.03 percent to 1,868.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) climbed 0.42 percent to finish at 3,707. The Russell 2000 (IWM) advanced 0.36 percent to 1,191.

In other major markets, oil (USO) sank 1.28 percent to close at $35.35.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined 41 cents (0.38 percent) to $107.47/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures advanced $20.40 (1.52 percent) to $1,367.10 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector was back in the express lane during Wednesday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average advanced 0.34 percent to 7,585 (IYT).

In Japan, the exchange rate for the yen remained the dominant factor in stock market activity. Japanese stocks dropped as the yen strengthened to 102.92 per dollar during the last 20 minutes of Wednesday’s trading session in Tokyo. A stronger yen causes Japanese exports to be less competitively priced in foreign markets (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 2.59 percent to 14,830 (EWJ).

Although investors worldwide remained worried about China’s economic slowdown and its impact on copper prices, it was just another day in mainland China. Nothing to see here … Move along now. The Shanghai Composite Index declined by a mere 0.17 percent to 1,997 (FXI). Nevertheless, the gamblers in Hong Kong were more mindful of the risks ahead. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.65 percent to 21,901 (EWH).

Ongoing tension over Russia’s plans for Crimea was not the only thing which kept European investors in a risk-averse mood on Wednesday. Eurostat reported that industrial production in the Eurozone declined by 0.2 percent in January, despite economists’ expectations of a 0.5 percent advance. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Wednesday’s session with a 0.88 percent drop to 3,065 – crossing below its 50-day moving average of 3,091. Its Relative Strength Index is 43.73 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 rose further above its 50-day moving average of 1,828 on Wednesday, after advancing 0.03 percent to 1,868. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose from 60.68 to 60.88. The MACD is dropping toward the signal line, suggesting that the S&P could resume its decline during the immediate future.

On Wednesday, four sectors advanced and five sectors declined. The industrial sector took the hardest hit, falling 0.19 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.15%

Technology: (XLK): +0.17%

Industrials (XLI): -0.19%

Materials: (XLB): -0.04%

Energy (XLE): +0.01%

Financials: (XLF): -0.18%

Utilities (XLU): +1.26%

Health Care: (XLV): -0.02%

Consumer Staples (XLP): +0.21%

Bottom line: Although investors remained anxious about China’s economic slowdown and the situation in the Ukraine, stocks generally advanced on Wednesday, although the Dow lacked the energy to make it through a late-day attempt to break out of the red.

CHICAGO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Friday, after a closely-watched February jobs report signaled stronger-than- expected employment trends, dulling the metal's investment appeal.

The most active gold contract for April delivery fell 13.6 U.S. dollars, or 1.01 percent, to settle at 1,338.2 dollars per ounce. The Labor Department said that U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs to their payrolls in February, topping the market consensus of 150, 000 positions.

Safe-haven assets like gold fell sharply in the wake of the upbeat jobs data. Analysts said the market has been looking to the U.S. economic data for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually taper its monthly bond-buying program.

Some analysts say, gold is experiencing a lack of safe-haven demand on Friday, with the situation in Ukraine stabilized, while others believe, the endgame is not currently clear. If the Ukraine situation further degrades, gold can still rise due to the safe- haven demand in the coming weeks.

Silver for May delivery lost 64.6 cents, or 3.0 percent, to close at 20.928 dollars per ounce.###4161||No one can easily dismiss the significance of the spectacular bankruptcy of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange and a company that helped build the virtual currency. Yet Mt. Gox’s half-billion-dollar loss had a remarkably small effect on the global Bitcoin economy. The collapse, for instance, did not seem to shake the Bitcoin faithful. “I think Bitcoin is interesting because it forces people to rethink what money is and how value moves around the world,” declares Barry Silbert, CEO of New York–based SecondMarket, which is planning to launch a Bitcoin exchange. “In its current iteration as digital currency and as a global transaction network, it has the potential to radically transform our financial system.”

In many ways, the evolution of Bitcoin continues. For example, Internet retailer Overstock.com reported that after accepting Bitcoin as payment in early January, it had clocked $1 million in sales via the currency by early March; Overstock projected that annual sales could rise to $15 million or more. The number of registered digital wallets at Blockchain.info rose from 1,297,394 on February 25, when Mt. Gox shut down, to 1,370,473 two weeks later, growing at the same rate as before the bankruptcy. Blockchain, based in Skelton, England, publishes online Bitcoin transactions on a real-time basis. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is moving into automated teller machines. Robocoin, a Las Vegas company that operates a network tied to some of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, has placed 14 Bitcoin ATMs around the world, 12 in March alone.

But the real action in Bitcoin may be taking place in New York. Entrepreneurs ranging from venture capitalists like Marc Andreessen to CEOs like Silbert and high-profile investors like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are beginning to envision a new generation of Bitcoin businesses that engage the U.S. regulatory system. They share a perspective that involves linking the Bitcoin community with Wall Street and investors — plugging Bitcoin into the financial system. And they describe a new era of regulation, particularly for Bitcoin as a global payment system, moving away from Bitcoin as a store of value and ultimate currency. Like so much about Bitcoin, their ideas are future-oriented and dizzyingly optimistic, though they also bring a realism to this emerging virtual currency that it hasn’t always had. But is Bitcoin still Bitcoin once it’s left the Wild West?

The promise of Bitcoin seemed tenuous on February 28, at a packed press conference at Tokyo District Court, where Mt. Gox’s 28-year-old, French-born CEO, Mark Karpelès, revealed that 748,408 customer coins and an additional 100,000 owned by the exchange had disappeared as a result of fraudulent activity by unknown parties, made possible by a “weakness in the system.” The alleged theft represented 7 percent of the 12.4 million coins then in circulation and a loss of $479 million at $565 per Bitcoin, the value on that date. Mt. Gox suffered from a $27 million shortfall, bringing the total loss to $506 million.

The Mt. Gox disaster triggered a firestorm of reaction and comment. Bitcoin was already controversial. But Mt. Gox stirred up demands from regulators, politicians and policymakers that the Bitcoin community needed to go to far greater lengths to demonstrate it could protect digital financial assets; provide secure, reliable and legal transactions; expand capital reserves; create strong financial institutions; and be capable of withstanding attacks.

Today, as Bitcoin moves beyond Mt. Gox, the tempest has receded. “The failure of Mt. Gox is certainly a significant event relative to Bitcoin,” says Edmund Moy, a former director of the U.S. Mint who was tasked by the Treasury Department with monitoring the development of the currency from 2009 to 2011. (Moy is currently chief strategist with Morgan Gold, which provides a vehicle for 401[k] and IRA participants to invest in physical gold.) “But it’s not fatal, because the problem was with Mt. Gox and not Bitcoin.”

What went wrong? Moy says, “A quirk in Bitcoin’s programming allowed for what is known as transactional malleability.” This is a technical way of saying a very clever theft. The flaw first appeared in June 2011, when Mt. Gox was hacked and 25,000 or more coins were transferred from individual accounts. Given Bitcoin’s $15 price at the time, this represented at least $375,000. The flaw allowed the criminal to alter a transaction’s term before it was completed, first creating a delay, then allowing the hacker to change the name of the recipient, according to Moy.

Mt. Gox detected the fraudulent duplicate transactions and reimbursed customers whose coins had been stolen. In response to the security flaw at Mt. Gox, other Bitcoin-related companies attacked the problem and worked around it to secure sites. Mt. Gox also tried to address the flaw, but “it’s hard work to change your own software,” says Moy, and the exchange apparently did not do enough to improve security on individual accounts.

In February hackers probably devised a way around the various security patches, Moy says. Once the vulnerability was discovered, hackers “stormed and overwhelmed the Mt. Gox system.”

But in January, even before the attack, Mt. Gox had slowed the rate at which it allowed withdrawals, says Benjamin Isgur, a Bitcoin trader based in the Washington area who blogs on digital currencies at TheBlogChain. Isgur reported the slowdown on January 24. “Until they [Mt. Gox] suddenly become transparent and provide any reasonable explanation and solution for their current withdrawal issues, Mt. Gox is Mt. Vesuvius,” he wrote a month before the exchange failed. According to an unnamed source in a report in Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, a massive distribution denial-of-service assault on the trading platform hit on February 7, just as the thefts began, and continued until February 10, crippling systems. Most of the attacks came from the U.S. and Europe, the report said. Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals on February 10.

“There are two ways to look at this — strategically and tactically,” says Steven Lord, editor of Modern Money Letter, which reports on alternative currencies. Strategically, the benefits of Bitcoin remain. “Tactically, this has raised the specter of Bitcoin being some huge Wild West that’s completely unregulated,” he says. The failure, he explains, raises important questions that bear on regulation — anathema to some in the Bitcoin community. “Whose job is it to make sure no one is stealing currency?” asks Lord. “The effort to answer that question is now going to become extremely accelerated.” Two weeks after Mt. Gox failed, Japan indicated that it plans to regulate Bitcoin as a commodity and tax Bitcoin purchases and profits.

Bitcoin companies may need to take matters into their own hands and create a self-regulatory regime, says Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “The best way to ensure Bitcoin’s future is to come up with some voluntary regulations, at a bare minimum,” he says. “Based on whether or not those are sufficient, it will become clear the extent to which regulators will become involved.” Bitcoin companies have collaborated to enhance security and have launched an industry organization called the Bitcoin Foundation.

Self-regulation may clash with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, which is rooted in a libertarian and free-market ethos. Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek supported the idea that state-owned currencies should compete with private currencies. Remarkably, the federal government has taken a hands-off approach, at least so far. In a November 18, 2013, letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, then–Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke wrote that although digital currencies could be used for money laundering and raised oversight issues, “there are also areas where [digital currencies] may hold long-term promise.” That sentence is credited with sending Bitcoin prices soaring from $575 to $775.

Bernanke also noted that the Fed lacks the authority to regulate a virtual currency unless “it is issued by, or cleared or settled through, a banking organization we supervise.” Bernanke’s stance was recently reiterated by his successor, new Fed chair Janet Yellen. In congressional testimony shortly after Mt. Gox, Yellen indicated that the Fed intends to steer clear of Bitcoin and that she thought Treasury should be the regulator.

“I understand people involved in Bitcoin don’t want the government breathing down their neck,” says Chilton. “At the same time, governments will get involved if they see potential problems.”

Just over a year ago, Bitcoin got something of a green light in the U.S. when the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part of Treasury, issued guidance that administrators and exchanges of virtual currencies would have to register with the agency as money services businesses and adhere to related reporting and recordkeeping regulations, just like foreign exchange dealers. Far from threatening Bitcoin, that decision was a catalyst. “I would call that ruling a watershed moment,” says Gil Luria, chief analyst for financial technology at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “Before that ruling there was a notion that Bitcoin was so ambitious and so revolutionary that the government would necessarily want to squash it.”

Luria says Treasury may have been motivated by the realization that trying to kill Bitcoin would only drive it overseas, where it would thrive using online access to foreign outlets. “What is much preferable to the government is to have third-party entities like Coinbase, BitPay and others emerge that they can regulate,” Luria explains.

So far, three U.S.-based exchange companies have registered with FinCEN as money services businesses, says Braden Perry, a partner in the Prairie Village, Kansas, law firm of Kennyhertz Perry and a former CFTC litigator: San Francisco’s Kraken; Palo Alto, California’s Buttercoin; and New York’s Coinsetter. Perry calls the FinCEN decision “a huge boost for the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially in the U.S., where exchanges were not able to form banking relationships.”

Now they can, if they can persuade banks to accept the risks of providing services to Bitcoin traders. However, Perry points out, there is also a downside: state regulation. New York State Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky held hearings on Bitcoin in late January. On March 12 he called for proposals to recommend how the state should regulate virtual-currency exchanges. He said New York wants exchanges to be well capitalized, provide strong cybersecurity protections and conduct background checks on managers.

Not surprisingly, some in Congress have also grown concerned about Bitcoin, though no legislation has resulted. The lead player: Delaware Democratic Senator Tom Carper, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. In November, Carper held hearings on money laundering, drug trafficking and other criminal activity revealed by an FBI raid on underground online market Silk Road last October. With the failure of Mt. Gox, Carper’s interests shifted to consumer protection. “Regulatory agencies must remain vigilant in their monitoring of this emerging payment system,” says the senator.

The frequent comparison of Bitcoin to the Wild West — a comparison highlighted by the Mt. Gox debacle — points to a central concern. Bitcoin exchanges, which ought to be pillars of strength and trust, are instead the most vulnerable part of the Bitcoin economy. It’s not just a regulatory problem. “What we’ve got in the Bitcoin space right now are exchanges that mostly function more like retail brokerages, you might say, from the institutional perspective,” says Peter Vessenes, CEO of Seattle-based Bitcoin incubator CoinLab and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation. “There aren’t any real institutional-style liquidity providers out there right now,” he adds. “Most of the liquidity on exchanges is in the dollar market, while other currencies lag far behind, including the euro. I think we’ll probably see stronger euro liquidity this year. But liquidity is so thin right now that people would rather trade dollar for coin.”

Wall Street analysts are unimpressed with the oldest Bitcoin exchanges, many of them in developing nations with little regulation. The remedy: more-robust exchanges. “We’re in a stage of passing the torch in terms of exchanges,” says Wedbush’s Luria. “The exchanges we had in the past were ill equipped to deal with volumes and stresses of a more developed market. Gox is a perfect illustration: It was entirely ill equipped to handle stresses of modern trading and the kind of nefarious people who try to hack financial institutions.”

Luria predicts that over the next few months more-mature exchanges will emerge, funded by venture capital and operating in the developed world under sophisticated regulatory regimes.

Meanwhile, existing exchanges have moved to fill the vacuum. The volume leader is Bitstamp, which last year was moved from Slovenia to Reading, England, by its CEO, Nejc Kodric. The second largest is BTC-e, which is based in Bulgaria, although its terms of use adhere to Cypriot law. The founders of BTC-e use only their Russian names, Aleksey and Alexander. Russia, whose law forbids surrogate currencies, is investigating the exchange. Then there’s BTC China, based in Shanghai. Once the largest exchange, BTC China saw its volume fall after the country clamped down on Bitcoin, but in recent months it has rebounded. BTC China’s Stanford University–educated CEO is Bobby Lee, whose brother Charlie Lee invented Litecoin, a digital rival to Bitcoin. In early December, China’s central bank and a number of governmental bodies declared Bitcoin to be a “virtual commodity” and not a currency and prohibited banks and payment systems from providing Bitcoin-related services. China and Brazil are the only nations with specific Bitcoin regulations, according to a Law Library of Congress report issued in January.

For Bitcoin to move into its next phase of development, it will need the acceptance of institutional investors and Wall Street, which can provide investment flows and more-sophisticated market discipline. The CEOs of two New York–based Bitcoin companies — Jaron Lukasiewicz at Coinsetter and Second­Market’s Silbert — believe they can make that happen. “This will be the year when the seeds are placed so institutional Wall Street can really connect to Bitcoin,” Lukasiewicz says. For now, however, regulatory challenges have not been resolved. “The majority of people in the Bitcoin space are retail and not trading on a U.S. exchange. That’s a problem we are solving.”

Lukasiewicz views major overseas exchanges as “poorly built.” Coinsetter has constructed an electronic communication network that matches buy and sell orders. It routes trades to Bitstamp for liquidity and expects to add overseas exchanges. Coinsetter is also building its own financial information exchange (FIX) application programming interface (API), a standard used by banks, prime brokerages and hedge funds. “That FIX API will potentially turn us technologically into a plug-and-play option for Wall Street platforms,” Lukasiewicz says. The regulatory challenge is that registered broker-dealers and licensed traders in the U.S. cannot work with unlicensed brokerages; it’s crucial for Bitcoin exchanges to obtain the necessary licensing.

Even though Coinsetter has registered as a money services business, the company needs to be licensed by a federal regulator to avoid licensing requirements by various states. “Right now there is no meaningful way to obtain a license, so that’s why you haven’t seen any U.S. Bitcoin exchanges emerge yet,” Lukasiewicz says.

Coinsetter is talking with brokerages about providing liquidity and exploring possible partnerships. But no one knows which agency would approve a license: the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CFTC or one of the federal banking overseers. Still, Lukasiewicz optimistically adds, “There’s a good chance we'll be the only licensed exchange in the United States in the next few months.”

CoinLab’s Vessenes believes Bitcoin needs more than just well-funded, secure and licensed exchanges. Bitcoin also has to boost so-called market capitalization to attract venture funding and institutional investors. With 12.5 million coins in circulation, the digital currency had a market cap on March 11, at $624 per coin, of $7.8 billion. So far, Bitcoin “mining” — solving complex algorithmic problems with specialized computers in exchange for new Bitcoins — has attracted the most venture funding because it’s the most lucrative. Wedbush estimates $86 million in venture capital had been invested in Bitcoin by mid-February, plus some $200 million in mining equipment.

Despite Mt. Gox, the ardor of early venture enthusiasts remains undimmed. For example, Andreessen, a partner in Silicon Valley venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has invested in Bitcoins — and lost coins at Mt. Gox. “This is like MF Global, not some huge breakdown of the underlying technology or other exchanges,” he told CNBC in early March. “Bitcoin protocol is unchanged, and other exchanges and companies are doing fine.”

And there’s Fred Wilson, a partner at New York–based Union Square Ventures, who has invested in Coinbase and wrote on his blog on February 25 that he “bought a little Bitcoin today” after Mt. Gox shut down. “I always feel good buying when there is blood in the streets in any market.”

Another Bitcoin venture investor is Jim Breyer, a partner at Accel Partners, which has invested in Boston-based payment platform Circle Internet Financial. Google Ventures has put cash into companies such as OpenCoin, the company behind distributed currency exchange Ripple, and more recently Buttercoin, a trading platform hoping to become an exchange.

Centralway, based in Zurich, has also invested in Buttercoin. “We are convinced that in the future alternative currencies will play as important a role as traditional currencies,” says Severin Jan Rüegger, managing partner for Centralway’s regulated investment fund. “Buttercoin will take Bitcoin exchanges to the next level through strong partnerships with key local partners, ensuring full compliance and strict adherence to all local regulation. After all, why shouldn’t buying Bitcoin be as easy and secure as buying dollars or stocks?”

In September, SecondMarket launched Bitcoin Investment Trust, which has $50 million in assets. The fund is open to institutions and high-net-worth individuals. SecondMarket is spinning off its digital-­currency business into an unnamed company that will also operate an exchange, which SecondMarket says will be capitalized with $20 million in cash and Bitcoin assets.

Unlike existing exchanges, the proposed SecondMarket operation will operate a hub-and-spoke arrangement like those of the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, CEO Silbert says. The exchange is the hub, and broker-dealer members are the spokes. “Direct access to the exchange is not provided except through one of the members,” he says. The exchange will have central clearing. Silbert also plans a self-regulatory organization to provide governance and monitor exchange activities. And Silbert has been chasing the necessary regulatory approvals.

Silbert expects the New York State Department of Financial Services to soon identify who needs a BitLicense, as well as a process for obtaining one. “I think they recognize there’s a pretty good opportunity for New York to emerge as a Bitcoin-friendly, if not a leading, state for Bitcoin entrepreneurs to set up businesses,” he says.

One of the most ambitious efforts to mainstream Bitcoin comes from the now-famous Winklevoss twins. The pair gained notoriety for suing Facebook over claims that social media network founder Mark Zuckerberg stole the concept for the service from them. The pair received a settlement and invested in Bitcoin when it was still in single digits — probably a little more than $1 million. At recent prices their roughly 1 percent of coins outstanding is worth more than $70 million.

In an interview with Institutional Investor, Tyler Winklevoss argues for Bitcoin’s future role as a commodity — that is, as a form of payment. “I don’t think it’s a currency,” he says. “It’s a commodity, much like commodity money. It’s an asset that can transact around the world instantly and for free.” That notion informs the twins’ plan to launch a company selling Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. In July they filed a registration statement for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. An amendment in February added information on daily pricing of the proposed ETF index, dubbed Winkdex, on a net asset value basis.

A Bitcoin ETF is another effort to plug the Bitcoin community into the engines of Wall Street. Kathleen Moriarty, a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman who represents the twins, notes that there hasn’t been “much, if any, interface” among the Bitcoin community, Wall Street and investors. “Cameron and Tyler feel very strongly there should be reasonable regulation,” she says. “That was part of why they filed the registration statement, because no regulator except for FinCEN was talking about Bitcoin. The CFTC wasn’t. The SEC wasn’t. Nobody was at the time.”

Tyler Winklevoss explains: “Our thinking behind the ETF was basically to answer the question that we get asked all the time by friends and families: ‘How do I buy Bitcoin?’ And the answer really isn’t that easy to give. A lot of people want to buy Bitcoin, but they don’t have the time or the technical savvy to buy it and securely store it. And so, in an effort to reduce those pain points and friction, we looked for a solution, and the one we came up with is an ETF mechanism, which gives you the same exposure to the Bitcoin asset class without having to procure it and secure it yourself.”

Moriarty says the twins considered a private fund resembling the one SecondMarket launched last fall but ruled it out because, she says, “you don’t need to really engage the regulators if you just do a private fund.” Instead, they’re proposing a public fund not limited to high-net-worth individuals.

How big is the Bitcoin market? The Winklevoss twins peg it at $400 billion. Second­Market’s Silbert sees it at 5 percent of investments in gold — about $350 billion. Wedbush’s Luria says Bitcoin will take a bite of the $1.9 trillion financial gold market and both global foreign currency reserves (a $7.5 trillion market) and safe-haven currencies ($4.3 trillion). To the extent that Bitcoin captures a slice of the combined $13.7 trillion from these three markets, it could drive up the price ten to 100 times, Luria says.

The downside? What Luria calls “a meaningful probability” that competing digital currencies could undermine Bitcoin. That’s only likely if a better crypto-currency emerges, which he doesn’t see yet.

Others are more skeptical. Steven En­glander, head of Group of Ten currency strategy at Citigroup forex unit CitiFX, questions the basic premise that Bitcoin has unique value, because the total number of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million. “I have ignored Bitcoin as a store of value,” he wrote in a January 3 note. If investors and miners are able to arbitrage among Bitcoin and more than 50 clones, “the outcome will be that there are many perfect or near-perfect substitutes for Bitcoin and the effective supply will be much larger.” That would make Bitcoin valuations “fragile.”

Englander does not entirely rule out a currency role for Bitcoin. “Investors and central banks are looking for improved stores of value beyond fiat currencies, and Bitcoin possibly may be one of them,” he wrote. If Bitcoin operated within the financial system and authorities embraced it, he thinks it would have a better chance of winning the virtual-currency sweepstakes.

Englander believes Bitcoin has a long lead on potential rivals. Like other close observers, including the Winklevoss twins, he sees Bitcoin’s fundamental benefit as its ability to provide secure payments. “If Bitcoin has flaws in its commercial application that the Bitcoin community does not repair for philosophical reasons, competition will emerge,” he warns. In any event, the Bitcoin story is just beginning. • •###4162||Empty###4163||Empty###4164||

Social Security Q&A

What are Ages for Social Security Early Retirement and Full Retirement?

Social Security Q&A this week answers this and has more information for disabled veterans on faster processing of their application for help

March 15, 2014 – The age for applying to receive Social Security benefits used to be simple, because it stayed the same. Now, the age for receiving full benefits keeps moving higher. But, what about early retirement, a reader asks? The Social Security Q&A has the answer. It also provides more details for disabled veterans on the recent move to “high priority” for disability assistance requests.

Question:

My full retirement age is 66 years and 4 months because I was born in 1956. What is the earliest age I can begin receiving retirement benefits? Is it 62 or 62 and 4 months?

Answer:

The earliest age you can begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits is 62. Although the full retirement age is increasing from age 66 to 67 for people born after 1954, you can still apply as early as age 62 regardless of what your full retirement age may be.

If you decide to receive benefits before your full retirement age, you will receive a reduced benefit. Keep in mind you will not be able to receive Medicare coverage until age 65, even if you decide to retire at an earlier age. You can learn more about the full retirement age on our this page at our website.

Question:

I am a disabled veteran. I have a compensation rating of 100% Permanent and Total from the Veteran’s Administration. Will I automatically qualify to receive Social Security disability?

Answer:

No. You would have to apply for Social Security disability and go through the application process.

You may have heard where Social Security recently announced rules regarding an expedited process for processing disability applications filed by veterans with a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation rating of 100% Permanent & Total (P&T).

Carolyn W. Colvin, Acting Commissioner of Social Security recently unveiled a new initiative to expedite disability claims. Under the new process, Social Security will treat these veterans’ applications as high priority and issue expedited decisions, similar to the way the agency currently handles disability claims from Wounded Warriors.

“Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country and it is only right that we ensure they have timely access to the disability benefits they may be eligible for and deserve,” said Acting Commissioner Colvin.

“Social Security worked with Veterans Affairs to identify those veterans with disabilities who have a high probability of also meeting our definition of disability. I am proud of our collaboration and happy to announce this new service for America’s vets.”

In order to receive the expedited service, veterans must tell Social Security they have a VA disability compensation rating of 100% P&T and show proof of their disability rating with their VA Notification Letter. The VA rating only expedites Social Security disability claims processing and does not guarantee an approval for Social Security disability benefits. These veterans must still meet the strict eligibility requirements for a disability allowance.

Social Security plans to launch the expedited process in mid-March. For information about this service, please visit socialsecurity.gov/pgm/disability-pt.htm.

The bankruptcy filing will cut Denver-based Quiznos' debt by more than $400 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.

"The actions we are taking are intended to enable Quiznos to reduce our debt, execute a comprehensive plan to further enhance the customer experience, elevate the profile of the brand and help increase sales and profits for our franchise owners," Stuart K. Mathis, Quiznos's chief executive, said Friday in a release.

Quizno's senior leadership already secured a "pre-packaged" restructuring plan with its creditors and on Friday asked the court in Wilmington, Del., to approve the plan at an April 24 hearing.

On Monday, New York-based pizza chain Sbarro filed for bankruptcy in New York City, the Los Angeles Times reported.

For now, the public has zeroed in on when the U.S. central bank might finally raise rates after more than five years near zero. But that tells only half the story: just as important for American families and businesses is how quickly the Fed will hike borrowing costs, and how high.

The Fed has telegraphed that the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year, as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, and policymakers are increasingly describing how the first tightening cycle in more than a decade will play out. It is an issue that Yellen, who took over as chair of the central bank last month, will almost certainly have to address after a policy meeting next week.

The plan for now is for a series of modest rate increases that do not risk sending the economy into relapse, according to Fed policymakers who have discussed it in recent weeks.

While an unexpected jump in inflation or a dangerous asset bubble could force its hand, the central bank is likely to deliver a dovish message of patience when it comes to removing its extraordinary monetary stimulus.

"What I'm anticipating is that the gradual rise in rates would acknowledge that there are still conditions out there that are sub-optimal," Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, said in an interview last week.

"I can in no way predict exactly the conditions at that time," he added. But "I don't expect when we get to that point that we're likely to have to move the policy rate up in large chunks to get it high fast."

As with its easing cycle, the Fed will be in uncharted territory when the time comes to tighten. No major central bank has had to raise rates after keeping them at effectively zero for as long as the Fed has in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

By stressing a go-slow approach to tightening, the Fed can squeeze a little more stimulus out of its low-rate policy. If financial markets moved to price in a more abrupt tightening cycle, yields on long-term debt would rise, lifting borrowing costs.

"To me you really want to stretch out your expectations about the whole forward path of short rates," New York Fed President William Dudley said last week.

"The more information that the Fed can give about what we are thinking about things going forward, I think the better market participants can assess us and, therefore, financial conditions can be set at an appropriate level."

HOW FAST, HOW HIGH

The Fed could use its March 18-19 policy-setting meeting to map out its plan for rate rises, whether in the formal statement it issues afterward or in Yellen's news conference.

It would not be the first time that a Fed chair will have suggested that rate increases will be far from sharp once they start. Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who stepped down at the end of January, said as much last June.

For Yellen, however, the gradualist approach would mark a departure of sorts.

As Fed vice chair she embraced a strategy known as "optimal control" in which rates are kept low for longer than might otherwise be expected in order to boost hiring. This approach would allow inflation to rise above the Fed's 2 percent target for a short time, a problem that would then be addressed by sharper rate rises.

But most of Yellen's colleagues don't sanction such an approach.

Fed policymakers see the key federal funds rate at just 0.75 percent at the end of 2015, and at 1.75 percent by the end of 2016, according to the median of their forecasts published in December. That's even slower than the two-percentage-points-per-year pace at which Alan Greenspan conducted the Fed's last tightening cycle, which has been seen as the model of patience.

Still, what policymakers say today might not be what they do tomorrow.

"They will say 'gradual and measured pace,' but if the data gets a lot better then they will not hesitate to raise rates much faster," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.

Part of the calculus is deciding how high rates should be once the economy returns to normal. And because economic growth is still hobbled in the wake of the recession, the Fed believes rates may not need to be as high as in the past.

"The issue of how steep the increases are and then also where do we think the new normal interest rates are; I think those are really important questions," John Williams, the head of the San Francisco Fed, said last week.###4170||Empty###4171||Why did this happen?

Starwood, whose Sheraton Great Wall opened in Beijing in 1985, had 140 hotels in China across nine brands at the end of 2013, and there are at least 80 more Chinese properties in its pipeline.InterContinental Hotels Group opened the Holiday Inn Lido in Beijing in 1984. It now has more than 200 hotels across five brands in China and 150 more under development.The oldest international hospitality group operating in China, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., better known by its sole brand, Peninsula, opened its first property in China in 1868. Today it has a grand total of three hotels in the country, in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing.One could see this as a repudiation of the "first mover" advantage, but that would be a very Western way of looking at it: By almost any measure -- scale being the notable exception -- Peninsula is very successful. And from its own corporate perspective, it is in the midst of a warp-speed expansion program, with three hotels in development (Paris, London and Yangon), representing an almost 30% increase in its global portfolio.I've always found Peninsula to be an interesting collection, in part because its reputation is outsized relative to its footprint. I think its strength is that it knows better than any other hospitality brand the difference between identity and standards, and it's a difference with which other, much larger companies struggle.Consistency of delivery is regarded as a fundamental element of brand strength by most Western hotel companies."In hospitality, we like standards," said Nicolas Beliard, general manager of the Paris Peninsula, which is scheduled to open Aug. 1. "Use the guest's name a certain number of times. Answer the phone within three rings. But why? Does that matter more than what you say when you do answer the phone? Or whether you actually get to know the guests well enough to remember their names? "Beliard recalls once going over standards with the staff when he worked at another brand. "The staff thought we were a [cult]," he said.And he sympathized.A discussion of the division between identity and standards is particularly relevant now. Consumer demand for authenticity continues to rise just as the corporate owners of iconic brands expand them as quickly as possible.When I toured the St. Regis in Shanghai, I found a great business hotel that didn't remind me in the least of the original St. Regis in midtown Manhattan. The Orlando Waldorf Astoria is a fine, five-star hotel, but had it been labeled with any of several other luxury brands, I wouldn't have once thought, "This feels like a Waldorf Astoria."But when I'm in a Peninsula, I know I'm in a Peninsula, whether in Beverly Hills, Bangkok, Hong Kong or New York. The age, height and layout of the properties can (and do) vary tremendously. Its rooms can have high-tech touches, its restaurants can embrace modern culinary trends, it can innovate with flexible check-in/checkout times, but in other respects it is superglued to its traditional, conservative, service-focused identity.The Paris property will open 10 years after it was acquired. In part, that's because it's in a historical building, and the French are extremely particular about how old properties are restored, but also because Peninsula is going to great lengths to ensure that the property is worthy of the brand.And the unusually long gestation is not solely due to physical preparation; part of the advance work involves staff training that is at once rigorous and unusually flexible, exacting and nuanced.The problem with standards, Beliard believes, is that they often try to reduce the thorniest and satisfying aspects of hospitality into cookie-cutter shortcuts. "Dealing with other humans," he said, "is the most rewarding, but also the most difficult, part of running a hotel.""In Asia, it's important to smile as a means to reduce tension," he said. And while that might seem a good and authentic "standard" to adopt, he understands that even something as simple as a smile can't be standardized."In some cultures, eye contact is important. In others, it would be inappropriate. Trying to understand the different markets in which we operate, but still act authentically, is the challenge," he said.The Chinese famously bring a long-view approach to challenges; the West moves quickly. Pressures related to ownership expectations tend to influence the Western corporate view, while experience over extended periods is perhaps the dominant factor for the Chinese.We're in a particularly interesting place in history, where technology enables change at an extraordinary pace and Chinese global influence has never been greater. When it comes to speed and tradition, it's not necessarily an either/or situation, and it strikes me that the tradition-bound Peninsula might have unusual advantages during this time of great change and disrupting influences.Email Arnie Weissmann at [email protected] and follow him on Twitter###4175||Empty###4176||Surprise fall in eurozone inflation BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Inflation across the 18-country eurozone has been revised down to its lowest level since October, a development that may ratchet up the pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates further. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/surprise-fall-in-eurozone-inflation-30098915.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article30098914.ece/66e59/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-12f1c112-0e6d-4ebe-aedd-8c4bd4ccc93f_I1.jpg

Inflation across the 18-country eurozone has been revised down to its lowest level since October, a development that may ratchet up the pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates further.

Figures released by the Eurostat statistics agency today show that consumer prices in the eurozone were 0.7% higher in February than the year before. That is lower than the 0.8% initial estimate and takes the annual rate down to the level it was in October.

The rate is also way below the level the ECB targets - it sets its policy to keep inflation just below 2%.

The unexpected drop in the inflation rate is likely to reinforce concerns in the markets that the eurozone may suffer a bout of deflation, or falling prices.###4177||Empty###4178||Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager’s moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.

Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager’s moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.

The past week was particularly extreme. The suicide of an American business executive in Singapore was investigated for possible ties to her Bitcoin investments. A California man fingered as the currency’s mysterious inventor reacted to his sudden fame by asking that journalists buy him lunch. After finishing his meal at a sushi restaurant, he went on to deny any role whatsoever in Bitcoin.

Perhaps the most surprising development was that the virtual currency, despite wild fluctuations in value, continued to weather the mayhem. As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.

"Bitcoin works really well," said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. "All this craziness around Bitcoin isn’t around Bitcoin itself. It’s around the people."

Bitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.

"It’s completely Wild West," said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. "There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing."

Bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.

But criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as "hot wallets." Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.

The most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.

Mt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.

"The (Bitcoin) system and protocol itself was and is still sound," Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. "The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry."

Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Canada, followed with its own bankruptcy this past week, again reportedly because of losses to hackers. Criminals apparently relied on an old trick — once popular against ATMs — of trying to withdrawal money faster than a bank can rectify accounts, allowing what amounts to a double-dipping of available funds.

Hobbyists and speculators built the first generation of systems for storing and exchanging Bitcoin, despite having little of the expertise need to run financial institutions, Green said. "Look at it like somebody built a skyscraper out of wood," he said. "That’s what happened."

Amid the bankruptcies, news reports said that the suicide of a 28-year-old American woman in Singapore may have been related to her job as chief executive of a company that traded virtual currencies, and to her personal investment in bitcoins.

The currency was created by a man who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the name was long thought to be a pseudonym, a Newsweek reporter found the California home of a Japanese American computer engineer who once went by that name before changing it several years ago.

Presented with evidence that he was the Bitcoin inventor, the man appeared to confirm the discovery in an article posted online Thursday. But he recanted — after asking for lunch — when a mob of journalists appeared at his home. Newsweek has said it is standing by its story, which included other evidence and interviews with several of the man’s relatives.

Rising interest in Bitcoin has brought a flood of investments from venture capitalists, allowing for the development of exchanges that, experts say, are more likely to survive the attacks of hackers and other threats to the currency’s stability. The number of merchants accepting bitcoins, meanwhile, has steadily grown, and several cities now have ATMs that trade in them, making exchanges easier.

Bitcoins are traded directly between individuals, without a bank to act as an intermediary. The transactions are recorded on a Web-based public ledger, called a "block chain," that provides a measure of transparency but also allows governments and others to potentially analyze transfers to determine who owns bitcoins and how they are being used. The exchanges are required by laws in the countries where they operate to record who buys bitcoins.

The block chain is scrutinized so carefully that it may be difficult for those who have stolen bitcoins to trade them without being discovered. Experts say it also would be impossible for Nakamoto, the inventor, to cash in any of his personal trove of bitcoins — rumored to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars — without finally and definitively revealing his identity.###4179||Why did this happen?

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1% from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.

Prices on benchmark 10-year US treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78%.

The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.

In the US stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.96 points or 0.5%, to 16,369.76, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points or 0.34%, to 1,871.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.561 points or 0.38%, to 4,319.662. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.2% to $31.16 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6%.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5%, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.5% and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3%.

German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3%, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world’s top commodity buyer.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.

Adding to the day’s concerns, in Crimea unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post, in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.

Russia said the US had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.

On Wall Street, Boeing Co. shares lost 2.3% to $125.62 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.

Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.7% at $23. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice-president, global communications and investor relations.

Chinese Data Weighs On Australian, Canadian Dollars

The Aussie traded 0.4% lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2% at $1.1104.

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning—you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tann, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.

The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.

The US dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that the US job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.75.

In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since 25 June and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.

Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30% in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27% from last year’s levels.

The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 79 cents lower at $108.23. The US oil fell $1.25 to $101.33 a barrel. Reuters

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — Libya's parliament ousted the prime minister in a Tuesday vote of confidence, after his government was embarrassed this week when a militia controlling an eastern port defied Tripoli's authority by trying to sell oil.

The chamber named the defense minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, as an interim prime minister until a replacement for the embattled Ali Zidan is found.

The "no" vote won the support of 121 lawmakers out of the approximately 180 that remain in the legislature, according to lawmaker Hussein el-Ansari.

Zidan, whose ouster had been seen as a matter of time to many Libyans, had no immediate public reaction to the vote.

Zidan was elected in 2012 as the first prime minister after the 2011 overthrow and slaying of longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi.

He has had the backing of the liberal-leaning National Forces Alliance against a bloc led by the Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, although parliament is divided as much on regional lines as ideological ones.

Gaddafi's 40-year rule left Libya with few strong state institutions, and Zidan has presided over a government that has little authority and is frequently subjected to humiliations. In the absence of a strong military and police force, it relies on militias to keep order — but many defy the government, with one of them briefly abducting Zidan himself last year.

The Islamist-led bloc has long wanted to oust him, although until now it could not drum up the votes. It was not clear if parliament changed sides but Zidan in recent days has appeared particularly helpless. He confessed to reporters on Saturday that the nation's military does not carry out his orders and complained that "everyone is working against the government."

The latest crisis is linked to an autonomy movement in Libya's east, home to most of its oil. Several months ago, a militia seized the key port of al-Sidra and in recent days, the group attempted to load oil into a North Korean-flagged tanker that docked there without government permission.

The government said Monday that its forces had taken control of the tanker, but the militia denied this.

Critics have attacked Zidan from all sides: some saying that he did not work hard enough to address the east's grievances, while others accusing him of trying to buy off the eastern militias.

Underlying Libya's crisis is a dispute over the interim parliament, which reached the end of its mandate in February. Islamists want to extend its term while the other bloc wants new elections.

Some Libyans see Zidan's removal as part of a bigger deal leading to the holding of new elections.###4183||Empty###4184||Empty###4185||Investing.com -

Investing.com - Gold prices fell marginally in Asian trade on Monday, awaiting fresh direction after better than expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls data last week that pointed to a steady pace of tapering aggressive monetary easing by the Fed.



On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,334.10 a troy ounce, down 0.31%, after settling last week at $1,338.20, down 1.01%.



Despite Friday's losses, Comex gold prices ended with a 1.24% weekly gain, or $16.60, thanks to advances made earlier in the week on the back of heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S. over Russia's involvement in Ukraine's political crisis.



Silver for May delivery traded at $20.773 a troy ounce, down 0.74%, after settling last week at $20.92.



Gold and silver prices came under heavy selling pressure after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.



The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.



The upbeat jobs report indicated that the Fed is likely to continue to scale back its stimulus program, which has burnished the appeal of the precious metal in recent years.



In the week ahead, investors will be anticipating what will be closely-watched data on retail sales and consumer sentiment for further indications of the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.



Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish bets in gold futures in the week ending March 4.



Copper for May delivery was down 1.24% at $3.045 a pound.



Comex copper prices lost 3.29% on the week as concerns over Chinese bond defaults underlined worries over the health of the Asian nation's economy.



Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing expectations for a 6.8% increase. Imports rose 10.1%, compared to forecasts for an 8% increase.



The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.



A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations, while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts for a 1.9% drop.



The downbeat data highlighted concerns about slowing growth in the world's biggest consumer of the industrial metal.###4186||Empty###4187||Restaurant chains are dropping like flies this week.

On Monday pizza franchise Sbarro dipped into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Following in its footsteps on Friday, sub shop Quiznos announced that it too would sink into bankruptcy as part of a "pre-packaged" deal to cut its debt by more than $400 million, or two-thirds.

Fear not for your local sandwich options, though. All but seven of Quiznos' nearly 2,100 restaurants are franchises. As independently owned and operated establishments, they will continue to be open as usual while the parent company undergoes a restructuring.

“The actions we are taking are intended to enable Quiznos to reduce our debt, execute a comprehensive plan to further enhance the customer experience, elevate the profile of the brand and help increase sales and profits for our franchise owners,” Quiznos CEO Stuart Mathis said in a statement. “Our business plan includes several key elements aimed at supporting our franchisees, including reducing food costs, implementing a franchise owner rebate program, in certain circumstances making loans available to franchisees for restaurant improvements, investing in advertising to improve location awareness, and providing new incentives for prospective franchisees.”

Mathis and the rest of Quiznos executive team hope that the bankruptcy will help them implement these new policies and turn around a flagging business. While other fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera Bread continue to surge, brands like Sbarro and Quiznos have failed to adapt to new tastes and customer behavior.

Health insurance is the most important thing on the face of the earth — more important than food, more important than clothing, or housing, or a job, and certainly more important than cell phones and cable TV, according to the President.

People without health insurance are terrible people – free riders, leaches, irresponsible deadbeats. There is us (the insured) and them (the uninsured). We are good and they are not. Which is why we never bothered to ask them what they might be looking for in a health insurance policy. We passed the law requiring them to buy what we think they should buy.

With this contemptuous attitude towards the people the elite is trying to “help” perhaps it is not surprising that the helpees are not behaving the way the helpers would like them to. Amy Goldstein writes in the Washington Post that “Health insurance marketplaces (are) signing up few uninsured Americans…”

Megan McArdle is even more stark in Bloomberg, “How Not to Help the Uninsured.” She includes a fascinating graph:

We are five months into open enrollment and 56% of the uninsured haven’t even looked into getting coverage, and another 34% looked but declined to buy. Ten percent of the uninsured are newly covered, but 18% of the previously insured are newly uninsured.

Very few of the people who wrote this law have ever been uninsured or even know anyone who has been. They are well educated and gainfully employed. Their entire world-view and values belong to what used to be called the bourgeois state of mind. They obey all the laws, are generally well mannered, save money for their children’s college funds, eat right and exercise regularly. They don’t take risks and they don’t get into fistfights.

They believe that the world would be a better place if everyone were more like them. They are also pretty powerful people, though they may not see themselves that way. They have money and influence, they rank high on Google searches, they write articles that actually get published. They are articulate and respected by their peers.

And they want to do good. They want to leave the world a better place. So they reach out for the levers of influence available to them – usually government – to create policies that will improve the lives of the less fortunate. These efforts range from the annoying, like banning Big Gulp sodas, to Obamacare’s mandate that everyone must buy insurance or be penalized.

The problem is that these people are not much like the rest of America. They may disapprove of Big Gulp sodas but the product is wildly popular in the rest of the country. As Rick Santorum reminded the crowd at CPAC, only 30% of the country will ever graduate from college. That doesn’t make the other 70% stupid or ill-informed, it just means they don’t have the patience to sit in a classroom day after day for years on end being lectured to by pompous buffoons.

Some seven years ago (2007) Duke Law School published an edition of its journal “Law and Contemporary Problems” devoted to “Distributional Issues in Health Care.” It included articles by writers such as Mark Pauly, Mark Hall, Christopher Conover, and Tom Miller, but for me the most interesting article was the Foreword by editors Clark Havighurst and Barak Richman.

They argue that poor and working people are poorly served by coverage decisions made by upper middle-class managers who load up on benefits with little value to lower-income workers — “… lower-income insureds get less out of their employer’s health plans than their higher-income coworkers despite paying the same premiums.” They conclude, “… in health care perhaps more than any other sector, the true interests of consumer-voters are ill-served by the political, regulatory, and legal environment.”

In other words, workers in a corporate environment will accept the coverage provided by upper-class management, but once they are on their own they simply don’t see any value in the super-rich and expensive benefits the elites prefer. But the regulatory structure precludes the offering of anything more modest, so these people vote with their feet and become uninsured.

That was certainly my experience. In the 1990s, after I left my job with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, I went without coverage for five years while I started three separate businesses. I simply could not afford to both start these businesses (which ended up employing 45 people in Northern Virginia) and pay for health insurance. You might not make the same decision, but the 45 people I hired were probably pretty happy that I did. If some sort of catastrophic illness plan had been available I probably would have bought it, but such were not permitted at the time.

I am not alone. Tens of millions of people have made rational decisions to spend their money on things that are more important than health insurance, at least for a time. I could list a couple of dozen people I know personally who have made this decision. Who is to say they are wrong?

In most markets when a large number of people are not buying your product, you look to see how to improve the product to make it more appealing. Only in health care is it considered acceptable to command people to buy what they have rejected. No wonder the elite wants to ban the word “bossy.”###4189||HM Treasury has today announced that Her Majesty The Queen has agreed, on the recommendation of the Chancellor and Prime Minister, to appoint Anthony Habgood as the Chairman of Court, and Dr Ben Broadbent as Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy. In addition, the Chancellor and the Governor have agreed to appoint Dr Nemat Shafik as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England responsible for Markets and Banking.

The appointments of Anthony Habgood and Dr Ben Broadbent are effective 1 July 2014. The appointment of Dr Nemat Shafik is effective 1 August 2014.

Mr Habgood, who was appointed for a renewable term of four years, will succeed current Chair Sir David Lees, who will leave at the end of June. As Chair of the Bank’s Court of Directors, Mr Habgood will lead Court in its responsibility for managing the affairs of the Bank, other than the formulation of monetary policy. Court's responsibilities include determining the Bank's objectives and strategy, and ensuring the effective discharge of the Bank's functions and the most efficient use of its resources. Since the 2009 Banking Act, the Bank has had a statutory objective to protect and enhance the stability of the financial systems of the United Kingdom and the Court, consulting HM Treasury and on advice from the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), determines the Bank's strategy in relation to that objective.

Mr Habgood will also chair the Oversight Committee of Court, which was established by the 2012 Financial Services Act. With a membership consisting entirely of Non-Executive Directors, the Oversight Committee reviews all aspects of the conduct of the Executive of the Bank, including the delivery of policy, the design of and adherence to rigorous processes and procedures, and the monitoring of the institution’s transparency and openness.

As the Bank’s Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, Dr Broadbent will have specific responsibility for the Bank’s research and analysis of the UK economy in support of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decisions, and for the provision and distribution of bank notes that are secure against the threat of counterfeiting.

Dr Broadbent will sit on the Bank’s Court of Directors, the Monetary Policy Committee, and the Financial Policy Committee. He is also responsible for chairing MPC in the event of the Governor’s absence.

As Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, reporting directly to the Governor, Dr Shafik will provide greater focus at the very top of the Bank on these two core policy areas. Dr Shafik will be appointed by the Governor to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) under Section 13(3)(b) of the Bank of England Act 1998 as ‘the person who has executive responsibility within the bank for monetary policy operations’, filling the seat currently held by Paul Fisher, the Bank’s Executive Director for Markets. The Government has indicated its intention to place this appointment on a statutory basis in due course. Once formalised,

Dr Shafik will hold seats on the MPC, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), and the Bank’s Court of Directors. In addition, the Court of the Bank will appoint the Dr Shafik to the Board of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Dr Shafik will therefore join the Governor and the Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe, as a member of all three main policy committees.

In her role as Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, Dr Shafik will be responsible for reshaping the Bank’s operations and balance sheet, including ensuring robust risk management practices and helping to lead the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing by the MPC. She will also oversee the implementation of reforms to the Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework, lead the Bank’s work to build fair, efficient and effective financial markets, and review and strengthen the Bank’s Markets and Banking areas, including a comprehensive review of the Bank’s essential market intelligence function.

Dr Shafik will also be jointly responsible for the Bank’s international surveillance, analysis and engagement. She will represent the Bank in international groups and institutions, including as G7 Deputy and in the Bank’s engagement with the IMF, overseas central banks and the BIS.

Commenting on the appointments, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said:

“I am delighted that individuals of the calibre of Ben Broadbent, Minouche Shafik and Anthony Habgood will be joining the Bank’s leadership group. With a diverse combination of skills and experience, these appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank – one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation for the institution and enable it to meet the challenges and opportunities it faces in maintaining monetary and financial stability.

“I would also like to thank Sir David Lees for the invaluable support and advice he has given to me over the past eight months, and to the Bank’s senior management more broadly over the past five years.

“Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to Charlie Bean for his exemplary contributions to the Bank, and to public service, over the past fourteen years – first as Chief Economist and Executive Director for Monetary Analysis, and since 2008, as Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy. Charlie has played a central role at the Bank during the most challenging of times, and his presence at the Bank, and in international groups, will be greatly missed.”

Mr Habgood said:

“I am delighted to join the Court at such an interesting time. I look forward to working with Mark Carney and my new colleagues.”

Dr Broadbent said:

"I am honoured to be able to continue serving the British public in this new role as Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy of the Bank of England. I have found my role as an external MPC member immensely rewarding, and I look forward to working with Mark Carney, my future fellow MPC and FPC members, and all Bank staff in this new capacity, as we work together to maintain monetary and financial stability.”

Dr Shafik said:

“I am excited to be joining the Bank at such a critical time of institutional change, and I look forward to fulfilling this challenging new role on the Bank’s senior leadership team, as we re-shape the Bank’s balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank’s operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world.”

comments###4190||US consumer sentiment has unexpectedly fallen this month to a four-month low, which indicates household spending may be slow to pick up again from the winter setback.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of sentiment dropped from 81.6 to 79.9 in early March. Economists polled by Bloomberg predicted the measure would rise to 82, while economist polled by MarketWatch predicted a slight drop to 80.8.

The drop, combined with a slight drop in producer prices last month, may be partially related to the weather. In an analysis after the report, Michael Englund of Action Economics said that consumer sentiment “faces headwinds from economic disruptions related to harsh winter weather, Obamacare, and lingering concerns after last year’s mortgage rate spike and government shutdown.”

The Labor Department’s producer price index fell 0.1% in February after the cost of services fell by the most in nearly a year. In the 12 months ending in February, producer prices rose 0.9%, the smallest annual gain since May 2013. Producer prices excluding food and energy costs fell 0.2%.

Much of the U.S. has suffered from very cold temperatures and blizzards, which may also have contributed to weak hiring. If weather is the primary cause, the Federal Reserve will feel more confident about winding down its monthly bond-buying stimulus plan, which began in January.

Among consumers surveyed, the greatest concern was economic outlook, which indicates larger payroll gains that lead to wage growth are necessary to boost spending. Rising home prices, fewer job cuts, and stocks reaching a record should keep sentiment from dropping too far.

While retail sales rose in February and the most recent jobs report showed solid growth, rising gas prices and concern over Ukraine appears to be making consumers gloomier about the economy.

New data has shown that the labor market is starting to improve from the winter weather. The Labor Department found that unemployment claims unexpectedly fell 9,000 to 315,000, which is the lowest level since November. As demand rebounds, hiring may increase.

Payroll expanded by 175,000 in February after a lower gain of 129,000 in January, although the jobless rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6%.

Pay is also showing signs of improvement. Hourly wages rose 0.4% on average to $24.31, which is the largest gain since June. Average weekly pay increased about one dollar. Further gains in the jobs market should help increase demand.###4191||(Newser) – Hackers say the now-bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been less than honest about money lost in a major security lapse. Yesterday, they hacked into CEO Mark Karpeles' blog and Reddit account, announcing that the company had kept currency it claimed was stolen, Forbes reports. They said they'd hacked Mt. Gox's servers, and posted a file full of data suggesting the exchange had a balance of 951,116 bitcoins. Hackers say that points to fraud after the company claimed it lost 750,000 of users' bitcoins.

The authenticity of the document isn't entirely clear, though some Reddit posters noted that personal account information revealed in the file appeared accurate, CNET notes. Still, it's possible that the balance shows money that was already lost in the security breach, reflecting bad accounting rather than theft, the Verge reports. Meanwhile, a bitcoin forum user said he or she was trying to sell 20 gigabytes of stolen information from Mt. Gox—a database that holds user details, including passport scans. "Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses (sic) from gox closure," the user said. The price: 100 bitcoins, or some $63,000, Forbes notes.###4192||Investing.com -

Investing.com - European stocks pushed lower on Wednesday, after weak euro zone industrial production data, while market sentiment remained under pressure amid concerns over an economic slowdown in China, as well as worries over ongoing turmoil in Ukraine.

During European afternoon trade, the EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.99%, France's CAC 40 plummeted 1.30%, while Germany's DAX 30 tumbled 1.28%.

Official data showed that industrial production in the euro zone declined by 0.2% in January, disappointing expectations for a gain of 0.5%. Industrial production in December was revised to a 0.4% drop, from a previously reported fall of 0.7%.

Meanwhile, investors remained cautious amid worries over the outlook for China's economy after data over the weekend showed that exports dropped 18.1% in February and inflation slowed.

Markets were also eyeing the standoff between Russia and the West over Ukraine. Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was to travel to the U.S. to meet President Barack Obama on Wednesday, as diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continued.

On Tuesday, European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said markets had missed some parts of its message on forward guidance last week.

He also said the ECB still had policy options available, including lower interest rates or quantitative easing, if necessary.

Financial stocks pushed broadly lower, as French lenders BNP Paribas and Societe Generale plummeted 2.43% and 2.44%, while Germany's Deutsche Bank lost 1.74%.

Among peripheral lenders, Intesa Sanpaolo slipped 0.22%, while Spanish banks BBVA and Banco Santander tumbled 1.12% and 1.47% respectively.

Elsewhere, Tod's SpA reported worse-than-forecast results, sending shares down 4.79%.

On the upside, Adecco SA surged 5.05% after reporting full-year earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates.

In London, as commodity-heavy FTSE 100 retreated 0.99%, led by G4S Plc, down 4.20%, after the company reported lower-than-forecast quarterly results.

Mining stocks also remained on the downside, as shares in Rio Tinto declined 0.59% and Glencore Xstrata lost 2.16%, while rivals BHP Billiton and Vedanta Resources plummeted 1.38% and 1.56% respectively.

Meanwhile, U.K. lenders continued to track their European counterparts broadly lower. Lloyds Banking tumbled 1.12% and Barclays dropped 1.46%, while HSBC Holdings retreated 1.45% and the Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 2.19%.

In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a lower open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.17% slip, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.18% loss, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.25% fall.###4193||Empty###4194||Empty###4195||Empty###4196||The Bank of England’s stability board is “keeping a beady eye” on Britain’s roaring property market, Charlie Bean has said, amid warnings that the economic recovery is too reliant on house prices and consumer spending.

Mr Bean, the Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy at the Bank, told the North East Chamber of Commerce that there were “unmistakable signs that a robust recovery is under way” in the UK. But he said so far not enough growth was built on the stable pillars of business investment, higher productivity and exports.

“To date much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment,” he said. He pointed out that last year consumer spending rose 2.2pc while housing investment jumped almost 10pc.

He said the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee is aware of the “risk” in rising house prices, rather than house building, and “excessive expansion” in mortgage lending. “For that reason, the Bank’s FPC, which is charged with maintaining the overall stability of the financial system, is keeping a beady eye on the housing market,” he said.

Mr Bean warned it was “still early days” in the effort to ensure the UK recovery is sustained. “For the recovery to be both sustained and sustainable we really want to see three things happen,” Mr Bean said, highlighting business investment, a “revival” in productivity growth and a boost in exports to reduce the UK’s current account deficit.

He argued that business investment was lagging the recovery while confidence returned but he said “there are reasonable grounds to expect that the handover from households to businesses will be realised.”

But on the prospects for productivity Mr Bean said the “picture is murkier”. He noted that output per person-hour worked is more than 15pc below where it would have been if it had continued growing at its pre-crisis rate. This he said was due to “over head labour”, the low rate of pay growth and banks forbearing on loans to weaker businesses but extending credit to more productive enterprises. “The course of productivity is absolutely central to the durability of the recovery,” Mr Bean said.

Mr Bean said that the depreciation of the pound during the crisis - sterling fell 25pc between mid-2007 and the start of 2009 - has led to a boost in exports. But he argued that the level of exports, particularly of services, has “to date been somewhat disappointing.” He said it might be “just a matter of time” before exports grow more strongly but he warned an appreciation of sterling would “not be particularly helpful.”

In terms of the Bank’s efforts to help the recovery, Mr Bean backed Mark Carney’s new rates policy, dubbed “fuzzy guidance” by some economists. He repeated the Governor’s pledge that a rise in interest rates, when it comes, will be gradual.

“It is still early days and the MPC will be doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud,” he said. “But when the time does come for us to start raising Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.”###4197||General Motors’ massive recall action involving more than 1.6 million vehicles has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors, who are examining whether the carmaker is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths.

An unnamed source familiar with the investigation told Reuters that the New York-based probe is in its early stages, but did not provide details about the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability. According to the report, federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first surfaced 10 years ago. GM didn’t comment on the issue.

U.S. attorney Preet Bharara’s federal probe adds to a growing list of authorities examining the recall , including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a U.S. Senate committee and the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee.

In some cases, the faulty ignition switches caused the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicles were traveling at high speed. The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the “run” position. This in turn, switches off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.

GM has recommended owners to only use the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring. The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive, said that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is hosting an enrollment event at the Institute of Public Safety at Broward College on Sunday. The event begins at 9 a.m. and those interested are asked to bring social security numbers or document numbers for immigrants. People also need employer and income information for every family member that needs insurance. Those enrolling should also bring any current health insurance policy numbers.

More than 4 million Americans have enrolled in health care plans, including more than 442,000 in Florida, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Metter is about 60 miles northwest of Savannah.

The IPO plans to raise between $466 million and $533 million, with between $326 million and $373 million going to the company and between $140 million and $160 million for insiders.

Except for 2011, the last five years have been profitable ones for the company, as the chart from King's filing shows:



Management has gained control over some important expense areas. For example, game and technology development R&D in 2013 represented almost half the percentage of revenue of previous years. Sales and marketing, which had grown to 33.6 percent of revenue in 2012, was down to 20 percent last year. Cost of revenue -- the amount the company had to give up to third parties to bring in revenue -- has gone from about 40 percent in 2009 to just under 31 percent in 2013.

The result is a healthy 30 percent of revenue turning into bottom-line profit and rapidly accelerating growth.

There are other numbers that will initially attract investors. According to AP, King's big title, Candy Crush, was "the most downloaded free app on iPhones and iPads in 2013." That represents more than Facebook, Google Maps, and YouTube. And 73 percent of the company's bookings in the last quarter of 2013 came from mobile, which is considered desirable for Internet-based companies, given the move toward mobile devices and online access.

However, games are a fad-based industry, and continuing to ride a wave of popularity is difficult. When Zynga (ZNGA) went public, it also showed strong growth and profit. But its fortunes have faded since as consumers failed to embrace new titles with the gusto they exhibited for older ones.

King emphasizes a development model of autonomous teams that have created a catalog of more than 180 "game IPs" -- including a game's name, mechanics of play, visual expression, graphics, and design. But the ratio of individual titles to hits can be potentially large. For example, Rovio developed 51 titles before Angry Birds brought it wild success.

King has already seen a downturn in the number of monthly unique players (MUPs) it has. In the third quarter of 2013 it had just over 13 million. That dropped to under 12.2 million in the fourth quarter. The previous year didn't see that type of shift, so no one can chalk it up to a natural and predictable seasonality. Revenue, gross bookings, and revenue were also down.###4202||Empty###4203||A snapshot of Obamacare enrollment in seven states suggests the law hasn’t significantly increased competition in health insurance markets, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Monday.



But it has shuffled market share in several states for some insurers, including Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc.



In California, for example, four big insurers have largely carved up the state’s market. The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California’s insurance market is now “moderately concentrated” instead of “highly concentrated,” according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, Calif.-based not-for-profit that focuses on health care.



“There are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,” Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said.



About 5 million Americans had signed up for private health plans through Monday using the law’s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.



In California, WellPoint’s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state’s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state’s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.



State changes



WellPoint also lost market share in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent, Kaiser said in its report. In Connecticut, WellPoint’s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.



Kristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.



Before the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minn., has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state’s exchange, MNsure.



Enrolling customers



Before the health law, the state’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.



The Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering “some of the lowest exchange premiums in the country” for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.



About 95 percent of Americans have a choice of two or more insurance carriers in their state exchanges, Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said in an e-mail. The government said in September that about 25 percent of companies offering plans on the exchanges were new to the individual market.



“All consumers shopping in the marketplaces also have greater transparency where they can compare comprehensive, affordable plans side by side to find the one that best meets their needs,” she said.



Open enrollment for exchange plans closes for 2014 on March 31.###4204||E-Commerce giant Amazon.com ( AMZN ) has announced an increase in its prime membership annual fee to $99 from $79, representing a 25% hike.

Amazon's Prime service that provides two-day free shipping was priced at $79 since its launch in 2005. Recently, Amazon beefed up the service with the addition of online video streaming and the kindle library. Amazon's kindle library includes above 500,000 Kindle titles and more than 40,000 movies and TV episodes for streaming via Prime Instant online video.

The move comes as Amazon is facing intense bottom-line pressure. The increase in shipping costs and fuel price hike forced the company to raise the price. In the last reported quarter, the company's net shipping expenses surged 19% to $1.21 billion. The price hike could negatively impact subscriber growth amid significant competition from Netflix ( NFLX ).

The prime service has been expanding considerably over the years, with new Prime membership signups exceeding more than the company's expectations during peak periods in December. Seeing the strong demand for the service, Amazon could increase the prices without affecting growth to a great extent. Though the number of prime subscribers has not been revealed, analysts expect the online retail giant has 20 to 25 million prime members in the U.S.

This strategic move could help Amazon to improve its top line and margin profile while still generating healthy growth in the future. Additionally, the company's partnerships with major film studios and production houses have helped it to expand its content portfolio faster than its rivals.

Also, Amazon is rumored to be launching a television set-top box (STB) which will stream video content. The STB will not only compete directly with Apple Inc. 's ( AAPL ) Apple TV but also with similar products from Roku Inc. and Boxee Inc., as well as gaming consoles from Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) and Sony Corp. that offer video programming.

We believe the company's ever expanding content portfolio will continue to attract subscribers despite the price rise.

However, significant competition from eBay, Google and other online retailers remain a matter of concern. Additionally, Amazon's continuing investments in fulfillment centers could hurt profitability, going forward.

Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).###4205||DETROIT, March 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Wednesday that even after the vehicles in its ignition-switch recall are repaired, owners should still have only the key and fob on the key ring.

GM has been telling the owners of the more than 1.6 million vehicles with the faulty ignition switches linked to 12 deaths that until the repairs are made only the key should be on the key ring. That remains largely the case after the fix as well, according to a document filed with U.S. safety regulators.

“We recommend that customers only utilize the key, key ring and key fob (if equipped) that came with the vehicle,” GM said in the document filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That was in response to a question about whether customers can put their heavy key ring back on after the repair is completed.

A GM spokesman said after the repair is completed, there is no danger of the problem reoccurring.

Automotive research firm Edmunds.com said while there is anecdotal evidence owners should avoid too much weight on their key rings, there is no industry standard language on that subject.

GM disclosed how it is answering customer questions related to last month’s recall in a “frequently asked questions” document filed with NHTSA.

The Detroit automaker also said in the filing that it will offer loaner cars in some cases and a $500 cash allowance to unhappy owners affected by the recall.

The problems in the affected vehicles in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. GM previously had said there were 13 deaths linked to the faulty ignition switch, but revised that to 12 on Tuesday because it had double-counted one incident.

The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the “run” position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.

GM said in the NHTSA document on Wednesday that it is providing rental or loaner vehicles in some cases.

The company also said it is not buying back affected vehicles if owners ask for that, but is offering a $500 special cash allowance, through April 30, to buy a 2013, 2014 or 2015 model-year vehicle.

“This special cash allowance must be passed on to the eligible customer at the time of the transaction and is in addition to other national and regional offers,” GM said in the filing. “The special cash allowance is not transferable and is intended to assist those customers who are unhappy and may want to trade out of their vehicle or buy a new GM product.

“GM will not market or solicit owners using this allowance,” the company added. “We ask that dealers do not market to or solicit these customers either. This special cash allowance is not a sales tool; it is to be used to help customers in need of assistance.”

On Tuesday, a source said federal prosecutors have opened a probe of GM, examining whether the company is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that led to the recall.

The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. NHTSA previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.

Also on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM’s ignition-switch problems.

GM declined to comment on news of the criminal probe, but has said it is cooperating with regulators and Congress in their probes.

The automaker is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter.

GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from NHTSA, and several analysts have estimated the recall could cost the company $70 million to $280 million.

The automaker has not disclosed what the recall will cost. Analysts agreed that the biggest costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.###4206||By David Morgan

With the clock running down on Obamacare enrollment, the administration sought to persuade young people to sign up for health coverage on Tuesday by telling them how much it hurts not be insured - that is, how much it can hurt the wallet.

Take the humble ankle sprain, one of the most common injuries among young adults under the age of 25. Treating it can cost $2,290. Then there's the broken arm: On average $7,700. And people without health insurance get to pay full freight.

Or as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius put it in a government blog: "This can be a huge financial blow to young people and families alike."

That is the message the administration hopes will be heard by college-age kids and others who do not have health insurance, but could qualify for federal subsidies to help purchase coverage. Some could also qualify for the Medicaid health program for the poor.

Open enrollment ends March 31.

In a promotion aimed at fans of the annual college basketball playoff series known as March Madness, Sebelius' Department of Health and Human Services and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition released data looking at the economic costs of common sports injuries like sprains and fractures - just the sort of thing to send a young person to the emergency room.

Young people are vital to the success of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Obamacare prevents insurance companies from penalizing people who are sick or older. And so the new marketplaces need young people who are cheaper to insure to make up for the higher financial risks posed by others.

But so far, the administration's target audience of people aged 18 to 34 have not been signing up in such large numbers, a trend that could lead to higher insurance costs down the road if it continues.

More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare, according to the administration. But the latest breakdown shows the number of younger adults stuck at 25 percent of the enrollment population, versus the 38 percent target that the administration laid out before last October's botched rollout.

Administration officials say younger people could sign up in huge numbers in the final days of the open enrollment period.###4207||Empty###4208||US stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq up for the first session in five, as investors grappled with the evolving situation in Ukraine but shrugged off concern over weakness in China's economy.

Eberhard Kern, managing director and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India, said, “No other car stands for Mercedes-Benz brand promise more than the S-Class and we are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the art production facility in Chakan, Pune. Quality has all along been the strength of Mercedes-Benz India, and the new S 500 production in India is set to take this success story even further.”

The locally made car sees some changes over the fully imported model. It gets new alloys and a new wood trim on the inside. The steering wheel comes wrapped in leather (instead of wood and leather trim on it), in the rear, the sound system is a Burmester one without 3D surround system and the upholstery is plain leather instead of nappa.

The carmaker also started up an initiative known as the S-class chauffeur training program – a 21-module multilingual course that focusses on enabling chauffeurs to use all the tech available on the new S-class effectively.

The local assembly enables the manufacturer to capitalise on costs and the new Mercedes-Benz S-class is now priced at Rs 1.36 crore (ex-showroom, Mumbai).

Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. "Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan (CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014," say economists at Standard Chartered.

China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.

Copper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.

Quiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.

Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.

Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion. "Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments," says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take - the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.

The latest data from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of 2013. "International banking activity was characterised by lower credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013, mirroring developments in the previous quarter," said the BIS in its Quarterly Review published Sunday . "Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466 billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or 4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres ($35 billion or 1.7%)."

Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. "Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow," write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. "For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine)."

ECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. "It's a very important input in the economic development and inflation development," Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. "When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn't warranted. So we're not happy at the moment." The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.

Below is a Business Insider Q&A with Aurelija Augulyte, a macro strategist at Nordea Markets.

***

BUSINESS INSIDER: To what extent do you think poor weather has impacted this winter's economic data?

35%.

BI: What's the big story that nobody is talking about right now?

AA: Few are talking about the true risks of domestic debt crisis potential in Asia. Asian EM FX is still perceived as a "safe haven" on wrong comparisons with previous classical EM crises. This time is different. Asian EM FX are most overvalued. If they are forced to defend their currencies at some point, this will result in unwelcome tightening of monetary conditions (essentially the reverse of what has been happening until recently, resulting in rapid domestic credit expansion).

BI: Are you optimistic about Janet Yellen as Fed chair?

AA: Yes, she is consistent, and the "Yellen put" should be at work to ensure that any correction in stock markets won't be too deep (up to 15%).

BI: The stock market is roaring back to all-time highs. Do issues in EM not have as big an impact on U.S. markets as people argued a few weeks ago?

AA: They should. But we haven't seen an EM crisis yet - only localized FX adjustments. No big change in credit spreads yet. Thus no spillover to global credit, liquidity premia and volatility. Still pending!

BI: What's something you'll be watching this week and next?

AA: If not watching, then listening to the multiple speeches from Fed members. Their take on recent data weakness. Data-wise I think everything will be seen through the "it's weather, stupid" filter by markets, still.###4216||Managers have voiced caution on China, as the country faces up to its first default of an onshore corporate bond since the market became regulated in the late 1990s.

The Financial Times reported last week that Shanghai-based solar panel manufacturer Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology was on the verge of failing to make RMB89.8m (£8.8m) worth of interest payments on a bond issued two years ago.

The payment was due on March 7 but in a stockmarket notice on March 4 the company said it had raised only 5 per cent of the amount necessary.

Concerns have grown in recent months about the stability of China’s $12trn (£7.2trn) corporate bond market in recent weeks as rumours of potential defaults have spread. In January the Chinese government bailed out a high-yield loan product sold to private investors.

Lu Yu, manager on Allianz Global Investors’ emerging markets equity team, warned that the Chaori Solar bond default could be the catalyst for a short-term equity market crash in China.

“China’s credit bubble is worrisome,” Ms Yu said. “A default would be a wake up call for Chinese banks, but I don’t think Chinese credit is going to have a big crisis like we saw in Europe and the US.

“The Chinese government knows what is going on and the signals are strong that they are taking this very seriously.”

But David Cui, China strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, last week likened the potential default by Chaori Solar to the bailout of Bear Stearns in the US in 2007, a move which Mr Cui said forced investors to rethink their attitude towards corporate debt.

Jupiter’s John Chatfeild-Roberts, head of the group’s Merlin multi-manager team, said China was likely to see further bailouts from the state as the government comes to terms with the private sector’s debt issues.

“The first signs that many of these loans are at risk of default are now appearing and there are a huge number that will need re-financing this year alone,” Mr Chatfeild-Roberts said.

“The most likely outcome is that the central authorities in Beijing will find a way of sweeping these bad loans under the carpet, in order to avoid China suffering from a crisis of confidence.

“The $500m bailout of the Credit Equals Gold No1 Trust is a good example of what we could expect to see more of in the future.”

Yang Kun, a Shanghai-based bond analyst at Guotai Junan Securities, told the Bloomberg news agency: “It shows regulators’ attitude toward defaults has changed and they’re silently permitting defaults. Risk appetite will slump substantially.”

But James Ind, manager of the GLG Total Return fund, said he felt that China had “strong control over its financial system”.

He added: “We don’t see a disorderly bank collapse or local government default as being yet on the cards. Their reform agenda is bold, with far-reaching plans to liberalise the economy.”###4217||The Australian dollar is lower as increased political tension in eastern Europe spoils the market's appetite for riskier assets.

At 1200 AEST on Wednesday, the local unit was trading at 92.95 US cents, down from 93.34 cents on Tuesday.

Russia has reportedly increased its military presence on the Ukraine border, suggesting a possible escalation in the conflict.

Western Union Business Solutions currency strategist Steven Dooley said the possibility of Russian troops moving into Ukraine had encouraged a move into haven assets.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is an ongoing and increasing humanitarian crisis in east Ukraine, which is the kind of language you'd expect just before they roll in the tanks," Mr Dooley said.

"That's one of the mains reasons we've seen weakness in the market."

Mr Dooley said the Australian dollar in the past couple of days mainly had been driven by market sentiment rather than US interest rate expectation.

"This is a bit of a short-term movement back into risk-on risk-off. I think it will soon go back to the major theme, being US interest rate policy," he said.

"But six months down the track it will go back to risk-on risk-off."

Local investors are waiting for the release of Australian employment data for July, due out on Thursday.

The number of people with jobs is expected to rise by 12,000 in July and the unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at six per cent, an AAP survey of 15 economists found.

Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was weaker.

At 1200 AEST on Wednesday, the September 2014 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 96.510 (implying a yield of 3.490 per cent), down from 96.530 (3.470 per cent) on Tuesday.

The September 2014 three-year bond futures contract was at 97.290 (2.710 per cent), level with the previous local close.###4218||The NYT today reports on a study out by the American Public Transportation Association on the jump in 2013 in public transit use.

The trade group said in its annual report that 10.65 billion passenger trips were taken on transit systems during the year, surpassing the post-1950s peak of 10.59 billion in 2008, when gas prices rose to $4 to $5 a gallon.

The ridership in 2013, when gas prices were lower than in 2008, undermines the conventional wisdom that transit use rises when those prices exceed a certain threshold, and suggests that other forces are bolstering enthusiasm for public transportation, said Michael Melaniphy, the president of the association.

The original advocates of banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro collapsing during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well-funded, euro-wide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong euro-wide safety net would be able to bail them out.

During the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That’s why banking union enthusiasts wanted euro-wide support systems.

In the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of banking union that hadn’t previously got much attention, centralised supervision of banks, and nixed the idea of common deposit insurance. It didn’t want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries’ banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a euro-wide safety net for bust banks – though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.

Despite all this, banking union doesn’t have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone doesn’t actually need one.

In 2012 much was made of the “doom loop” that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: bust banks dragged down their governments if the latter had to bail them out; and bust states dragged down their banks if the latter had bought too many of their bonds.

This doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is by euro-wide bailouts. There are better alternatives.

Look, first, at the problem of bust banks infecting their governments. This is only a problem if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they don’t get in trouble in the first place; and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.

That, indeed, is the broad programme that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital, “bailing in” bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down if necessary.

The EU is doing all this too. But it didn’t require banking union to push it forward.

That said, the ECB could speed up some of these initiatives.

First, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what are known as “macroprudential” powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like jack up banks’ capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.

The snag is too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the ECB will have two units – the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity over who is going to do what.

Second, many banks don’t have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt, so that taxpayers don’t have to ride to the rescue.

This can be done without banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations has asked for a global proposal later this year. The ECB should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.

Then there’s the matter of avoiding situations where banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system – and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up “resolution plans” that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the knacker’s yard without too much contagion.

Again, banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the ECB will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks’ resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions – and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is needed to stop the too big to fail phenomenon.

Now look at the other half of the doom loop: how weak sovereigns infect their banks. Yet again, banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can only be dealt with if lenders are told they can’t hold more than a certain amount of their own governments’ bonds.

The ECB would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global regime. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks don’t have such a need to follow suit. So the ECB may, at some point, have to face going it alone.

It won’t be easy for the ECB to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone’s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for purpose.###4221||Empty###4222||Why did this happen?

Game was the most downloaded free app of 2013

Has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012

King plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange

Company has said it expects share prices to be between $21 and $24



Analysts previously estimated company could be valued at $5billion



The firm behind the hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga is hoping to value its company at more than $7.5billion when it floats on the US stock market.

Analysts previously estimated King.com could be valued at more than $5billion when it announced it was planning a debut on the US stock market.

The announcement also prompted predictions it could lead to a flurry of technology company listings this year.



The game, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same colour, was the most downloaded free app of 2013, and the year's top revenue-grossing app.

King.com, the firm behind the mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, is hoping to value the company at $7.5billion when it floats on the U.S. stock market

The game, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app of 2013, and the year's top revenue-grossing app

The company told the Security and Exchange Commission yesterday that it expected to price its shares at between $21 and $24, according to the International Business Times.

It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players need to pay for add-ons or extra lives.

The successful flotation of Twitter in November and a surge in Facebook shares have fuelled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including Spotify, AirBnB and Square, as well as King.



But some analysts have questioned whether King can keep up its breakneck pace of growth, particularly given the difficulty some other games makers have experienced in maintaining success.



Zynga, the maker of Farmville, has seen its share price halve since its late 2011 initial public offering (IPO), while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of its 2010 hit Angry Birds.

The company told the Security and Exchange Commission yesterday that it expected to price its shares at between $21 and $24

'It's (Candy Crush Saga) a hot game and King is a fast-growing company, but obviously you have precedents for these type of companies that have been affected by the boom and bust cycles of the game market,' said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

The IPO prospectus offered a first glimpse into King's money-making machine, which generated $1.9billion in revenues in 2013, or $5million a day.



It posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $825million in the year, up from $28.5million in 2012.



KING IN NUMBERS The firm has more than 180 titles in 14 languages.

The most popular include Candy Crush Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga, Pet Rescue Saga and Bubble Witch Saga.

The biggest hit by far is Candy Crush Saga, which has been downloaded more than 500million times since its launch in 2012.

Overall the firm has over 324million average monthly unique users, as of December 31, 2013, across web, social and mobile platforms.

By comparison, Zynga and Supercell, the company behind Clash of Clans, both earned around $900million in revenues last year.

Adam Krejcik, an analyst at Eilers Research in California, said the results in King's U.S. filing were 'staggering', but noted a slowdown in quarterly revenues at the end of 2013.



'Have we seen peak revenue and bookings for King, or can they make up for declines with other games?' he questioned.

King co-founder and CEO Riccardo Zacconi said the group, which is 48.2 per cent-owned by private equity firm Apax Partners, had so far launched five games for mobile phones and all had attracted substantial fan-bases.



'Mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent,' he said in the prospectus.



'Consumption habits have changed - mobile has meant that people consume more digital content than they ever have before, and they want to be entertained over short periods of time whenever and wherever they are.'



Japanese tech and telecoms group Softbank bought 51 percent of Supercell late last year, valuing the firm at $3billion, or around 6.5 times its 2013 EBITDA.



Applying the same multiple to King's 2013 EBITDA would value the firm at around $5.3billion.

Some analysts have questioned whether King can keep up its breakneck pace of growth, particularly given the difficulty some other games makers have experienced in maintaining success

'The risk here is that the company is valued beyond the $7-$10billion range because it is a hot company,' Mr Schuster said.



'On the first or the second day of trading the company is going to be an expensive buy and if the stock does well in the first month or so there is no room for upside.'



King, which plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'KING', intends to raise up to $500million in the listing, but the amount a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees and the final size of the IPO could be different.



Founded in Sweden in 2003, King was profitable in 2005 and has not had a funding round since September of that year, when it raised €34million ($46million) from Apax and Index Ventures.



In the last few months, it has made more than $500million in dividend payments - including a $217million payout this month - to its board of directors, its top executives and major investors. Index Ventures owns 8.3 per cent of King.

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company’s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don’t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn’t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there’s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke noted. Since she works at a drive-thru location, for instance, she noted that tips go down when it’s cold out and people are less likely to reach out to put money in the secured tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30 years old, said she thinks mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she noted that she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn’t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they’ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.###4227||In the latest episode of the ongoing feud between eBay (EBAY) and billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, CNBC reports that the online auction giant will reject a slate of board nominees proposed by Icahn, raising the stakes in the activist investor’s public battle over ebay’s corporate governance.

Last month, Icahn, who has a 2.15 percent stake in eBay, nominated two of his employees to eBay’s board, which he has accused in recent days of putting its interests ahead of the company. This in reference to the company’s 2009 sale of a majority stake in Skype to an investor group that included Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm. Icahn has accused Andreessen, who is an eBay board member, of a conflict of interest over the deal. Yet on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that “eBay plans to reject Icahn’s directors.”

In a new development, Icahn, who has demanded an inspection of eBay’s records on the acquisition of Skype in 2005, said that John Donahoe’s “inexcusable incompetence” had cost stockholders more than $4 billion since he sold the online phone service prematurely.

“We believe based on evidence we have newly uncovered that Donahoe’s inexcusable incompetence cost eBAY…over $4 billion…I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,” the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.

Icahn insists that eBay spin off its fast-growing PayPal payments business – an idea dismissed by the company.

“PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), etc”, said Icahn, adding that “[t]o win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted – management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.”

Shares of eBay were down 56 cents, or 0.95%, at $58.50 in pre-market trading Monday.###4228||Empty###4229||Bond management firm Pacific Investment Management Company LCC (PIMCO), headed by the legendary Bill Gross, has raised funds worth $5.5 billion to buy toxic assets from banks—the European ones in particular, which have a lot of bad debt to shed and add up to their buffer. PIMCO’s move gains significance in light of the general tendency among investors in the past few years to “reach for yield” in an environment of low interest rates.

The Federal Reserve is obviously to blame. Through its Permanent Open Market Operations (POMO) and Quantitative Easing (QE) programmes, it has manipulated both short- and long-term lending rates. With the American central bank taking over as a major lender in the credit market, fixed income investors have had to stretch beyond their usual comfort zone to invest in other credit securities in their search for higher returns.

The move towards long-term bonds, which usually yield relatively higher rates compared to securities with shorter maturity terms (given the longer dated risk), has been one such. Moving towards credit securities of relatively lower credit quality, like corporate, junk and emerging market bonds, has been another. The most adventurous among investors have ventured into structured products which come with greater risk given their relative complexity.

To give an idea of investors’ current risk appetite, last December amidst fears of the taper, the credit spread on US corporate bonds narrowed to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Notably, even former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke recognized the risk of investors stretching for higher returns early last year, saying “portfolio managers dissatisfied with low returns may ‘reach for yield’ by taking on more credit risk, duration risk, or leverage.” But he went on to downplay the risk it poses to the financial system.

Today, given the pressures of inflation following years of money-printing, interest rates will have to rise at some point. The Fed’s decision to gradually ease QE (which is only one of the many tools the Fed has employed to control the credit market) could mark the beginning of a future of higher rates—or may be not if Janet Yellen backtracks after wobbly economic data. But when rates eventually rise, with the Fed (in terms of ten- year equivalents) owning one-third of the US bond market, the unwinding of credit is likely to be painful. The bond bubble fuelled by the Fed will pop.

Higher rates, combined with inflation (that has remained dormant in the West, at least according to official figures), could mean very bad news for fixed income investors. The effect of higher rates on borrowers is another matter of crucial importance. Meanwhile, covenant-light loans (or cov-lites, characterized by loose lending standards) and municipal bonds are two things to watch out. Cov-lites formed over 40% of total loans issued in 2013, and investments in municipal bonds, despite their low quality, have started to pick up this year—in the hope of a federal bailout—after the Detroit crisis last year.

Also, it may be not just the developed markets that bear the pain. A recent International Monetary Fund paper estimated nearly half the existing (as of 2013) foreign investment in emerging markets debt to have been made in three years since 2010. Emerging market debt—despite all claims of being “priced in”—may not be insulated from the credit unwind in the West.

Investments that catch the imagination of investors in their search for yield are often those that run amok during times of “flight to safety”. Smart money should understand that timing the market during such a collapse is a loser’s game, but PIMCO at the moment seems to be prefixed on the fear of missing out on high yield.###4230||Gold futures have climbed to a six-month high as investors seek to protect their wealth from the ripple effects of financial troubles in China and geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe.

Gold for April delivery, the most active contract, on Wednesday rose $US23.80, or 1.8 per cent, to settle at $US1,370.50 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was the highest close since $US1,386.70 reached on September 9.

Gold prices have gained 14 per cent this year as instability in emerging markets and worries about US economic growth reinvigorated investor demand for the haven asset. Some traders view gold as safer than stocks or government bonds because it isn't linked to a particular country or government.

Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies called on Russia to defuse the situation in Ukraine's Crimea region by reducing troop levels and halting annexation efforts. Russian troops have occupied Crimea since late February. Crimea will vote on Sunday whether to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. The G7 said it won't recognise the results of Crimea's referendum.

"That rhetoric is adding uncertainty and tension into the market, and gold generally does well when there's uncertainty," said Mike Dragosits, a senior commodities strategist with TD Securities.

Gold also drew investor interest as losses in copper prices mounted on worries about China's financial system. Copper futures have slumped 8.2 per cent since Thursday, after China allowed its first corporate bond default on the mainland market. Copper is a popular form of collateral that backs loans in China's shadow banking system. Investors worry that if other companies default on their debt, large amounts of metal will be released onto the market.

"There are global concerns of a Chinese slowdown and people are questioning their ability to transition to a domestic(-driven) economy," said Adam Klopfenstein, a senior market strategist with Archer Financial Services LLC, a brokerage in Chicago.

"When there's fear, people look to get in to gold."

Another sign of gold's renewed popularity is rising gold holdings in exchange-traded funds that buy and store the metal on investors' behalf. SPDR Gold Shares, the world's largest gold-backed ETF, logged a 7.5-metric-ton gold purchase at the end of business on Monday, the largest such inflow since February 13. SPDR Gold Shares currently holds 812.7 tons of gold, up 1.8 per cent from the start of the year.

King Digital Entertainment, maker of the wildly popular mobile game Candy Crush, expects to be valued at as much as $7.6 billion in its initial public offering, according to documents filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That astronomical figure may make your head spin, but the company's CEO has a simple response: Try our games and you'll understand.

In the prospectus filed with the SEC, King Digital Entertainment CEO Riccardo Zacconi talked directly to the reader.

“To really understand what we do, you’ll need to take a short break from reading this document and play one of our games. Never had a go on Farm Heroes Saga? Then why not download it now. Within a minute or two, you’ll understand the basics. And as you progress through the Saga, you will find that we have provided enough additional challenges and twists to keep it fun, but not so hard that you want to stop playing the game altogether,” writes Zacconi. “We call it bitesize brilliance – the perfect way to spend three minutes of free time.”

Related: The Keys to Candy Crush's Success

It’s a pretty bold move: telling financial wonks to stop what they are doing and play a game on their phones. Candy Crush Saga, the company's most popular game, involves moving digital sugar candies around the screen to generate lines of three similar candies in a row. The game is free to play, but users pay for additional content or lives in “microtransactions.”

Zacconi says that a key to the blockbuster success of Candy Crush and similar games, is that they are specially tailored for how people use technology right now.

“People are on the move; they multi-task and live their lives across multiple devices. Consumption habits have changed – mobile has meant that people consume more digital content than they ever have before, and they want to be entertained over short periods of time whenever and wherever they are,” says Zacconi.

The business model depends on users being addicted to the game -- which they are. At the end of December, an average of 128 million users were playing King Digital games every day more than 1.2 billion times per day. By the end of February, just two months later, an average of 144 million daily active users were playing King Digital games more than 1.4 billion times a day. The overwhelming majority of those gaming hours were spent on Candy Crush.

It’s widely expected that King Digital will officially file for an initial public offering in the next month. Lead underwriters include J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, according to the prospectus.

The documents filed today establish the terms for its IPO. The Dublin, Ireland-based company has filed with the New York Stock Exchange to trade under the ticker symbol “KING.” According to the prospectus, King Digital will sell 22.2 million shares for between $21 and $24 per share, raising between $466 million and $533 million. If King Digital is able to debut at the top end of its estimate, that would value the game maker at $7.6 billion.

That’s a huge, eye-popping number, but the company has been growing at an exponential pace. Revenues grew from $22 million in the first three months of 2012 to $602 million in the last quarter of 2013. In the same period, the company went from booking a loss of $1 million to profits of $159 million. And its staff has been growing just as rapidly, going from 144 at the end of 2011 to 665 at the end of 2013.

King Digital admits that it’s struggling to keep up with itself. “We have experienced a period of significant rapid growth and expansion in our operations that has placed, and continues to place, significant strain on our management and resources,” the company said in its investor prospectus. “We cannot assure you that this level of significant growth will be sustainable in the future.”

BEIJING, March 13 (Yonhap) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged the United States on Thursday to focus on mutual interests, admitting some "frictions" in their bilateral ties amid tensions with Washington over Beijing's increasingly assertive naval reach in Asia and maritime disputes with its neighbors.

Speaking at his annual press conference, Li, however, gave a relatively upbeat assessment about the prospect of the relationship between the world's top two economies and militaries, saying, "There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of China-U.S. cooperation. We need to make the most of our complementarity."



China's rise and military modernization have increased tensions with its Asian neighbors at a time when it is embroiled in bitter territorial disputes with Japan and other nations over islands in the East China Sea and South China Sea.###4234||Empty###4235||Empty###4236||Empty###4237||Mt.Gox, up until last month, was the largest Bitcoin exchange until it lost more than 750,000 of its customer’s Bitcoins worth more than a half-a-billion dollars where it then filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and Japan. Mark Karpeles admitted in a court room document that a flaw in their software allowed hackers to steal the digital currency.

Lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada against MT.Gox have opened up a new legal battle front for them and Mizuho, Japan’s second largest bank, which was added to the defendants list on Friday in relation to an existing U.S. lawsuit against Mt.Gox. The suit claims that Mizuho committed fraud by providing banking services to Mt.Gox.

In Canada, a class-action lawsuit is also brewing against Mt.Gox and Mizuho has also been named in this suit. Mizuho has failed to comment thus far on the lawsuits that have been filed in both Chicago and Ontario.

The U.S. suit claims that Mizuho knew that Mt.Gox was committing fraud and did not segregate Mt.Gox funds from that of its customers and also failed to suspend banking services to Mt.Gox resulting in even further losses for the Bitcoin customers.

A leaked recording that has been authenticated proves that Mark Kapeles was asked to close the Mt.Gox account with Mizuho due to compliance issues and that Mizuho wished to cut ties with the exchange. Karpeles had said the Mt.Gox was not willing to cooperate with the request.###4238||By: Eamonn Sheridan

China's first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world's second-biggest economy, sending London copper prices to their lowest in 44 months. Copper is often put up as collateral for lending. Fears that China's economy, the world's second largest after the United States, is slowing triggered gold buying and dampened demand for riskier assets such as equities. "For these last sessions, we have had a very definitive China-led safe-haven bid," said Frank McGhee, head precious metals dealer at Chicago commodities brokerage Alliance Financial LLC. "Gold benefits from China's bond default and the industrial metals are getting whacked on the anticipation that China is slowing much quicker than people thought," he said. Spot gold gained 1.3 percent to $1,367.04 an ounce by 1:59 p.m. EDT (1759 GMT), having reached $1,370.60, the loftiest since Sept. 20. U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $23.80 at $1,370.50 an ounce. Trading volume was about 250,000 lots, 65 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. Wednesday's turnover is set to be its highest since Jan. 29. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are also weighing on appetite for risk globally on a growing chance of western sanctions over Crimea. The Group of Seven advanced economies will demand that Russia halt efforts to annex Ukraine's Crimea region in a statement to be issued on Wednesday. The market is awaiting the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on March 18-19. The U.S. central bank is most likely to announce another $10 billion cut to its monthly bond-buying stimulus, even after a series of U.S. economic data showing that growth has been hurt by harsh winter weather. In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

Relations between Russia and the European Union have been thrown into turmoil by Russia's seizure of Ukraine's Crimea region.



In Brussels, the crisis is likely to intensify efforts to reduce energy dependence on Russia, while Moscow has long sought to curb its reliance on Ukraine as the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe, its biggest market.



Russia has begun building South Stream to carry up to 15 percent of Europe's annual gas demand via the Black Sea by 2018.



But so far the pipeline has not met EU law, which does not allow energy producers and distributors to own the pipelines they use. It also requires bilateral agreements between Russia and the nations through which South Stream will pass to comply with EU legislation.



Oettinger told German newspaper Die Welt, discussions with Russia on the link were suspended.



“I won't accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being, they will be delayed,” Oettinger, a German national, was quoted as saying.



Commission spokeswoman Sabine Berger said he was referring only to political talks, and technical contact was ongoing.



The European Commission has made clear the South Stream pipeline faces a long wait for legal clearance.



Nord Stream to Germany

Russia's major alternative to the Ukraine route is the Nord Stream pipeline, which already ships Russian gas to Germany and avoids Ukraine. Gazprom says the potential to pump more is limited by EU rules on how much access it can have to the Opal link from a northern German landing point to the Czech Republic.



Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January the Commission had agreed to allow Russia 100 percent access.



The EU spokeswoman said the executive had agreed with the German Federal Network Agency to prolong the deadline for a decision on Opal, citing a need for “technical clarifications”.



“The Commission aims for rapid clarification of the remaining issues and will work on this together with the relevant authorities,” she said.



Opal has capacity of 36 billion cubic meters, but industry sources said it has been operating at half that for the last three years.



Russia and the Commission are also at odds over an inquiry into Gazprom's suspected anti-competitive behavior, including overcharging customers and blocking rivals.



A Commission spokesman said the Ukraine crisis would have no impact on this inquiry.



“It's very simple. There is no influence whatsoever. Our investigation is ongoing and continuing as planned,” Antoine Colombani told reporters on Monday.###4245||Empty###4246||BEIJING (AFP) - China's central bank on Saturday doubled the yuan's trading band to two per cent, loosening its grip on the tightly-controlled currency and underscoring efforts to accelerate exchange-rate reforms as concerns mount over the slowing economy.

The move will take effect on March 17, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement, and follows years of international pressure on Beijing to allow faster yuan appreciation.

The change, which follows Beijing's landmark move in April 2012 to double the trading band to 1.0 per cent, is seen by some analysts as a key step towards establishing a market-based exchange-rate system.

China's ruling Communist Party has so far maintained a firm grip on the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), as one of its key tools to control the economy, and due to worries about unpredictable financial inflows or outflows.

Saturday's announcement comes after the central bank engineered a depreciation of the yuan in recent weeks - apparently in an effort to drive out speculators ahead of the band-widening - and follows last month's statement that it was seeking an "orderly expansion" of the trading band as a policy goal.

"In order to meet the demands of market development, increase the strength of the market-determined exchange rate and establish a market-based, managed floating exchange rate regime, the People's Bank of China has decided to widen the floating range of the renminbi against the US dollar," the bank said in its statement on its website on Saturday.

It added that the bank "will further develop the role of the market in the RMB exchange rate formulation mechanism".

In widening the currency's trading band, Chinese authorities "must feel that the economy is in a strong enough position to handle an adjustment and other possible reforms ahead," Mr Paul Mackel, head of Asian currency research at HSBC Holdings, told Dow Jones Newswires.

But China's once-dizzying economic growth has slowed in recent years, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged at a once-a-year news conference on Thursday that the country faces "serious challenges" ahead.

China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.7 per cent in 2013, its lowest level since 1999. And earlier this month, Beijing announced that it was targeting growth of about 7.5 per cent in 2014, the same target it aimed for last year.

Mr Jiang Shu, an analyst at China's Industrial Bank, said Saturday's move was part of a "gradual relaxation" of the currency by Chinese authorities.

"The continuous decline in the renminbi previously - a depreciation initiated by the government to reduce expectations of one-way appreciation - and the government reiterating that the renminbi was close to equilibrium were both previews for the relaxation of the band," he said.

The yuan has risen steadily against the dollar over the past year, but it reversed course last month to drop to an eight-month low - a depreciation that analysts say may have been engineered by the central bank to target speculative funds betting on continued appreciation.###4247||March 11, 2014 1 min read

Got a light? No need. In Colorado, marijuana sales are already on fire.

In its first month since becoming legal, Colorado's 59 licensed pot dispensaries generated more than $14 million in sales, according to figures released by the state's Department of Revenue. That resulted in $3.5 million in state tax revenue, about $2 million of which came from sales of recreational marijuana.

Of course, it's too early for the industry to claim any major victories, and the initial sales surge will most likely taper off. However, the number of Colorado's licensed retail marijuana shops is on the rise. As of late last month, there were nearly 170 registered in the state.

While some banks have been leery of doing business with licensed retail marijuana stores because the sale of pot is still illegal under federal law, the marijuana market in the U.S. -- recreational and medical -- is only expected to grow. One San Francisco-based investor group forecasts that the national market for legal pot could jump to $10.2 billion over the next five years. That's up from a $2.3 billion estimate for this year.

Markets are eyeing more data from China due on Thursday to determine the state of the economy, after a recent bond default and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower.

Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14 percent so far this year on the global uncertainties.

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to USD 1,371.80 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after jumping 1.3 percent on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit USD 1,374.45, its highest since September 19.

Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near USD 1,355 an ounce.

"Given bullion`s technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions," HSBC analysts said in a note.

"Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold."

U.S. gold futures also rose on Thursday, hitting their highest since September 10.

Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at USD 1,375-USD 1,377, a break above which will open the way towards USD 1,433.31, the August 28 high.

The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year.

However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world`s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday - the first decline since February 19.

Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China - the biggest bullion consumer - trading at a discount to spot prices.###4249||Starbucks has been on the forefront of the mobile payments space, rolling out its own mobile payments system back in 2011, and becoming Square's first retail partner in 2012. The company has been championing digital payments for years.

Now the company is taking another leap in that direction by announcing an update to its iPhone app on Wednesday that will allow users to tip their baristas from their mobile device.

Starting on March 19th, customers using the Starbucks App for iPhone will be given the option to provide a tip in the three separate denominations: $0.50, $1.00, $2.00. Customers can also choose "no tip" as well.

The feature will be available in 70,000 Starbucks locations across the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

Having worked in a similar environment to Starbucks for a few years, I can tell you that nothing was more annoying that having a steady stream of customers come in, all using credit cards. As well all know, tips only generally happen when someone gets change, so credit cards meant no tips.

Now that mobile payments, like the one introduced by Starbucks a few years ago, have added a further option that requires no cash, Starbucks is throwing a nice bone to its employees.

The Starbucks payments platform allows customers to pay with their smartphones. They can also reload their Starbucks Card balance directly from their mobile device with a major credit card, and even set up automatic reloads.

“With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we’re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a statement.

A screenshot provided by Starbucks seems to indicate that customers do not have to decide right away if they want to tip. In fact, they are given two whole hours to decide (shout out to TechCrunch for catching that one).

Starbucks credits the new feature to its users, who made it a top suggestion on MyStarbucksIdea.com, the company's online community for people to share, vote, discuss and put into action ideas on how to enhance the Starbucks Experience.

UK executives at the games studio behind Candy Crush Saga are set to make millions more than initially thought from the company’s stock market listing, after the developer was today valued at up to $7.56 billion (£4.55 billion)

King, which has a major office near Tottenham Court Road but is domiciled in Dublin, has set a price of between $21 and $24 per share for its New York Stock Exchange listing later this year.

The pricing values King at between $6.6 billion and $7.56 billion, with the top end over $ billion more than initial estimates. If the company floats at the top end of expectations 11 executives at King will be worth a combined $2.2 billion on paper.

King’s London-based chief executive Riccardo Zacconi stands to make up to $745 million from the listing. Zacconi will bank as much as $16.5 million offering shares in the company, while his remaining holding could be valued at $728.5 million.

Yorkshire-based entrepreneur and former Derby County FC director Mel Morris, King’s Chairman, is set to make up to $20.4 million from offering shares, while his remaining stake could be valued at as much as $854.8 million.

King’s management could also see their windfalls reach even higher if the float is over subscribed.

The company hopes to raise $533 million from the stock market listing, with 22.2 million shares being offered. 15.5 million will come from King and its executives, with the remainder offered by existing shareholders.

London-based venture capital firm Apax Partners will make up to $3.4bn, while Index Ventures could be as much as $599 million better off.

King was founded in 2003 by Zacconi and Toby Rowland, son of former Lonrho chief executive and Observer owner Roland “Tiny” Rowland.

The company originally developed small-stakes gambling games for sites such as Yahoo and MSN, before launching games on Facebook and mobile.

Candy Crush Saga, launched in 2012, has been a huge hit for the company and the smartphone version of the game has been downloaded more than half a billion times. The game helped propel it from a loss of $1 million in the first quarter of 2012 to a $159 million profit in the final three months of 2013.

But King admits that a risk to investors is the fact that 78 per cent of all its revenues come from Candy Crush.

China will widen the yuan's daily trading band from the current 1 percent to 2 percent starting next Monday, the country's central bank said Saturday.

Starting March 17, Chinese banks can exchange the yuan in the foreign exchange spot market at 2 percent above or below the central parity against the U.S. dollar announced by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System each trading day, according to the statement from the People's Bank of China (PBoC).

The move will enhance the floating flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate and improve the efficiency of capital allocation, facilitating economic restructuring and beefing up the decisive role of the market in allocating resources, the PBOC said in a statement on its website.

China takes a gradual and steady pace in raising its currency's daily trading limit, from 0.3 percent in 1994 to 0.5 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2012 to the latest 2 percent.

The Chinese yuan experienced continued weakening against U.S. dollar in February, causing widespread concerns over its domestic and international impacts to trade and the financial sector. < The widening of the trading band will not lead to steep depreciation of the Chinese yuan, the statement said, citing improving balance of payments and rich foreign exchange deposit.

The central bank respects the market rule and their reactions and mainly focuses on mid-term changes of the yuan's exchange rate, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of PBoC, said last week.

It will prompt enterprises and residents to pay more attention to the exhange rate's role in allocating market resources, the statement said.

PBoC will further push the liberalization of yuan's exhange rate and diversify foreign exchange products to build a market-guided and properly regulated floating exchange rate system, the statement added.

The central parity rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar is based on a weighted average of prices before the opening of the market each business day.

(Source:Xinhua)###4253||Public pension programmes around the world are in financial trouble. Because of continuing increases in life expectancy, the number of eligible retirees is rising more rapidly than the tax revenue available to finance benefits.

In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office projects the relative cost of the programme's old-age pension benefits to rise by more than a quarter over the next 25 years, from 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product, or GDP, today to 6.2 per cent in 2038. Because the taxes that are earmarked to support do not automatically rise faster than GDP, either the growth rate of benefits must be reduced or tax rates must be increased.

One reason for the rapid rise in benefits stems from how they are adjusted for Under current law, retirees' benefits are automatically adjusted to account for increases in the traditional consumer price index (CPI). But experts have long understood that the overstates the true increase in the cost of living, and that the resulting over-indexing of benefits should be fixed.

Part of the problem is that the does not reflect how consumers change the composition of their purchases over time as relative prices change. President Barack Obama's administration initially followed expert advice and suggested that the traditional be replaced by a more accurate measure known as the chain-weighted CPI. Although this would reduce the annual rate of increase in benefits by only about 0.25 per cent, outlays for and other inflation-indexed programmes over the next 10 years would be more than $200 billion lower. Applying the chain-weighted CPI to tax-bracket adjustments would raise more than $100 billion over the same period.

But there is another, more fundamental reason why the traditional CPI overstates the true rise in the cost of living: it does not accurately reflect the introduction of new goods and services or improvements in the quality of existing goods and services. So it is unfortunate that Mr Obama recently withdrew his proposal to change the traditional index, preferring the political gesture of "protecting Social Security benefits" to the more responsible policy of correcting the way that benefits and taxes reflect rising prices.

The Congress responded in 1983 by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 65 to 67. Individuals who want to retire as early as 62 can still do so with an actuarially fair reduction in their benefits. Alternatively, they can work longer and receive higher benefits.

Of course, the decision to increase the age for full benefits was never going to be politically popular. Congress was, therefore, careful to delay the start of the gradual adjustment, applying it only to those below the age of 45 at the time of the legislation, with the higher age to be fully phased in only in 2027.

As a result, the public was generally unaware during the decade after the 1983 legislation that the age for full benefits would eventually rise. When pollsters asked voters whether they would favour an increase in the Social Security age to improve the programme's financial stability, the response was overwhelmingly negative.

But here is the politically important fact: at no time did any member of Congress propose that the legislation be changed to delay or eliminate the rise in the eligibility age for full benefits. Congress acted responsibly to slow the growth of benefits, even though reversing the increase in the eligibility age would have been politically popular.

Since the 1983 legislation was enacted, life expectancy at age 67 has increased by another three years, bringing it to 85. There is every reason to expect life expectancy to continue to rise in the future at the rate of one year per decade.

The obvious solution to the current and future Social Security financing problem is to reprise the 1983 legislation by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 67 to 70, with appropriate actuarial adjustments for earlier and later retirements. Because life expectancy at age 67 is roughly 18 years, this would be equivalent to reducing average lifetime benefits by one-sixth (the present value of the benefit reduction is actually higher, given that the reduction comes at the start of the retirement period).

It would be even better to avoid future political posturing by enacting legislation now that automatically raises the eligibility age for full benefits in such a way that average life expectancy at that threshold is kept constant, at 15 years.

Some experts object on principle to an increase in the eligibility age for full benefits, because some low-income groups do not experience the same one-year-per-decade rise in life expectancy. A simple solution to that problem would be to relate the age at which full benefits are paid to each individual's average lifetime earnings.

A more fundamental reform would be to shift from a pure pay-as-you-go system to a mixed system that combines the current benefits with investment-based personal retirement accounts. Such investment-based annuities would be a natural supplement to the lower pay-as-you-go benefits that would result from raising the eligibility age for full benefits.

Obviously, retirees deserve advance notice before benefits are reduced. That is why it is important for the US - and for many countries around the world - to act now to make the changes needed to stabilise future pension finances.###4254||Q4 net profit slumps to $10.5m

Margins narrow to 29.4%

Sales fall 6.7%

American Eagle said business conditions remain “challenging” in Q1

Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters has reported a "highly disappointing" fourth-quarter after earnings slumped and margins narrowed.

In the three months ended 1 February, the company reported a net profit of US$10.5m. This compared to earnings of $94.8m a year earlier.

Interim CEO Jay Schottenstein said the results in 2013 were "highly disappointing" and that while tough macro conditions persisted in its retail sector, the firm's merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations.

"We're taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers," he said.

"Our brands remain incredibly strong and I'm confident in our ability to execute the strategic plan and resume long-term profitable growth."

Nonetheless, gross margin narrowed in the quarter to 29.4% from 41.2%, in part due to increased discounting. Sales also dropped, by 6.7% to $1.04bn.

For its first quarter outlook, the company said business conditions remain "challenging", with severe winter weather contributing to weak demand.

Based on a high single-digit decline in comparable sales, American Eagle said it expects first quarter EPS to be around break-even compared to adjusted EPS of $0.18 last year.

FBR & Co analyst, Susan Anderson, said: "While we like AEO's omnichannel/supply chain initiatives, we believe the business will be under pressure in the near term given the competitive and promotional teen environment.

"We remain on the sidelines until we see margin and SSS stabilization or a more attractive valuation. We believe that the stock will be under pressure from today's results."

It did not update its estimates for U.S. and Japanese growth in the second quarter because one-off factors made it too problematic, it said.Turning to Europe, the OECD saw Germany's quarter-on-quarter annualized growth rate reaching 3.7 percent in the first quarter before slowing to 2.5 percent.France, the euro zone's second biggest economy after Germany, was seen growing only 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year, rising to 1 percent in the second quarter.Outside the euro zone, the British economy was seen growing 3.3 percent in both the first and second quarters.Turning to emerging market economies, the OECD said some were seeing a marked loss of momentum as capital outflows exposed vulnerabilities in some countries.It noted that Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey among others have been forced to raise interest rates to keep capital outflows in check.Meanwhile, weak balance sheets in China raised the risk of a sharp slowdown there, the OECD said.###4259||Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia on Thursday denied a media report that its missing airliner flew on for hours after last making contact, and said Chinese photos that raised hopes of a search breakthrough actually showed no wreckage.

"Those reports are inaccurate," Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said of a Wall Street Journal report that said US investigators suspected the plane had flown on.

The report said data automatically sent to the ground from the aircraft`s Rolls-Royce engines suggested the Boeing 777 was in the air for four hours after its last contact with air traffic control at 1.30 a.m. Malaysian time.

"The last transmission from the aircraft was at 0107 hours which indicated that everything was normal," Hishammuddin said.

The Malaysia Airlines (MAS) jet was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on an overnight flight when it disappeared.

"Rolls-Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS and investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised."

He also said China had told Malaysia that satellite photos released on the website of a Chinese state oceanic agency, apparently showing three large objects in a suspected crash site, were released "by mistake and did not show any debris."

A huge search effort has failed to find any evidence of the plane`s fate despite scouring land and sea for six days.

It has been repeatedly dogged by false leads and conflicting information, drawing mounting accusations that Malaysia is bungling the response.

The effort involves dozens of vessels and aircraft from countries around Asia, plus the United States.

The Chinese agency`s images had prompted Malaysia and Vietnam to dispatch planes to the area in question in the South China Sea to hunt for the suspect objects.

"The publication of the images on the website is an accident," Hishammuddin said, relating a statement he said he had received from China`s ambassador to Malaysia.

He said the Chinese government did not endorse the action and was investigating.###4260||The Starbucks app will soon let you tip your barista and shake to pay.

NEW YORK — Alibaba Group, China’s online commerce giant, confirmed Sunday that it plans to begin the process of becoming a public company in the United States.

In a post on its corporate blog, the company said it aims to be listed on a US stock market to become “a more global company.”

The blog post highlights that the company is on its way toward setting up its long-awaited initial public offering, one that could set records as the biggest ever. Among China’s burgeoning contingent of Internet titans, Alibaba is unique — part eBay, part Google, part PayPal.

Its IPO could eventually raise more than the $16 billion Facebook reaped in its public debut nearly two years ago. Analysts speculate that the company could fetch a valuation well north of $130 billion.

The offering is expected to make some of Alibaba’s executives extremely wealthy, including Jack Ma, the former English teacher who founded the company in 1999.

Alibaba’s offering has drawn virtually all of Wall Street, as banks have regularly courted top officials such as Ma and Joseph Tsai, a former American corporate lawyer who now serves as the company’s executive vice chairman.

According to a person briefed on the matter, the company plans to work with at least five major banks on its planned offering: Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. Citigroup is also expected to play a role, the person added.

The blog post also shows that the company has snubbed its hometown exchange, the Hong Kong stock exchange. The Asian market’s operator has refused to bless Alibaba’s partnership structure, in which a group of insiders will maintain control of the board despite owning a minority of shares overall; the Hong Kong exchange’s rules prohibit dual classes of shares and other arrangements that give shareholders more than one vote per share.

Alibaba said that, at some point, it might be open to a dual listing that includes China.

“We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group,” the company said. “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”###4263||Charleston, SC (29403)

In October 2013 Jos A Bank Clothiers, Inc made an unsolicited $2.3 billion offer to acquire The Men's Wearhouse, Inc, which precipitated a flurry of competing acquisition offers and takeover defences by the competing clothing retailers. Men's Wearhouse ultimately rejected Jos A Bank's offer as undervaluing Men's Wearhouse and instituted a shareholder rights plan with a 10% trigger.

On November 15 2013 Jos A Bank formally withdrew its offer to acquire Men's Wearhouse. After Jos A Bank withdrew its offer, Men's Wearhouse's largest stockholder, Eminence Capital, stated publicly that it was in favour of a transaction between the two companies, and that it would seek to vote out certain incumbent Men's Wearhouse directors if no deal occurred. Shortly after Jos A Bank withdrew its offer, Men's Wearhouse dusted off the so-called 'Pac-Man defence', which was a popular takeover defence tactic in the 1980s, and offered to acquire Jos A Bank for $1.5 billion, or $55 per share. Mirroring Men's Wearhouse's prior response, Jos A Bank rejected the offer as insufficient and lowered the trigger on its shareholder rights plan from 20% to 10%. Men's Wearhouse subsequently raised its unsolicited offer to $57.50, and commenced a hostile tender offer for Jos A Bank shares at that price, with the tender offer set to expire on March 28 2014. Eminence Capital has publicly supported Men's Wearhouse's renewed offer, and has stated its intention to nominate two directors to the Jos A Bank's board. As of this update, Jos A Bank's board is considering this new proposal and has requested that its stockholders not participate in the hostile offer until the board determines how to proceed.

Gox’s U.S. bankruptcy part of a fraud

* Opponents said Karpeles recently moved millions of dollars of bitcoins

* Case may revive criticisms of U.S. shell corporations

By Tom Hals

March 10 (Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.###4268||Herbalife Ltd ( HLF ) finds itself facing yet another accusation by activist investor Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager of Pershing Square, for operating illegally in China, as per media reports. Shares of this nutritionist company fell 1.16% yesterday after the news.

The billionaire investor told his clients that Herbalife is likely violating multi-level market restrictions in China. Ackman pointed to internal documents obtained from a former employee at Herbalife and argued that the company's Chinese operations were identical to its business in other countries such as the United States and Mexico. However, this can be risky for Herbalife as Chinese law prohibits any multilevel marketing structure.

Herbalife responded to Ackman and stated that its business model is in compliance with Chinese direct-selling and anti-pyramid regulations. Earlier in Jan 2014, First Financial Daily, a Chinese newspaper, also suspected that Herbalife adopted illegal marketing practices in China. Later in Jan 2014, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced a formal investigation into the pyramid scheme business model complaints against the company, as per a report by the New York Post.

Over the past 14 months, Ackman has been accusing Herbalife of running a pyramid scheme business model. i.e. it employs deceptive marketing practices for improving business. The company was accused of making money by recruiting new sales people and not from its sales.

Ackman made that claim in Dec 2012 when he unveiled a $1 billion short position in the company's shares. Ackman even sent a letter to its investors on Dec 24, 2013 about the improper recruiting methods adopted by Herbalife.

Reportedly, Ackman tried to lobby Congress members to push for an investigation against Herbalife by state and federal regulators, especially the Federal Trade Commission. Such an attempt shows that Ackman is determined to prove the charges. Herbalife, on the other hand, has been denying all the charges and is confident about its operations.

Herbalife is not the only company, which employs sales representatives to sell its products. Other multi-level marketing companies like Nu Skin Enterprises Inc ( NUS ), USANA Health Sciences Inc ( USNA ) and Avon Products Inc ( AVP ) also follows the same distribution model.

We appreciate the fact that despite allegations numerous attacks on its multi-level marketing model, the company's earnings continue to increase. This signals that the stock has potential and will continue to move higher, going ahead.

Herbalife holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).###4269||WASHINGTON -- General Motors said it saw signs of flimsy ignition switches in the Saturn Ion as early as 2001, three years earlier than the first indications of a defect previously disclosed by the automaker.

According to GM’s filing on Wednesday with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, GM received a report on the "passlock" system for the Saturn Ion's ignition switch in 2001, during pre-production development of the car. The chronology was released to explain a second batch vehicles recalled globally last month.

The report said the ignition switch’s problem was "low detent plunger force," but a change in the design of the ignition switch resolved the problems. GM engineers and outside investigators would later find a similar problem with a Delphi-supplied ignition switch used in 1.6 million vehicles between model years 2003 and 2007.

The problem was fixed when Delphi began using a different detent plunger and spring to increase the torque in the switch.

In a 2003 report, a service technician observed that a car had stalled while driving, and noted that "[t]he owner had several keys on the key ring," and suggested that "[t]he additional weight of the keys had worn out the ignition switch."

In its previous filings with NHTSA, the first warning sign that GM disclosed came in 2004, around the time the Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale.

The fact that ignition switch problems with the Saturn Ion predate problems with the Chevrolet Cobalt also raises questions about why GM did not recall the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion and Saturn Sky at the same time as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

GM recalled U.S. cars in two batches: the Cobalt and G5 on Feb. 13, and the rest on Feb. 25.

GM now is telling drivers to remove all items from their key ring besides the ignition key until the repairs are completed, and that even afterward they should not put anything but the car's key fob back onto the ring.###4270||Empty###4271||ADVERTISEMENT

Chrysler Group LLC plans to hire up to 1,000 part-time employees for Toledo's Jeep plant in order to keep production rolling while giving regular employees more time off.

“Our people have been working a tremendous amount of hours,” Plant Manager Chuck Padden said. “To get them more time off is important to us, to make sure they’re refreshed, and can work safely.”

With record demand for the Jeep Wrangler and the launch of the new Jeep Cherokee late last year, employees are regularly working 60 hours a week. And while employees generally like the overtime, such lengthy stretches can wear on workers.

A company spokesman said Monday that Chrysler has hired 380 temporary part-time employees this year, though 50 have been converted to regular, full-time employees.

Chrysler already has collected applications for the jobs and is not currently accepting any more.

Most of the new hires will get between 10 and 30 hours per week.

The TPT employees are paid $15.78 an hour, the rate same as new full-time hires. They’re also offered limited benefits, including health insurance.###4272||Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its US joint-venture stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create Spain's top integrated services provider.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao in a statement.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

The transaction, worth the equivalent of £6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

The statement meanwhile followed weekend media reports that Vodafone had reached a deal.###4273||The euro hit a new 2-1/2 year high against the dollar on Thursday as concerns over Chinese growth and political tensions in Ukraine took the fizz out of an attempted rebound in riskier assets, Reuters reports.

The euro reached USD 1.3967 and looked set to test psychological resistance at a $1.40, in a possible sign that the currency is regaining safe-haven status following the currency bloc's prolonged sovereign debt crisis.

The euro zone's economic recovery seems to be picking up steam even as the European Central Bank resists pressure to ease policy further to counter deflation risks.

"The policy messages and data support the euro and we think that will allow it to continue to push higher from here," said Ian Stannard, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in London.

China's industrial output growth came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries that growth could slow as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.

"The China economy is slowing quite sharply, in our view... (although) the lack of inflation and slowing growth does open the door for policy easing," Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said in a note.

The European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.

"Markets are nervous over China and Ukraine, with the latter weighing the most because of the uncertainty of what will happen next and the seeming lack of any coordinated or effective response," Titan Investment Partners trader Darren Sinden said.

"Multiple snowstorms and the polar vortex during the December and January periods resulted in a sharp decline in traffic and, therefore, we were unable to achieve our comparable store sales goals in the fourth quarter," said Brendan Hoffman, the Bon-Ton's president and chief executive officer in a prepared statement.

The harsh winter contributed to a 7 percent drop in fourth-quarter sales at The Bon-Ton Stores, company officials announced Tuesday.

Despite the loss, the company's gross margin rate was slightly better than in the previous year, Hoffman said. And the company's inventory level was 5 percent below the previous year's.

The company also announced that Hoffman will step down due to personal reasons after his contract expires next year.

"I am extremely proud of the Bon-Ton team and what we have accomplished since I joined in 2012," Hoffman said in a prepared statement. "I truly enjoyed working for the company these past two years."

The company's board of directors will undertake a national search to find a new chief executive officer.

The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., with corporate headquarters in York and Milwaukee operates 270 department stores, which includes 10 furniture galleries, in 25 states in the Northeast and Midwest under the Bon-Ton, Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson's, Elder-Beerman, Herberger's and Younkers nameplates.

There are seven Bon-Ton stores in the Lehigh Valley area, including at the South Mall in Allentown and the Palmer Park Mall.

* Sale seen within 12 months, hinge on return of stability

* UniCredit joins ranks of banks exiting Ukraine (Adds quotes and background)

VIENNA, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit has joined the exodus of foreign banks from Ukraine, putting its local unit up for sale in a deal it hopes to wrap up within a year should political and economic turmoil in the country settle down.

The Italian bank’s central and eastern European arm, Bank Austria, said an unidentified suitor had submitted a non-binding offer for the Ukrsotskbank business before the uprising that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich last month.

Talks continued despite unrest and a standoff with Russia, whose forces control the Crimean peninsula.

The sale talks were “of course subject to a normalisation of the political and economic environment, which by the way we are quite confident will take place,” Bank Austria finance chief Francesco Giordano told reporters.

“Naturally the conversation may take somewhat longer and is a bit less certain of execution in the current circumstances.”

The Ukrainian business was valued at 0.7 times equity value, he said. Reclassification of the Ukrainian bank as an asset held for sale and its operating loss in 2013 hit profits by around 250 million euros ($347 million), Bank Austria said.

UniCredit CEE head Gianni Franco Papa said as recently as December that the bank would not walk away lightly from Ukraine, where it merged two units last year to give it around 3.3 billion euros in assets, 435 branches and 6,200 staff.

Raiffeisen Bank International has put plans to sell its Ukrainian business on hold for now.

Among banks which have pared back in Ukraine are Germany’s Commerzbank, which sold its Bank Forum unit in 2012; Austria’s Erste Group, which sold its loss-making unit in 2012; and Sweden’s Swedbank, which sold its subsidiary last year.

Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo said in January it would sell its Ukrainian unit to a unit of Ukraine-based Group DF.

Foreign banks that remain may have to choose between cutting their losses or holding on to grab market share.

Ukraine was badly hit by the financial crisis when GDP plunged 15 percent in 2009. Government coffers were depleted by huge debt repayments, efforts to protect the currency and high energy costs.

Support from the International Monetary Fund is seen as critical to shore up Ukraine’s collapsing finances and get its economy back on the right track.

Ukraine’s finance minister has said he hoped the IMF would work on an aid package of at least $15 billion. That figure would be in line with the IMF’s last loan to Ukraine in 2010.###4277||Peter Spence

Shares in nutritional supplement company Herbalife have resumed trading some 13 per cent lower, after being halted.

They were halted after the US company received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Before that halt they were trading up by 4.5 per cent.

The company has said that it "welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of isinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC."

Legendary investor Bill Ackman has repeatedly accused Herbalife of being a pyramid scheme, a charge the company has denied.

Last August Ackman asked regulators to probe a stake taken in the company by roval George Soros. He accused Soros of breaking trading rules over its investment in the company, alleging that Soros' move into Herbalife was flagged to hedge funds in order to drive up shares.###4278||Investing.com -

Investing.com - Asian stock markets fell sharply on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for riskier assets.

During late Asian trade, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged 1.8%, China's Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.86%, Australia's ASX/200 Index closed 0.93% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index ended down 1.01%.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing expectations for a 6.8% increase.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.

A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations, while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts for a 1.9% drop.

Markets in mainland China and in Hong Kong came under heavy selling pressure as shares in the financial sector sold off amid worries about domestic bond defaults.

In Hong Kong, China Construction Bank lost 1.7%, China CITIC Bank shed 1.8%, while Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Minsheng Bank slumped 1.5% and 2.5%.

Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the Nikkei retreated after data showed that Japan's economy grew by 0.2% in the final three months of 2013, down from a preliminary estimate of 0.3%.

On an annualized basis, the country's gross domestic product rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter, down from an initial estimate of 1%.

The yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar, with USD/JPY falling to a daily low of 102.92, moving off the previous session's high of 103.75.

Automakers Toyota and Honda saw shares fall 1.15% and 2% respectively, while index heavyweights Fanuc and Fast Retailing dropped 2.6% and 1.85%.

Elsewhere, in Australia, the ASX/200 Index ended lower as miners came under pressure amid concerns over a slowdown in Chinese demand for raw materials.

Copper producers sold off as prices of the industrial metal fell to a seven-month low. Atlas Iron and Fortescue Metals Group plunged 10.15% and 9.4%, while BHP Billiton dropped 4.15%.

Australian commodity producers are heavily reliant on Chinese demand for raw materials.

Looking ahead, European stock market futures pointed to a mildly lower open. The EURO STOXX 50 futures pointed to a loss of 0.25% at the open, France's CAC 40 futures shed 0.1%, London's FTSE 100 futures indicated a decline of 0.3%, while Germany's DAX futures slumped 0.5%.

Across the Atlantic, U.S. equity markets also pointed to a weaker open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a fall of 0.3%, S&P 500 futures inched down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline of 0.25%.

The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.

The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.###4279||BANK of England governor Mark Carney will today face a grilling by MPs over claims that some of its officials knew about the alleged practice of foreign exchange rate-fixing.

Mr Carney is due to appear before the Treasury Select Committee just days after the Bank suspended an employee over compliance concerns following an internal probe.

His deputy Andrew Bailey has already admitted that claims linking the Bank to the burgeoning forex scandal - which regulators say threatens to match the seriousness of Libor rate-rigging - could prove enormously damaging.

Mr Carney is due to give evidence about the allegations during a marathon three-part session which will also see him questioned over the abandonment of his flagship forward guidance policy on interest rates as well as Scottish independence.

The Bank was dragged into the forex affair - which is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - after a Bloomberg report centring on a meeting between officials and bank traders in 2012.

It was claimed that at the meeting, the traders admitted to the practice of sharing information about customer orders before currency benchmarks are set - an alleged practice at the heart of an ongoing regulatory probe into market manipulation.

They were said to have been told that there was no policy on these communications and that banks should make their own rules.

Mr Bailey stressed during an appearance before MPs last month that the Bank did not condone any market manipulation and that it took the claims very seriously.

Last week, it said it had found no evidence that its staff had been involved in forex manipulation, but revealed it had suspended a member of staff while it investigated compliance with internal control processes.

It has called in law firm Travers Smith to assist with its investigation into what its officials might have known about forex rigging or information-sharing in the market.

The Bank's internal review has so far covered around 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chat room records and more than 40 hours of telephone call recordings.

Regulators worldwide - including the FCA in Britain - are investigating a number of firms and their foreign exchange trading activities as part of a major probe of the three trillion a day forex market.

They are looking into whether currency traders shared information about their positions and knowledge of client orders through instant messages to rig the foreign exchange market in their favour.

FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley told MPs earlier this year that allegations surrounding forex trading were every bit as bad as the Libor rate-rigging scandal, which has cost banks billions in fines.

Mr Carney's three-part evidence session before the Treasury Select Committee will begin with a section on the Banks Inflation Report last month.

The publication of the report saw policy makers abandon the forward guidance policy linking interest rates to unemployment after just six months, as the jobless rate had improved much more quickly than previously anticipated.

Mr Carney said at the time that the economic recovery was neither balanced nor sustainable and that rates would have to stay well below pre-recession levels of around 5 per cent for the next few years.

Deputy governor Charlie Bean said in his latest speech that this was likely to mean rates being at 2 to 3 per cent for some while.

Martin Weale, another member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, has said that they are likely to rise from their current rate of 0.5 per cent - where they have been since 2009 - in spring next year.

The evidence session will also address the economics of currency unions amid debate over the possible implications of a Scottish vote for independence.

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK.

First Minister Alex Salmond's Scottish Government wants to create a sterling zone with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Mr Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to how this is done in the eurozone.

Any arrangement to retain sterling in an independent Scotland would need to be negotiated between the Westminster and Scottish parliaments, he said. The Bank of England would implement whatever monetary arrangements were put in place.###4280||ADVERTISEMENT

The current bull run is not the longest or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the U.S. government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge

NEW YORK — Happy 5th birthday, bull market.

The current bull run is not the longest or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the U.S. government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.

Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index is up 178 percent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.

Its advance has been driven by massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve, a drawdown in debt, and a rebound in corporate profits.

The S&P 500 ended Friday at a record high at 1,878.04. Over the same time span, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 150 percent while the Nasdaq has rocketed more than 240 percent.

A bull market is a rise of 20 percent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 percent or more.

The current bull had a tough start in 2014.

In January, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the U.S. economy.

This month the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Obama and other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.

Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.

There have been 11 bull markets since 1945.

The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October, 1990, and March, 2000. The average bull market lasts 4½ years.

Typically, bull markets end when investors get spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks.

None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet.

The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving and consumer confidence is rising. Inflation also remains low.

Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next 12 months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, stands at 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.

The bull market’s gain is above the average advance of 141 percent for S&P 500 bulls. But it is well short of the 417 percent jump from the 1990s run.

Since starting its advance in March, 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent.

If you’d played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays U.S. aggregate index.

The best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index during the bull market are a drugmaker, a hotel company, and a broadcaster.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an experimental asthma drug, has climbed from $12.40 in March, 2009, to $328.11 on Friday.

Wyndham Worldwide, a hotel and lodging company that owns the Ramada and Days Inn, has soared from $3.10 to $75.70 as demand for hotels revives.

CBS has climbed from $3.09 to $67.40 as advertising revenue increased.

Among stocks still in the S&P 500 index since the start of the bull market, the worst performers are a solar panel maker, a mining company, and a supplier of wholesale electric power.

First Solar’s shares are down from $108.36 to $56.11, a drop of 48 percent. The company has struggled to adapt to sharply lower panel prices.

Newmont Mining has dropped from $37.79 to $24.60, hurt by falling gold and copper prices.

Exelon, the nation’s largest supplier of wholesale electric power, has dropped from $43.84 to $29.82 as electricity prices have fallen.###4281||* Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013

* IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook’s $16 bln in value

* Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge

* Niche players, retail brands also step up competition

By Adam Jourdan

SHANGHAI, March 17 (Reuters) - Alibaba’s dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.

In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China’s internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country’s smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.

China’s biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country’s most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.

An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba’s lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant’s Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.

“In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it’s a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,” said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin’s company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba’s Tmall.

Alibaba’s e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma’s firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.

Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China’s e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China’s legions of smartphone users.

Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm’s e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week.

PEELING AWAY

Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s grocery retailer Yihaodian.

Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba’s market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.

“We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,” said Wang.

Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.

“As a mature Internet brand we’re looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,” Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women’s apparel retailers on Alibaba’s platforms. “We go and sell our products where the consumers are.”

RIVALS RISING

Alibaba’s vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.

JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.

Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in “the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market”, Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.

As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.

“I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,” said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. “It’s not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more.”

Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop’s online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.

Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.

Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart’s global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.

MA VS MA

Alibaba’s Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China’s central bank.

When Tencent launched a “red envelope” feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a “Pearl Harbour attack” on his company’s Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.

Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent’s WeChat.

WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a “killer weapon” for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.

China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country’s mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.

“The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,” said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.

“Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,” said Zhang.###4282||The ObamaCare marketplaces have spurred increased competition among the largest insurers in two of the states with the most enrollees while reducing competition in some smaller states, according to a new study.



ADVERTISEMENT###4283||Commentators were falling all over themselves last week to announce that far from being impotent in the Ukraine crisis, the United States had a very important weapon: growing oil and natural gas production which could compete on the world market and challenge Russian dominance over Ukrainian and European energy supplies--if only the U.S. government would change the laws and allow this bounty to be exported.

But, there's one very big problem with this view. The United States is still a net importer of both oil and natural gas. The economics of natural gas exports beyond Mexico and Canada--which are both integrated into a North American pipeline system--suggest that such exports will be very limited if they ever come at all. And, there is no reasonable prospect that the United States will ever become a net exporter of oil.

U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products are approximately 6.4 million barrels per day (mbpd). (This estimate sits between the official U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) numbers of 5.5 mbpd of net petroleum liquids imports and 7.5 mbpd of net crude oil imports. And so, to understand my calculations, please see two comments I made in a previous piece here and here. My number is for December 2013, the latest month for which the complete statistics needed to make my more accurate calculation are available.)

The EIA in its own forecast predicts that U.S. crude oil production (defined as crude including lease condensate) will experience a tertiary peak in 2016 around 9.5 mbpd just below the all-time 1970 peak and then decline starting in 2020. This level is far below 2013 U.S. consumption of about 13.2 mbpd of actual petroleum-derived liquid fuels. (This number excludes natural gas-derived liquids which can only be substituted for petroleum-derived liquids on a very limited basis.)

So, when exactly is the United States going to drown the world market in oil and thereby challenge the Russian oil export machine? The most plausible answer is never. And, the expected 2016 peak in U.S. production is only about 1.5 mbpd higher than production today. That's really quite small compared to worldwide oil production of about 76 mbpd. And, there's no guarantee that the rest of the world isn't going to see a decline in oil production between now and then. So much for the supposed U.S. oil "weapon" taming the Russian bear.

But what about natural gas? Surely, America's great bounty of natural gas from shale could challenge the Russians. Well, not really. It's true that U.S. natural gas production trended up significantly from its post-Katrina nadir in 2005. But the trend has now stalled. U.S. dry natural gas production has been almost flat since January 2012. The EIA reports total production of 24.06 trillion cubic feet (tcf) for 2012 and 24.28 tcf for 2013, a rise of only 0.9 percent year over year.

Not mentioned by any of the commentators touting the U.S. natural gas "weapon" is that U.S. natural gas imports for 2013 were about 2.88 tcf or about 11 percent of U.S. consumption. So, let me see if I understand this: The plan seems to be to import more so we can export more. And this would change exactly what in the worldwide supply picture?

Certainly, it is true that low U.S. natural gas prices have reduced drilling and exploration dramatically. But prices will likely have to rise above $6 and trend higher as time passes as the easy-to-get shale gas is used up and only the more costly and difficult reservoirs remain. Drillers don't keep drilling unless they can make money and that will require significantly higher prices.

And, here's the kicker. In order to ship U.S. natural gas to Europe or Asia, it has to be liquefied at -260 degrees F, shipped on special tankers and then regasified. The cost of doing this is about $6 per thousand cubic feet (mcf). So, the total cost of delivering $6 U.S. natural gas to Europe is around $12 per mcf. With European liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices mostly below this level for the last five years, it's hard to see Europe as a logical market. Japan would be a better target for such exports with prices moving between $15 and $18 per mcf in the last five years. But a U.S. entry into the LNG market could conceivably depress world prices and make even Japan a doubtful destination for U.S. LNG. And, what if U.S. prices rise significantly above $6?

But all this presupposes that the United States will have excess natural gas to export. As my colleague Jeffrey Brown has pointed out, "Citi Research [an arm of Citigroup] puts the decline rate for existing U.S. natural gas production at about 24%/year, which would require the industry to replace about 100% of current U.S. natural gas production in four years, just to maintain current production."

It seems that U.S. drillers are going to be very, very busy just keeping domestic natural gas production from dipping, let alone expanding it to allow exports. And remember, we are still importing the stuff today!

How many companies will actually risk the billions needed to build U.S. natural gas export terminals to liquefy and load exports that may never appear? I doubt that very many will actually go through with their plans.

What is truly puzzling is that all the information I've just adduced--except the cost of liquefying, transporting and regasifying natural gas--is available with a few clicks of a mouse and a little arithmetic performed on tables of data. I got the cost information on LNG from a money manager specializing in energy investments. And yet, commentators, reporters, and editorial writers don't even bother to check the internet or call their sources in the investment business.

Perhaps the facts have become irrelevant. Only that would explain the current hoopla over the nonexistent U.S. oil and natural gas "weapon" in the face of the all-too-obvious and readily available evidence.###4284||Empty###4285||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes Chief Executive John Donahoe.

The company also said Donahoe’s 2013 compensation fell by more than half to $13.8 million. That largely reflects the board’s decision in 2012 to give him a one-time award of $14.8 million in performance share units, although eBay’s weaker-than-expected financial performance also hurt his pay.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares fell 1.4 percent to $58.22 on the Nasdaq.###4287||The U.S. has taken control of a tanker full of oil loaded from a rebel-held port in Libya, the Pentagon says. The raid by Navy Seals took place in international waters south of Cyprus, said Rear Adm John Kirby. The Morning Glory's evasion of a naval blockade at the eastern port of Sidra prompted Libya's parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last week.

###4288||DARLINGTON, England (Reuters) - The Bank of England could keep interest rates lower for longer if sterling strengthens much more, the Bank deputy governor Charlie Bean said on Monday, in a rare comment by the central bank on the level of the pound.

Bean said that sterling’s current level was “fine”, but that Britain would find it harder to enjoy a solid export-based recovery if the currency strengthened any more.

He also cautioned against getting “too hung up” about exactly when the central bank will raise interest rates from their record low 0.5 percent, after financial markets and other policymakers pointed to spring 2015 as a possibility.

In a speech to local businesses in Darlington, northeast England, Bean said there were clear signs Britain’s economy was on the mend, but that it was “early days” and the trade deficit needed to narrow to put growth on a more solid footing.

“Any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10 percent in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports,” Bean said.

In a question and answer session after his speech, he said a stronger sterling would could reduce inflation because of weaker import prices.

“We would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case.”

Last month Ian McCafferty, who sits alongside Bean on the BoE’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, also said further sterling strength would be a worry and could potentially make the bank delay raising interest rates.

Bean said British exports had been somewhat disappointing - especially in the services sector - although he said there were some more positive stories of businesses bringing back activities that had previously moved offshore.

DON’T GET HUNG UP ON HIKE

Bean also warned against pinpointing spring 2015 as the date when the Bank would raise interest rates.

“(The) market curve implies a first rise in Bank Rate in the spring of 2015, though I should stress that we are likely to learn a lot between now and then about the pace of the recovery, the amount of slack and the evolution of supply, and the impact on costs and prices,” he said.

“So I would counsel against getting too hung up about the precise date at which Bank Rate first rises.”

McCafferty and fellow MPC member Martin Weale had both cited spring 2015 as a possibility for the first rate hike in recent interviews.

Bean said that when the Bank does raise interest rates it will do so gradually, and that rates are likely to remain below their pre-crisis average of around 5 percent “for some time” - perhaps around 2-3 percent, echoing the new forward guidance given by Governor Mark Carney last month.

But Bean did not go quite as far as MPC member David Miles, who last month suggested the “new normal” for monetary policy would be interest rates averaging below pre-crisis levels.

Bean said it was possible the Bank might not sell back all of the 375 billion pounds ($627 billion) of gilts which it bought under its quantitative easing stimulus scheme. Because banks might want to park more reserves at the Bank due to tighter regulation after the financial crisis, the Bank might need to hold more gilts as a counterparty.

“We may not be in a position to sell all of the gilts back, and some of them will of course roll over naturally,” Bean said. The Bank has said it will reinvest the proceeds of maturing gilts while interest rates remain at 0.5 percent, but has not said what it will do after that.

MPC member David Miles also made the point in a speech last month that the Bank might need to hold on to government bonds as collateral for banks’ reserves.

Bean said that although Britain’s economic recovery has so far been driven by household consumption and housing market activity, there were reasonable grounds to believe business investment would take over as a major driver for the recovery.

He also said there was more scope for housing investment to continue driving growth, although perhaps only a little room for the household savings ratio to drop further as consumers save less as a proportion of their income.

The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee was keeping a “beady eye” on the housing market, he added.

“(There) is a risk that increased demand for housing ends up mainly in higher house prices rather than more houses. If associated with excessive expansion in mortgage lending, that may create future financial stability risks.”###4289||I got foreign policy ideas right here.

The biggest victim of the Ukraine crisis – other than the Ukrainians themselves, of course – may be Rand Paul. Since bursting onto the national scene four years ago, he has labored steadily and shrewdly first to shed his kook label, to make himself acceptable to the Party’s establishment, and then to steadily tug its policy agenda in his direction. His high-profile attacks on the Obama administration’s foreign policy agenda have excited conservatives and made traditional hawks do a slow boil.

But the return of a classic Cold War scenario has awkwardly exposed the dissonance between conservatives’ still-strong nationalist impulses and Paul’s isolationism. Paul has an op-ed in Breitbart’s “Big Peace” weakly making the case that Ronald Reagan was more dovish than you think, and pleading against his critics, “splintering the party is not the route to victory.” Concurrently, he has an op-ed in Time laying out his plan of action in Ukraine. The Time op-ed is where Paul truly lets loose his long-suppressed inner kook.

Everything about Paul’s argument is weird. Part of the weirdness is conveyed by the prose, which is bereft of specific facts, repetitive, and reads as if it were run through a foreign-language translation program (“This does not and should not require military action. No one in the U.S. is calling for this … I have said, and some have taken exception, that too many U.S. leaders still think in Cold War terms and are quick to ‘tweak’ the international community. This is true.”)

The most uncomfortable thing about it is watching Paul attempt to steer the Ukraine debate toward appropriately Paul-esque solutions. He begins by endorsing the basic Republican talking points, which revolve around (1) general calls for more tough leadership by Obama; and (2) exporting more natural gas to western Europe. (Steve Mufson explains why the latter would have at best a delayed, very marginal effect.) But Paul adds other ideas, too. Some of them reflect an apparent inability to follow the news, like his ringing call for a boycott of the next G-8 summit in Russia:

The U.S. should suspend its participation in this summer’s G-8 summit and take the lead in boycotting the event in Sochi.

Yeah, this already happened.

Paul goes on to argue, “America is a world leader, but we should not be its policemen or ATM.” So he’s saying the United States should lead the world, but this leadership should not entail any new financial or military commitment? Actually, he’s going farther than that. He’s arguing that American leadership should involve less financial and military commitment. Paul’s plan entails stiffing the Ukrainians:

We should also suspend American loans and aid to Ukraine because currently these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia.

Yes, you read that right – in the face of a massive threat from Russia, the United States should impose financial penalties on Ukraine.

We're going to help you moochers the same way we help moochers right here at home -- by teaching you self-reliance. Photo: Brendan Hoffman/2014 Getty Images

Likewise, Paul demands that Obama “lead” our allies in Western Europe, but proposes we stiff them, too:

I would reinstitute the missile-defense shields President Obama abandoned in 2009 in Poland and the Czech Republic, only this time, I would make sure the Europeans pay for it.

You may be wondering just where this plan to lead our allies by treating them like ungrateful punks is going to work. Let Paul explain:

Russia, the Middle East or any other troubled part of the world should never make us forget that the U.S. is broke.

FYI, we’re not broke, we were never broke, and we’re getting farther away from being broke every year.

If you haven’t figured out where Paul is going with this, the next sentence lays it out:

We weaken our security and defenses when we print money out of thin air or borrow from other countries to allegedly support our own.

Yes, the solution to Ukraine’s trouble is for the United States to adopt the gold standard. Of course.

The painful ideological gyrations on display here show that the much-hyped libertarian resurgence within the Republican Party was never as solid as it appeared. Paul was able to rally Republicans to his side because he could position his anti-drone, anti-surveillance policies as the strongest opposition to Barack Obama. Now Vladimir Putin has created a situation where the most obvious line of attack sits to Obama’s right. News analyses in the New York Times (“Ukraine offers a moment for hawks like Mr. Rubio to reassert themselves”) and the Wall Street Journal (“The Ukraine crisis has given GOP foreign policy hawks a fresh opportunity to reassert themselves”) both reaffirm the hawks-strike-back narrative.

Left unsaid is that the rise of Republican anti-interventionism was a partisan phenomenon, not an intellectual one. During the 1990s, Republicans in Congress assailed the Clinton administration’s military interventions in the Balkans, and George W. Bush ran promising a more “humble” foreign policy. The same dynamic works on Democrats, whose civil libertarian impulses spike during Republican presidencies and recede when a friendly Democrat occupies the White House.

Paul’s foreign policy ideas worked for him when he could exploit partisan fear of Barack Obama. Now his intra-party rivals are exploiting the more obvious line of attack on Obama as a wimp in mom jeans. So Paul is stuck trying to peddle isolationism, the gold standard and telling Europe to pound sand as solutions.###4290||Empty###4291||BEIJING, March 13 -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said that his government will give a priority to the promotion of social fairness and the improvement of people's livelihood.



"We need to meet people's basic living needs, to provide the last resort for people to fall back on in case of special difficulty, and to promote social fairness," Li said at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session, calling them three major tasks for the government this year.



"Those topics related to people's livelihood presents priority on the government's work agenda," he said.



Li said the government will endeavor to make China's medical insurance and basic old insurance schemes "truly portable and transferrable" to further expand their coverage in urban and rural areas.



The government is going to explore the possibility of raising the basic pension benefits at a proper time, he said.



The premier urged all the government employees to put the special needs of the people, such as those who run into special difficulty because of serious illnesses or sudden disasters, on the top of their mind.



"The government needs to take more effective measures to ensure equal opportunities in finding jobs and to level the playing field for people who want to start their own business," Li said.



He also said that the government needs to pay particular attention to education to ensure fairness at the very starting point.



"This year we have set the target of raising the proportion of rural students from poor areas enrolled in key universities and colleges by over 10 percent," he said.



The premier also vowed to further improve the poorly built and low performing schools in China's poor areas.



"The government needs to create conditions to ensure that each and every individual has an equal shot at a better life through hard work and that fairness and justice are truly realized even at the most primary level of society," he said.###4292||Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Underwater sounds detected by a ship searching the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet are consistent with the pings from aircraft black boxes, an Australian official said Monday, dubbing it "a most promising lead" in the monthlong hunt for the vanished plane.

Angus Houston, the head of a joint agency coordinating the search, warned that it could take days to confirm whether the signals picked up by the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield are indeed from the black boxes that belonged to Flight 370, but called the discovery very encouraging.

"Clearly this is a most promising lead, and probably in the search so far, it's probably the best information that we have had," Houston said at a news conference. "We've got a visual indication on a screen and we've also got an audible signal - and the audible signal sounds to me just like an emergency locator beacon."

After a monthlong search for answers filled with dead ends, Monday's news brought fresh hope given that the two black boxes, which contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings, are the key to unraveling exactly what happened to Flight 370 and why.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammudin Hussein told reporters that in light of the new information, "We are cautiously hopeful that there will be a positive development in the next few days, if not hours."

There was little time left to locate the devices, which have beacons that emit "pings" so they can be more easily found. The beacons' batteries last only about a month - and Tuesday marks exactly one month since the plane disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board.

The Australian navy's Ocean Shield, which is carrying high-tech sound detectors from the U.S. Navy, picked up two separate signals late Saturday night and early Sunday morning within a remote patch of the Indian Ocean far off the west Australian coast that search crews have been crisscrossing for weeks. The first signal lasted two hours and 20 minutes before it was lost. The ship then turned around and picked up a signal again - this time recording two distinct "pinger returns" that lasted 13 minutes, Houston said.

"Significantly, this would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder," Houston said.

Still, Houston cautioned that it was too early to say the transmissions were coming from the missing jet.

"I would want more confirmation before we say this is it," he said. "Without wreckage, we can't say it's definitely here. We've got to go down and have a look."

The airliner's black boxes normally emit a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz, and the signals picked up by the Ocean Shield were both 33.3 kilohertz, said U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Matthews. But officials contacted the device's manufacturer and were told the frequency of black boxes can drift near the end of their shelf lives.

The Ocean Shield was slowly canvassing a small area trying to find the signal again, though that could take another day, Matthews said.

The ping locator is designed to detect signals at a range of 1.8 kilometers (1.12 miles), meaning it would need to be almost on top of the black boxes to detect them if they were on the ocean floor, which is about 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) deep.

"It's like playing hot and cold when you're searching for something and someone's telling you you're getting warmer and warmer and warmer," he said. "When you're right on top of it you get a good return."

If they pick up the signal again, the crew will launch an underwater vehicle to investigate, Matthews said. The Bluefin-21 autonomous sub can create a sonar map of the area to chart where the debris may lie on the sea floor. If it maps out a debris field, the crew will replace the sonar system with a camera unit to photograph any wreckage.

But that may prove tricky, given that the sub can only dive to about 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) - the approximate depth of the water. That means the vehicle will be operating to the limits of its capability.

Given the difficulties involved, officials warned the mystery of Flight 370 would still take time to resolve.

"It could take some days before the information is available to establish whether these detections can be confirmed as being from MH370," Houston said. "In very deep oceanic water, nothing happens fast."

Geoff Dell, discipline leader of accident investigation at Central Queensland University in Australia, said it would be "coincidental in the extreme" for the sounds to have come from anything other than an aircraft's black box.

"If they have a got a legitimate signal, and it's not from one of the other vessels or something, you would have to say they are within a bull's roar," he said. "There's still a chance that it's a spurious signal that's coming from somewhere else and they are chasing a ghost, but it certainly is encouraging that they've found something to suggest they are in the right spot."

Meanwhile, the British ship HMS Echo, was using sophisticated sound-locating equipment to try to determine whether two separate sounds heard by a Chinese ship about 555 kilometers (345 miles) away from the Ocean Shield were related to the plane. The patrol vessel Haixun 01 detected a brief "pulse signal" on Friday and a second signal on Saturday.

The crew of the Chinese ship reportedly picked up the signals using a sonar device called a hydrophone dangled over the side of a small boat - something experts said was technically possible but extremely unlikely. The equipment aboard the British and Australian ships is dragged slowly behind each vessel over long distances and is considered far more sophisticated.

The search effort was also continuing on the ocean surface Monday. Twelve planes and 14 ships were searching three designated zones, one of which overlaps with the Ocean Shield's underwater search. All of the previous surface searches have found only fishing equipment or other sea trash floating in the water, but have found no debris related to the Malaysian plane.###4293||Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ first jointly designed vehicle, the Dodge Dart , isn’t doing as well as the group wanted to, with sales down 33 percent in the first two months of this year. Consequently, the Belvidere, Illinois plant where the compact sedan is built has sent 325 workers home for a week.

Built on the same architecture as the Alfa Romeo Giulietta , the Dodge Dart fell to ninth place among compact cars in the U.S. market this year, from eighth place last year, overtaken by the Kia Forte. The segment’s leader, the Toyota Corolla, saw 50,000 sales through February, compared to Dart’s 10,000.

Chrysler confirmed the temporary layoffs at Belvidere in a statement to Reuters, but did not give production cut figures. The company only said that the layoffs were meant “to balance vehicle supply with current sales demand.” The plant has approximately 4,500 employees.

Some automotive analysts believe Dart sales are slow because the lacks customer awareness for making small cars, while others believe the Dodge model is under-powered. The 2014 Dodge Dart is available with three engines: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 160hp, a 1.4-liter MultiAir turbocharged four-cylinder with 160hp and a 2.4-liter MultiAir 2 TigerShark four-cylinder developing 184hp.

Adding to the sales problem, there are twice as many 2013 models on dealer lots as 2014 models because of a relatively late model year change. As a result, Dodge in February increased the average incentives discount by $400 from a year earlier, to $2,200 per vehicle.

Ed. Note: In the Reuters report, Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group in Michigan, mentioned that the Dart is underpowered, which doesn’t exactly hold true, as it only applies to sports versions like the 201hp Civic Si or the 210hp VW Jetta GLI. For example, the Corolla is offered with two 1.8-liter units delivering 132hp and 140hp, while the Civic is available with a 143hp 1.8L regular gasoline engine, an 110hp Hybrid and an 110hp Natural Gas edition.

The weaker-than-expected data is bound to amplify global investors' worries about slackening growth in the world's second-largest economy, and will almost certainly feed speculation that Beijing may loosen policies soon to bolster growth.

China's industrial output rose 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014 from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, missing market expectations for a 9.5 percent rise.

That marked the worst performance for China's factory output growth since April 2009.

"Policy easing should be imminent," said Hao Zhou, an economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai, adding that Thursday's data implied that China's economy may grow 7 percent in the first quarter.

Sources told Reuters earlier this week that China's central bank is prepared to take its strongest action since 2012 to loosen monetary policy if economic growth slows further, by cutting the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves.

A cut would be triggered if growth slips below 7.5 percent and towards 7.0 percent, and would be expected only in the second quarter, according to the sources who are involved in internal policy discussions.

Other sectors of the economy also appeared to have lost steam.

Growth in retail sales was the slowest in three years, up 11.8 percent in January and February compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected a rise of 13.5 percent.

Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, fared even worse. It was up 17.9 percent in the first two months from the same period last year, a level unseen in 11 years and some way below forecasts for a 19.4 percent increase.

Asian stock markets and most regional currencies such as the Australian dollar and China's offshore yuan pared early gains after the data was released.

COOLING, BUT HOW FAST?

The statistics bureau released combined data for January and February in a bid to reduce distortions seen in single-month data caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, when factories, offices and shops often close for long periods.

Trade data last week showed January-February exports fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, and tumbled 18.1 percent in February alone, alarming financial markets.

Many analysts believe Beijing will not consider further easing until more months of data are available.

But even accounting for holiday-related shutdowns and distortions, the broader weaker trend so far in 2014 appears clear.

China's government, which wrapped up its annual parliament meeting on Thursday, had said last week that it aims to grow the economy by 7.5 percent this year.

But with growth appearing to drop faster and sharper than what many have expected, some economists believe that China may actually miss its growth target this year for the first time in years.

Even government officials are hinting that the target is not cast in stone, in what may be an attempt to guide market expectations lower. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei and Premier Li Keqiang have both said that the target is flexible.

(China economics team)###4298||After officials said they found no signs of plane wreckage Thursday in an area where Chinese satellite images claimed to show "three suspected floating objects," Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the images were released "by mistake and did not show any debris."

China reported the objects late Wednesday and said they were at a suspected crash site near the airplane’s last confirmed location. The last contact was made halfway between Malaysia and Vietnam at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, less than an hour after the Malaysia Airlines plane took off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

The search effort has been repeatedly dogged by false leads and conflicting information, drawing mounting criticism against Malaysian rescue officials.

Around two-thirds of the flight's passengers were Chinese, and China has been pressuring the Malaysian government to get to the bottom of the plane's disappearance. Premier Li Keqiang, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, demanded that the "relevant party" step up coordination.

On Wednesday, Malaysian authorities said they tracked what could have been the plane changing course and heading west but they remain uncertain about in which ocean to search for the plane.

MH370 'flew for hours'

US investigators suspect that the missing passenger jet stayed in the air for about four hours past the time it lost contact with air traffic controllers, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.

The report said aviation investigators and national security officials had come to this conclusion based on "data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground" from the engines of the Boeing plane, which is part of routine maintenance programs.

The report raises the possibility that the missing Boeing 777 could have flown on for hundreds of additional miles. It also questions whether anyone was in control during that time and under what conditions.

However, the report has been denied by Malaysian officials. "Those reports are inaccurate," Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Thursday. He said the aircraft's Rolls-Royce engines last transmitted data at 1:07 a.m.

"Rolls-Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS and investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised," he added.

Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines said Thursday it would retire the flight codes MH370 and MH371 "as a mark of respect" to the people on board its missing passenger jet.

"Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of our colleagues and passengers of MH370," the national carrier said in a statement.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the , with the Dow futures down by 39 points.

The downward momentum for the markets comes following the release of a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.

With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.

Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.

The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.

Nonetheless, trading on Wall Street may be somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "In the U.S., the important economic data of the week doesn't come until Thursday's retail sales and Friday's PPI, and with commodity prices at the highest level since October '12, inflation numbers should now be a focus."

Among individual stocks, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) may come under pressure in early trading after the household goods retailer warned of weaker than previously estimated fourth quarter results due to adverse weather conditions.

After failing to sustain an initial upward move, stocks turned in a lackluster performance over the course of the trading day on Friday. The choppy trading came despite the release of a relatively upbeat monthly employment report.

The major averages eventually closed mixed for the third consecutive session. While the Nasdaq dipped 15.90 points or 0.4 percent to 4,336.22, the Dow rose 30.83 points or 0.2 percent to 16,452.72 and the S&P 500 crept up 1.01 points or 0.1 percent to 1,878.04.

Nonetheless, the major averages all moved higher for the week due to the substantial rally seen last Tuesday. The S&P 500 jumped by 1 percent, while the Dow and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8 percent.

Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.5 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is just below the unchanged line.

In commodities trading, crude oil futures are sliding $1.27 to $101.31 a barrel after ending almost flat at $102.58 in the week ended March 7th. Gold futures, which rose $16.60 or 1.3 percent to $1,338.20 an ounce last week, are edging up $0.30 to $1,338.50 an ounce.

On the currency front, the U.S. dollar turned in a mixed performance last week. The greenback rose 1.5 percent against the Japanese yen to 103.28 yen but fell 0.5 percent versus the euro to $1.3875. The dollar is currently trading at 103.31 yen and is valued at $1.3883 versus the euro.

Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen's first news conference as Fed chair.

The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.

Will Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke's approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed's economic stimulus?

Or, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?

No major announcements are expected when the meeting ends Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.

The Fed's most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows "well past" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5 percent threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.

Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there's "not a large expectation" that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.

One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they're no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.

"There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate."

Yellen, who was sworn as chair on Feb. 3, has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That's partly why the Fed will likely announce this week a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage spending and growth.

In December and in January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. If the economy keeps improving, the Fed will likely keep paring its bond purchases until ending them altogether in December.

The pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that's depressed growth, to fears about how Russia's aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.

Still, Fed officials, including Yellen, have signaled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign the economy is losing momentum.

The Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth in 2014. Many think the economy, which grew a lackluster 1.9 percent in 2013, will rebound to around 3 percent this year.

"We had a tough start to the year with the winter storms, but it looks like we are starting to pull out of those weather effects," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.

Economists point to several hopeful signs — from a rebound in retail sales to an increase of 175,000 jobs in February despite continued harsh weather.

Even if the economy strengthens and the Fed ends its bond purchases late this year, it will still be stimulating the economy. It has no plans to start selling its enormous portfolio of bonds — a step that would likely send loan rates up. Nor is it likely this year to raise the benchmark short-term rate it controls.

More than five years ago, the Fed cut that rate to a record low near zero, where it's remained since. Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until late 2015.

One reason the Fed may choose this week to drop its mention of a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as a threshold for an eventual rate increase is that Yellen will hold a news conference. Her question-and-answer session with reporters would allow her to explain the Fed's reasoning for any change.

Under a plan established by Bernanke, the Fed's chair holds news conferences after four of the eight meetings each year. The next news conference isn't scheduled until June.

Not all economists expect the Fed this week to drop a link between a specific unemployment rate and an eventual rate increase.

"I don't think they will tweak the language," said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tuft University. "There is enough wiggle room currently."

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.68% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 to October 1, 2018. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Those were the words used by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde on Tuesday to describe the Bank of England's newest member and deputy governor, Nemat Shafik.

Shafik - or Minouche as she is known - will need these qualities if she is to get to grips with the Bank's markets and banking division, which is currently caught up in allegations that it was involved in the rigging of the foreign exchange market . It suspended one of its employees this month, and an investigation into the Bank's conduct is ongoing.

Shafik's appointment is part of a drive to have more women in senior roles at the Bank. It is well known that Mark Carney, the Bank's Governor, and Chancellor George Osborne are looking for more women to serve at the top.

"The lack of participation, especially on the MPC, is striking," Carney wrote in a letter to Osborne dated August 28 last year. "The Bank has a responsibility to foster top female economists all the way through the ranks."

Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Shafik has described her father as an "Anglophone-trained scientist" and her mother as a "Francophone-trained literary type." Surrounded by poverty, Shafik left Egypt at the age of four to begin a new life in America.

In an interview in 2001, she said the "combination of empirical scientific rigor but at the same time being more human and earthy were a big part of my upbringing".

With degrees from Oxford, the London School of Economics and Massachusetts-Amherst under her belt, Shafik quickly rose to become the youngest ever vice president of the World Bank. At the time, she was 36, and responsible for $50bn (£30bn) of investments.

Shafik, now 51, served as a UK civil servant for three years, joining the Department for International Development as Permanent Secretary in 2008, before becoming the IMF's deputy managing director for Europe and the Middle East in 2011. She was also responsible for the Fund's $1bn administrative budget, and human resources for its 3,000 employees.

She is also is used to being in at the deep end. Barely a month after she joined the IMF, and in the middle of negotiations over a second Greek bail-out, she was asked to step in for former IMF boss Dominique Strauss Kahn at a key eurozone meeting, after he was arrested for sexual assault charges.

Of course, Shafik is not the first female to join the upper echelons of the Bank. Dame DeAnne Julius was one of the MPC's founding members, and Rachel Lomax, a former deputy governor, Marian Bell and Kate Barker have all served on the committee.

Charlotte Hogg - the Bank's chief operating officer - was appointed last year to be Carney's "eyes and ears" at the Bank.

However, Shafik is the first female MPC member for four years, and will be only the fifth woman out of 36 current or former members once Andy Haldane - currently the Bank’s executive director for financial stability - joins.

But Shafik has proven she is no wallflower, and is more than capable of adapting to the demands of the job. Perhaps it will be her "superb leadership qualities" - identified by Ms Lagarde - that will one day put her in contention to be its first female governor.###4315||Gold futures fell for a second day on Monday as strong US jobs data backed the case for the Federal Reserve to continue tapering in measured steps, before exiting the program at the end of the year. Meanwhile, assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETF, rose for the first time in eight days on Friday.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for settlement in April fell 0.45% to trade little changed at $1 332.20 per troy ounce by 07:50 GMT. Prices touched a session high at $1 338.60 per troy ounce, while day’s low was touched at $1 328.20 an ounce.

The precious metal capped a fifth weekly gain last week, jumping to more than 4-month high of $1 355.00 per troy ounce on March 3, as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated, spurring demand for haven assets, including gold.

Gold futures are up 11% this year and capped the first back-to-back monthly increase in February since the two-months through August, after a recent unrest in emerging markets, including Ukraine, and signs of slowing US growth, boosted demand for bullion as a store of value.

“The better-than-expected payrolls data weighed on gold, but losses were limited by the political situation in Ukraine,” Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at Everbright Futures Co., said in a Bloomberg interview from Shanghai. “Both ETF and CFTC positions suggest that investors are still willing to hold gold for now,” said Sun, referring to bullion in exchange-traded funds, and bets tracked by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Fed stimulus outlook

Bullion prices were pressured after it became clear that US employers added more workers than expected in February, curbing demand for the precious metal as a store of value.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that nation’s employers added 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last month that central bank’s officials were “open to reconsidering” the pace of reductions in monthly bond purchase, should the economy falter, in contrast with her comments made earlier in February, that US economy has gained enough strength in order to withstand reduction of monetary stimulus.

At the same time, Fed officials will try to determine whether the weakness economy has recently demonstrated is due to temporary factors, before their next policy meeting scheduled for March 18-19th.

“Unseasonably cold weather has played some role,” Yellen said in her testimony in front of the Senate Banking Committee in February. “What we need to do, and will be doing in the weeks ahead, is to try to get a firmer handle on exactly how much of that set of soft data can be explained by weather and what portion, if any, is due to softer outlook.”

The central bank announced in December that it will pare monthly bond-buying purchases by $10 billion, after which it decided on another reduction of the same size at the meeting on policy in January, underscoring that labor market indicators, which “were mixed but on balance showed further improvement”, while nation’s economic growth has “picked up in recent quarters.”

Federal Reserve will probably continue to pare stimulus by $10 billion at each policy meeting before exiting the program in December, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 41 economists, conducted on January 10th.

Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETP, were increased to 805.20 tons on Friday, after being unchanged for seven days, the longest streak holdings have held steady in more than a year. Holdings in the fund are 0.9% up this year after it has lost 41% of its assets in 2013, that wiped almost $42 billion in value. A total of 553 tons has been withdrawn last year. Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson who holds the biggest stake in the SPDR Gold Trust told clients at the end of last year that he wouldn’t invest more money in his gold fund because it isn’t clear when inflation will accelerate. However, a government report revealed that the owner of the largest stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, kept his holdings unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2013.###4316||Breaking News Sign up to get our Breaking News stories in your inbox.

PARIS—A leading international economic body warns global growth could remain sluggish as a slowdown in the developing world undercuts gains in Europe and the United States.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says in an update to November’s World Economic Outlook that developed economies are suffering a temporary slowdown, mainly due to one-time factors like the harsh winter weather in North America. But it said the underlying trend is one of growth.

The OECD said that emerging markets, by contrast, “are experiencing a marked loss of momentum.”

In its report Tuesday, the OECD, a think-tank for the world’s most developed economies, predicts global growth of 3.5 per cent this year from an estimated 2.7 per cent last year.###4321||1888 Views

Tomahawk, WI 03/12/2014 (Basicsmedia) – Share Prices for General Motors Company (NASDAQ:GM) continued to decline throughout the last week, as its delayed Cobalt recall created more than negative buzz for it. The recall has been delayed by over a decade, says National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who also claim that General Motors Inc (NYSE:GM) knew the ignition switch fails under jittery conditions. They are now investigating to find proof of willful neglect in the responding to customer complaints.

Procedural Glitches Also Prohibited Auto-Regulators to Respond To Iterative Complaints

Four days ago, it was revealed in a news report that the auto-regulators dismissed the theory that ignition switch faults in Chevrolet Cobalt are causing deaths despite receiving an average of two complaints per month. The reason they put off a regulatory probe was that the individual complaints never amounted to a “sufficient evidence” to warrant “safety defect” probes. The auto-regulators’ method of identifying the causative pattern of events behind a spree of individually reported car crashes has been criticized in the past also. The Firestone tires in Ford Explorers for example were found to be responsible for 271 deaths in the late nineties, the auto-regulator failed to detect a pattern there also.

GM Stands Committed to Find Fault Within

Over 1.6 million Chevrolet Cobalt cars were recalled a decade after their launch, by CEO Mary Barra. Following up on her hands on strategy, the first-ever female CEO in automakers industry initiated an internal probe. General Motors Company (NASDAQ:GM) has now hired credible external third party investigators to join hands for a transparent probe. The third part investigator Anton Valukas who has credible record of accomplishments; primarily known for his services as a lead investigator in the regulatory probe of Lehman Brothers financial Collapse.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has put a deadline for the internal probe report by the General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM). The US Justice Department has also initiated independent probe which will be lead by the Southern New York Office. Two separate house and Senate committees will also be looking into the matter in their own investigations.

Even more surprising to the media was that Obamacare turned out to be the winning issue for Republicans.

The Democratic congressional candidate outspent the Republican by a million dollars, and it was a district Barack Obama carried in 2012. But the Democratic candidate’s message about Obamacare – “fix, don’t repeal” and “mend, don’t amend” – was a loser, because the American people want Obamacare repealed.

The Democrats thought that Obama’s favorite legislation would be a political advantage by now. It would have given health insurance to millions of voters who never had it before, others would enjoy subsidies and free contraceptives, and all had confidence in Obama’s promise that “if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” (and your health insurance plan, and your hospital).

It must have been a rude awakening for many liberals to realize that it was all a lie, and you really can’t keep your doctor or your insurance plan. Liberals now have to face the fact not only that Obama made a false promise, but that he and his staff knew it was a lie when they wrote those promises on his teleprompter.

Millions of Americans have had their health insurance canceled. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.

Nancy Pelosi told members of Congress they had to pass Obamacare so we can all find out what’s in it. We are finding out more things we don’t like about it every day.

Obama’s game plan to dodge the Obamacare bullet is to announce an exemption or a waiver or a deadline change almost every week. The purpose seems to be to postpone as many obnoxious deadlines as possible so that they do not take effect until after this year’s November election.

The scholar Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute reports that the administration has made 37 significant changes to Obamacare, at least 20 made unilaterally by Obama with his famous “pen.” Only 15 were made legally by Congress.

Obamacare is a disaster any way you look at it. It violates the Constitution by forcing individual Americans to buy things we don’t need or want and to pay for other people to buy products we don’t approve of.

So what do we have to show for the high cost of Obamacare? Lost jobs, full-time jobs cut to part-time jobs, canceled health insurance policies, higher premiums for health insurance, a website that doesn’t work so people don’t know if they are signed up or not, and navigators to help us navigate the website who couldn’t pass a background check.

Don’t miss Phyllis Schlafly’s latest book, now available at the WND Superstore: “No Higher Power: Obama’s War on Religious Freedom”

Obamacare was designed to conceal its extraordinary cost by depending on healthy young people signing up to compensate the insurance companies for the high costs of unhealthy seniors. And we’ve just discovered a previously unnoticed fine-print provision to require taxpayers to bail out the insurance companies if they lose money on that deal.

The Obama administration is trying to save face by claiming that Obamacare’s only problems are with the website or implementation. In fact, the real problem is the socialist mindset that the government can take over a sixth of our economy and do it better and cheaper, and that’s ridiculous because it ends up with higher taxes, more inconvenience and lots of bailouts.

The big-government takeover of an entire industry is driving up health care costs, imposing new taxes, increasing our national debt, encouraging Obama to function like a dictator by changing the law unilaterally and destroying our once-great health-care system.

The administration claims that 4.2 million people have signed up, which is a lot fewer than the original 7 million goal. But the real joker is that many of those haven’t paid their first premium. Like shopping at the supermarket, they’ve put some items in their cart, but they haven’t yet paid at the checkout counter, so we don’t know the real numbers.

But we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance. The Associated Press reported that at least 4.7 million Americans received notices that their current health insurance policies were canceled, and that’s more than the 4.2 million who have signed up.

Most of Obama’s changes were to help Democratic 2014 candidates who are running away from Obamacare faster than they are running for office. The solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.###4324||PITTSBURGH -- In a final push before the deadline, area officials and groups are hosting Affordable Care Act health insurance enrollment events to get as many people as possible covered.



A report last week from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that more than 4.2 million Americans have selected a marketplace health insurance plan between the time the open enrollment period began on Oct. 1 and March 1. In Pennsylvania, approximately 159,821 people have selected a marketplace plan -- not far from the administration�s goal for 164,800 people to enroll in private plans within the first five months.



The last push to enroll is going on nationwide, and as part of the effort, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-14, Forest Hills, on Monday designated this week as Affordable Care Act Week, with numerous events scheduled throughout the county up to the March 31 deadline.



�On St. Patrick�s Day today, we all have the luck of the Irish, but we can�t count on that luck lasting,� Fitzgerald said in a news release. �As we approach the end of open enrollment, we should all be working together to ensure that our friends, family, co-workers and loved ones are covered. That�s why we�re focusing on this week of enrollment events, so that our residents can act now to provide peace of mind for themselves and their families.�



Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also is planning to launch an enrollment push in the city during a press conference Tuesday with Get Covered America.



The campaign, titled �It�s Your Last Chance to Get Covered!,� will be aimed at engaging thousands of uninsured individuals to help them get quality, affordable coverage by March 31, according to a Get Covered America news release.



In Beaver County, health care navigators and certified application counselors are also working to get the final folks enrolled through several events before the deadline.



Though the current open enrollment period will end March 31, some people, such as those who may have recently lost jobs or health insurance, have extra time.



Some people may also qualify for special enrollment periods throughout the year if they experience certain life events, such as losing or gaining employer coverage or changes in family size.



Those who do not sign up for coverage in time could face a fine that will go up every year, although there are some exemptions, such as for those who cannot find affordable coverage.



The next open enrollment period for 2015 will begin in November.###4325||Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on Sunday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S., more than a week after it filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed that it had lost about 750,000 of its customers\’ bitcoins.

Bloomberg News Mark Karpeles, chief executive of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

Chapter 15 is a chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code that facilitates insolvency cases involving parties in more than one country. Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 in Dallas and is being represented by Baker & McKenzie, which is also the law firm representing Mt. Gox its civil rehabilitation proceeding in Japan.

\”There may be Mt. Gox assets and liabilities in the U.S. — clearly there is at least one lawsuit that we’re already aware of — and to the extent bitcoins with a relationship to Mt. Gox are accessible in the U.S., Mt. Gox wants to invoke the bankruptcy automatic stay,\” said Ira Herman, a partner at Thompson & Knight in New York.

\”The automatic stay will serve to halt attempts including litigation to recover against Mt. Gox or to seize Mt. Gox\’s assets,\” said Herman, adding that the stay doesn\’t apply until a recognition order is entered.

Mt. Gox\’s Chapter 15 filing showed it is seeking relief from two parties in the U.S. with pending litigation: CoinLab Inc. and Gregory Greene, a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit who alleges he lost $25,000 worth of bitcoin. The class-action lawsuit was filed against Mt. Gox and Chief Executive Mark Karpeles on Feb. 28 in Illinois on behalf of all people in the U.S. who held bitcoins in the exchange by the law firm Edelson PC. The lawsuit seeks the return of the customers\’ funds and damages against Mt. Gox and Karpeles.

There is an emergency hearing scheduled for Monday in Texas on Mt. Gox\’s filing, according to Christopher Dore, a partner at Edelson who is working on the case. He refused to comment until after the hearing.

Mt. Gox\’s application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange\’s liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins. The Japanese proceeding, which is similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S., noted the possibility of letting Mt. Gox continue business operations \”in order to increase repayments to our creditors.\”

The bankruptcy filing in Japan came after Mt. Gox abruptly shuttered its website, leaving users unable to trade or access the bitcoins stored in the exchange, and followed days of halts on bitcoin withdrawals.

\”Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community,\” the application for civil rehabilitation in Japan said.

Washington and Beijing have grappled over a range of issues, including human rights, cyber hacking, trade disputes and China’s growing military assertiveness over seas contested with its neighbors.

“It’s a fact that some friction exists in the course of cooperation, but this is the trouble with cooperation,” Li told a news conference at the close of China’s annual parliamentary session on Thursday.

“Of course, China and the United States, because their history and cultural background are different, and their stage of development is different, there are differences on some issues.”

Li did not mention specific issues in U.S.-China relations, steering clear of sensitive domestic and international issues facing China’s ruling Communist Party.

The United States is uneasy about what it sees as China’s effort to gain creeping control over waters in the Asia-Pacific region.

China is in the midst of a sovereignty dispute with U.S.-ally Japan over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.

China also has conflicting territorial claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei across a waterway in the South China Sea that provides 10 percent of the global fisheries catch and carries $5 trillion in ship-borne trade.

For its part, Beijing has expressed concern over the U.S. military “pivot” towards Asia.

Despite the tensions, both sides have an overriding interest in maintaining the health of the world economy.

“As long as we respect each other, respect each other’s core interests and major concerns, control well our differences, have equal consultations, and especially pay particular attention to expanding our common interests, then (we will) be able to enhance the level of our bilateral relations,” Li said.###4333||NEW YORK — Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has won a round in his 15-month fight against supplements and weight-loss products maker Herbalife. The direct seller’s shares tumbled Wednesday after Herbalife revealed that it is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for possible “deceptive practices.”

Since December 2012 Ackman has spent millions waging a public campaign against Herbalife and building up an army of lobbyists, community organizers and members of Congress to push regulators to investigate what he calls a “pyramid scheme,” that makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products they sell. It is a charge that Herbalife has repeatedly denied.

Ackman, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management, holds a whopping $1 billion “short” position in Herbalife, meaning he’s bet that the company’s stock will drop and profits when it does. While short sellers are sometimes demonized for profiting at another’s financial pain, they can play an important role in discovering problems with companies. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital took out a massive bet against Lehman Brothers in 2007, accusing the investment bank of not disclosing all of its potential losses from the housing market downturn. That bet turned out to be right. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, sparking the financial crisis.

So far Ackman’s campaign has had mixed success. The SEC began conducting its own investigation into Herbalife shortly after Ackman’s initial accusations, but so far it hasn’t led to any enforcement action.

The FTC news dinged shares 7 percent on Wednesday, as the stock closed down $4.82 at $60.57. But shares are still up 46 percent since December 2012.

Herbalife said Wednesday that it believes it complies with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully with the FTC.

A brutal winter and an anemic holiday shopping season carved different paths in the fourth quarter for Pittsburgh-area retailers Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. and American Eagle Outfitters Inc.

Dick's benefited from the bad weather and received a bump in its profits in the final three months of the year. American Eagle's profits plunged.

The weather, which shut down stores and kept shoppers at home, exacerbated problems for many retailers who have struggled to separate consumers from their money, but it underscored the growing importance of online retailing.

Challenged retailers have coped with a difficult three months by using discounts to lure shoppers during the holidays and to get them out of their homes and into stores during the winter storms that depressed sales, experts said.

“The winter season wasn't very good — it was good for sporting goods types — but a blow to retailers who sell discretionary items,” said Chris Christopher, director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. “When people see their heating bills, that hurts spending. The only retailers that did well were in e-commerce. In the fourth quarter, it was 6 percent of spending.”

Dick's was helped by a thriving online business and because of demand for winter gear. But snow and cold kept shoppers away from American Eagle.

Dick's stock jumped 4.3 percent, and American Eagle's fell 7.8 percent, as both reported results on Tuesday.

Dick's Sporting Goods

Dick's sales and profit exceeded its expectations, CEO Edward W. Stack told analysts. Cold weather-related products and athletic apparel helped sales increase by 8 percent, he said.

The Findlay-based retailer opened 40 stores during 2013 and expanded its online business, which accounted for 12.2 percent of sales in the 13-week period.

“There are a number of retailers that might not have been happy about (the weather), but we loved it,” said Andre Hawaux, Dick's chief financial officer.

Strong sales also came from licensed apparel and footwear, offset somewhat by declines in hunting and golf.

“Dick's does well during the winter because it sells so much apparel and equipment that can be used outside,” said Burt Flickinger, retail analyst with Strategic Resource Group in New York. “We're going through some tough retail times, so it's really impressive that Dick's can increase sales and profits.”

In its online business, Dick's introduced a website for shoppers who use tablet computers, boosting spending by 12.5 percent per visit. It reduced shipping costs by nearly 10 percent and introduced the ability to ship products from stores, cutting delivery costs. Dick's is testing a shop-online, pickup-in-store capability, Stack said. About 90 percent of Dick's online sales ship for free.

“It's critical that we grow our store base,” Stack said, citing a Forrester Research study that said for every dollar spent online, consumers will spend $5 in physical stores by 2017. “Our own research indicates that customers who shop both in-store and online spend three times as much as a customer who shops in only one channel.”

The retailer plans to open about 50 Dick's stores in 2014, eight Field & Stream stores and one Golf Galaxy.

Customers reacted positively to Field & Stream stores in Cranberry and Crescent Springs, Ky., President Joe Schmidt said. “They've been the most successful openings of any openings we've ever had.”

Dick's said profit rose to $138.6 million, or $1.11 a share, from $129.7 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.95 billion from $1.81 billion for period ended Feb. 1. The year-ago quarter included an extra week of sales.

For February through April, Dick's forecast per-share earnings of 51 to 53 cents, compared to 52 cents a year ago, and sales at stores open at least a year to increase 3 to 4 percent, compared to a 3.8 percent decline a year ago.

Dick's shares closed at $56.67, up $2.34.

American Eagle Outfitters

American Eagle predicted its profit in the February-April quarter will be flat on lower sales. Chief Financial Officer Mary Boland told analysts that winter weather caused about 900 full- and partial-day store closures last month.

“Though we were encouraged by what we saw in the first few weeks of January, sales deteriorated and negative trends continued,” Boland said.

“At American Eagle, their gross margins are getting squeezed as the cost of cotton, leather and accessories has gone up,” Flickinger said. “But most important, student loan debt is in excess of $1 billion, and their core customers are taking out loans, more than just student loans, to pay for rent and food. There's high levels of unemployment in the 15-29 age segment, so even if they want to shop, they don't have disposable income,” he said.

The company's financial year came to a discouraging conclusion on Feb. 1. American Eagle's profit tanked in the fourth quarter on lower sales, heavy discounting and one-time charges.

American Eagle reported net income of $10.5 million, or 5 cents a share, in the year's final 13 weeks, compared with $94.8 million, or 47 cents a share, in the 14 weeks ended Feb. 2, 2013. Interim CEO Jay Schottenstein called the results “highly disappointing.”

“While tough macro-conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations,” he said.

After removing one-time write-offs for inventory and store closings, American Eagle's adjusted net income in the quarter was 27 cents a share, down from 55 cents a year ago. Sales were $1 billion in the quarter, down from $1.1 billion the year before. Sales at stores open at least a year declined 7 percent.

The company fired CEO Robert Hanson in January because of disappointing holiday sales. American Eagle shares closed at $13.10, down $1.11.

Separately, the company reported compensation that two top executives called back to lead the company will be eligible for this year. Schottenstein, who is also chairman, could receive up to $5.9 million in salary, bonus and stock awards. Roger Markfield, who had announced his retirement but will serve as executive creative director, could make up to $12.1 million in salary, bonus and stock awards.

After five months of back and forth, Jos. A. Bank agreed to be acquired by Men's Wearhouse in a deal worth $1.8 billion. Men's Wearhouse will pay $65 per share in cash to purchase its smaller rival.

Men's Wearhouse and Jos have been playing hard to get with one another since October. That was when Jos made the first move and bid for its larger rival. Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer, but it then chased Hampstead, MD-based Jos. A. Bank for months, making three bids for the company. It was rejected by Jos each time before finally scoring the deal today.

"This was an exciting cat and mouse game in a relatively boring, low-growth industry," says Brian Sozzi, CEO & chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors.

While Men's Wearhouse is finally getting what it wants by picking up its smaller suit-selling competitor, Jos A. Bank is the real winner of this M&A saga.

Though Men's Wearhouse was making the most of the bids (it even took a hostile approach in January), Jos. A. Bank was the true aggressor throughout the process. Jos made the first move when it made a bold $2.3 billion bid, and when Men's Wearhouse reciprocated with bids of its own, Jos pushed back hard saying it wasn't interested.

Robert N. Wildrick, chairman of Jos. A. Bank, said back in January, "Our Board of Directors firmly believes that the Men's Wearhouse offer is inadequate and significantly undervalues Jos. A. Bank and its near- and long-term potential."

But even as it continued to reject the bids, Jos was likely interested in a deal with Men's Wearhouse all along. Why? It wanted the best possible offer. "Jos played Men's Wearhouse like a fiddle," Sozzi says.

Jos. A. Bank even went as far as to make an offer for Eddie Bauer in February for $825 million. "They had no intention of buying Eddie Bauer. It was an effort to get the last dime out of Men's Wearhouse," Sozzi addds.

It worked.

Less than two weeks later, Men's Wearhouse increased its offer to $63.50 per share from its previous $57.50 offer. Days later, Jos was ready to talk and agreed to exchange confidential financials with Men's Wearhouse. Today's deal has Men's Wearhouse paying $65.00, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. That's up from the first offer from Men's Wearhouse at $55 per share, which represented an implied enterprise value of approximately $1.2 billion.

"This was Jos. A. Bank's show and Men's Wearhouse was living in it," says Sozzi, who predicted in October the two retailers would eventually agree to a deal.

The agreement is giving shareholders of both companies something to cheer about. Jos shares are up 3.9% while Men's Wearhouse shares are up 5.2% this afternoon.

James Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings, whose company rates public companies on their financial health, scores them from 0 to 100. Jos. A. Bank and Men's Wearhouse score a 69 and 62, respectively. Gellert says both companies have something to gain in the deal.

"Neither is generating impressive revenue but both have good margins meaning they are good at cost efficiencies," he says. The two companies will have a chance to cut costs further after they merge, specifically in their supply chain, Gellert adds.

There are still more crucial details that will need to be hammered out. Among them: What will the future management team look like? Leadership was reportedly a point of contention during the five-month back and forth.

The press release for today's deal doesn't offer much information on that front. "All of us at Men's Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees," Doug Ewert, President and Chief Executive Officer of Men's Wearhouse said.

"Initially, I thought Men's Wearhouse should lead because it had he stronger brand, but with the way Jos. A. Bank executives handled this deal, I'd rather have them in charge," Sozzi says.###4342||Empty###4343||Empty###4344||LONDON: Gold recovered from early losses to edge higher on Monday as support from the standoff in Ukraine offset pressure from last week's strong US payrolls data and weakness in other commodities after a sharp drop in Chinese exports.

Chinese State TV reports it has satellite images that may lead us to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370. The images are leading CNN's coverage of the hunt for Malaysia Airlines this evening.

However, after days of false leads and conflicting reports, we can't help but be skeptical.

The last round of satellite images that authorities had hoped would lead to debris of the jet turned out to be the mossy cap of a cable and a bundle of logs tied together with string.

Still, China's State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense has announced that its satellites "observed a suspected crash area at sea," which included the "three suspected floating objects and their sizes," according to CNN.

The debris was reportedly first spotted by satellites on Sunday morning, Malaysian time, but not reported until Wednesday. The images show the three suspected floating objects sized (in meters) 13x18, 14x19 and 24 x22. It falls near the area of last transmission, not far from the path the airliner had been traveling on while en route to Beijing.

If the images do in fact lead investigators to the debris of the missing jetliner, it would be a big win for the Chinese government. Beijing has grown frustrated with Malaysian authorities' lack of progress, and has expanded resources dedicated to finding the missing aircraft.

Beijing on Monday urged the Malaysian government to “step up search efforts.”

“We have a responsibility to demand and urge the Malaysian side to step up search efforts, start an investigation as soon as possible and provide relevant information to China correctly and in a timely manner,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang.

Chinese Weibo users also mocked the Malaysian government’s recruitment of a shaman, who had said, "I think the plane is still in the air or has crashed into the sea.”

Two-thirds of the passengers were from China. Beijing had previously redeployed as many as 10 high-resolution satellites in the hunt for the missing Malaysian plane. The satellites, until today, had only identified three oil slicks.###4346||The big market story of the day? It was a brutal session in China.

Over the weekend, a bunch of bad economic data came out, including an exceptionally weak export number.

That led to a swift market reaction in China.

The Shanghai Composite , which is already having a fairly rough year, lost 2.86%.

Copper tanked 1.5%. Copper tends to be sensitive to Chinese industrial demand and is having a horrible year.

The Chinese Yuan continues to slide, and is now at its highest level since late last year.

Meanwhile, the ripples were felt across Asia, with Hong Kong losing 1.7%, Korea down 1%, Japan off 1%, and Australia off 0.9%.###4347||Bloomberg

China doubled the limit for the yuan’s daily moves against the US dollar, easing controls on the exchange rate as appreciation bets waned amid slower economic growth.

The yuan will, from today, be able to trade as much as 2 percent on either side of a daily central bank reference rate, from 1 percent previously, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its Web site on Saturday.

The band was last widened in April 2012 from 0.5 percent, and before that from 0.3 percent in May 2007.

The move underscores pledges from China’s leaders to make the exchange rate more market-based and promote freer movement of capital in and out of the country for investment purposes.

The central bank said on Saturday it will continue to increase the yuan’s two-way flexibility after last month highlighting an “orderly” broadening of the currency’s trading band among its policy goals this year.

The band widening “strengthens the bank’s signal that the one-way bet on the yuan’s gain is over and we should expect much more yuan-dollar volatility going forward,” Lu Ting (陸挺), head of Greater China economics at Bank of America Corp in Hong Kong, said in an e-mail.

“Further band widening is of little meaning. A much more important and meaningful reform is to change the rule on setting the daily fixing,” Lu added.

The central bank needs to shift to a new market-based system, Lu said. As an intermediate step in improving the fixing, it could peg the yuan to a basket of currencies weighted by the importance of its trading partners, Lu said.

While the central bank will “basically exit” normal foreign-exchange intervention to allow markets a greater role, it will “conduct the necessary adjustment and management” in cases of abnormally large fluctuations, the bank said in a separate statement.

The currency has slid 1.8 percent from a 20-year high of 6.0406 per US dollar reached on Jan. 14, after rising 2.9 percent last year.

The yuan fell as much as 0.86 percent on Feb. 28, the biggest intraday loss in China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices going back to 2007.

The drop was also the largest since China unified official and market exchange rates at the start of 1994. The yuan closed at 6.1502 on Friday.

Recent weakness was driven by the central bank in order to curb one-way appreciation bets before broadening the trading limit, HSBC Holdings Plc strategists led by Paul Mackel wrote in a note on Saturday.

One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, touched an 18-month high of 2.49 percent on Friday.

Non-deliverable forwards due in 12 months completed the biggest weekly drop since November 2011.

Saturday’s announcement follows data signaling an economic slowdown that may make Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s (李克強) expansion target this year of about 7.5 percent harder to reach.

Industrial output had the weakest January-to-February growth since 2009 and fixed-asset investment increased at the slowest pace for the two-month period in 13 years, government reports released on Thursday showed.

GDP rose 7.7 percent last year, the same pace as in 2012, which was the weakest increase since 1999.

Yuan appreciation and capital inflows are unlikely amid the weak economic data, JPMorgan economists led by Zhu Haibin (朱海濱) wrote in a research note.###4348||This will appear next to all of your comments

* Indian rupee hits fresh 7-month high vs dollar (Updates prices, adds text)

By Masayuki Kitano

SINGAPORE, March 11 (Reuters) - Emerging Asian currencies edged higher versus the dollar on Tuesday with sentiment improving as the Chinese yuan stabilised and regional equities held firm.

The Indian rupee hit a fresh seven-month high against the dollar at 60.5925. Traders said moves in local equities were being watched for cues on foreign fund inflows.

The South Korean won edged higher, helped by South Korean exporters’ dollar selling for settlements and a rebound in the Chinese yuan.

Asian currencies were broadly firmer, although the Indonesian rupiah was little changed, lagging slightly behind other regional units. One rupiah trader said foreign banks were spotted selling the dollar versus the rupiah on behalf of their clients.

Asian currencies drew support from “slightly brighter equities” and the Chinese yuan’s mid-point fixing, said a trader for a Malaysian bank in Kuala Lumpur.

The yuan’s mid-point was set at 6.1327 versus the dollar on Tuesday.

The yuan’s mid-point was fixed at a lower level than was set on Monday. But the one-day change was smaller than Monday’s, when the Chinese currency’s mid-point was fixed at a much weaker level than on Friday.

The yuan stood at 6.1350 versus the dollar, up around 0.1 percent on the day.

Emerging Asian currencies closely track the Chinese yuan because of the region’s dependence on China’s economy.

THAI BAHT

One near-term event risk for the baht is an interest rate decision by Thailand’s central bank on Wednesday.

The Bank of Thailand is seen likely to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.00 percent on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll.

As the market seems to have mostly factored in the possibility of a rate cut, the baht might attract some buying if the central bank decides to stand pat, said Teppei Ino, a Singapore-based analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

Still, any reaction to the monetary policy decision will probably be limited, Ino said, adding that a bigger issue is Thailand’s lingering political uncertainty.

“I don’t think it will become that much of a factor either way,” Ino said, referring to Wednesday’s rate decision.

The blizzard of announcements saw the appointment of the Bank’s first woman deputy governor in more than five years with the appointment of Egyptian-born IMF deputy managing director Nemat Shafik, pictured, in the newly created role of Deputy Governor for markets and banking.

She will plot an exit from the Bank’s money-printing programme, improve its market intelligence capabilities and represent the Bank at international bodies including the IMF.

External member Ben Broadbent also becomes Deputy Governor for monetary policy, replacing Charlie Bean who retires in the summer. Broadbent — highly rated by the Treasury where he used to work — has had a meteoric rise since joining the Bank from Goldman Sachs in 2011. Deputy governors earn £260,000 plus pension.

The changes come as Carney looks to break down “silos” between different departments and include more cross-departmental roles, as the Bank takes on new powers to supervise financial institutions as well as controlling inflation. Other senior changes involve chief economist Spencer Dale swapping jobs with the Bank’s executive director for financial stability Andy Haldane; Haldane will now sit on the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee. Anthony Habgood was confirmed as the new chairman of the Bank’s Court, replacing Sir David Lees.

The biggest loser is current director for markets, Paul Fisher, who loses his spot on the MPC to Shafik. Fisher came under heavy fire last week as the Bank was dragged into the foreign exchange fixing scandal, drawing criticism when he said “it isn’t our job to go hunting” for market wrongdoing.

The manoeuvring heralds a huge turnaround on the MPC since Lord King retired as Governor.

BNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said: “It certainly adds a degree of raised uncertainty as to how the debate on the MPC will go from the second half of this year, when most of the changes occur. In Paul Fisher’s departure the MPC is clearly losing a ‘dove’. But in Spencer Dale’s move off the MPC it is also losing a ‘hawk’.”###4353||###4354||Bank of England governor Mark Carney will face a marathon grilling by MPs over Scottish independence, the future path of interest rates and allegations of foreign exchange rate-fixing.

Carney is set to appear tomorrow before the Treasury select committee just days after the Bank suspended an employee over compliance concerns following an internal probe in a marathon three-part session that will see him questioned over the abandonment of his flagship "forward guidance" policy on interest rates as well as Scottish independence.

His deputy Andrew Bailey has already admitted that claims linking the Bank to the burgeoning forex scandal - which regulators say threatens to match the seriousness of Libor rate-rigging - could prove "enormously damaging".

The Bank was dragged into the forex affair - which is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - after a Bloomberg report centring on a meeting between officials and bank traders in 2012.

It was claimed that at the meeting, the traders admitted to the practice of sharing information about customer orders before currency benchmarks are set - an alleged practice at the heart of an ongoing regulatory probe into market manipulation.

They were said to have been told that there was no policy on these communications and that banks should make their own rules.

Bailey stressed during an appearance before MPs last month that the Bank did not condone any market manipulation and that it took the claims "very seriously".

Last week, it said it had found no evidence that its staff had been involved in forex manipulation, but revealed it had suspended a member of staff while it investigated compliance with internal control processes.

The Bank's internal review has so far covered around 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chat room records and more than 40 hours of telephone call recordings.

Regulators worldwide - including the FCA in Britain - are investigating a number of firms and their foreign exchange trading activities as part of a major probe of the £3 trillion a day forex market.

They are looking into whether currency traders shared information about their positions and knowledge of client orders through instant messages to rig the foreign exchange market in their favour.

FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley told MPs earlier this year that allegations surrounding forex trading were "every bit as bad" as the Libor rate-rigging scandal, which has cost banks billions in fines.

Carney's three-part evidence session before the Treasury Select Committee will begin with a section on the Bank's Inflation Report last month.

The publication of the report saw policy makers abandon the forward guidance policy linking interest rates to unemployment after just six months, as the jobless rate had improved much more quickly than previously anticipated.

Carney said at the time that the economic recovery was "neither balanced nor sustainable" and that rates would have to stay well below pre-recession levels of around 5% for the next few years.

Deputy governor Charlie Bean said in his latest speech that this was likely to mean rates being at 2-3% "for some while".

Martin Weale, another member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, has said that they are likely to rise from their current rate of 0.5% - where they have been since 2009 - in spring next year.

The evidence session will also address the "economics of currency unions" amid debate over the possible implications of a Scottish vote for independence.

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK.

First Minister Alex Salmond's Scottish Government wants to create a "sterling zone" with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to how this is done in the eurozone.

"Any arrangement to retain sterling in an independent Scotland would need to be negotiated between the Westminster and Scottish parliaments," he said. "The Bank of England would implement whatever monetary arrangements were put in place."

Carney's major appearance comes after the Huffington Post UK revealed that the governor had urged the chancellor to consider drafting some women onto the Bank of England's nine-man Monetary Policy Committee.###4355||Candy Crush is a maddeningly addictive game on which people are willing to spend a buck or more to lengthen their vividly-colored screen time. But potential investors to King.com's forthcoming IPO should note it's also a game that brought in roughly three quarters of King.com’s revenue in the fourth quarter, and that there may be a cost to relying so heavily on a digital golden goose, no matter how hooked its users or how much King values itself to be -- a remarkable $7.6 billion .

The chart above shows that Candy Crush has recently been sliding in the ranks of downloaded apps on both Apple ’s App Store (above) and Google Play (below). Having been firmly in the top 10 for much of July and all of August 2013, the game eventually dropped into the teens and even 20th position in December 2013, according to app analytics company App Annie.

That slide mirrors a fall in revenue for Candy Crush’s maker, King Digital Entertainment, and shows just how closely correlated the company's finances are to one game. In the last three months of 2013, King's sales slipped to $632 million from $648 million in the previous quarter, while net profit also fell to $269 million from $290 million.

King did not wish to comment for this story, but the company has been open about the investment risks in its SEC filing today, noting that “a small number of games currently generate a substantial majority of our revenue,” (though “one game” might have been more accurate). The company said that in the future it expects Candy Crush to represent a smaller percentage of gross bookings from mobile as it expands into other games:

“If the gross bookings of our top games, including Candy Crush Saga are lower than anticipated and we are unable to broaden our portfolio of games or increase gross bookings from those games, we will not be able to maintain or grow our revenue and our financial results could be adversely affected.”

King has been producing casual games for a decade and been profitable since 2005, so potential investors are of course also betting on the company's clever strategies for sniffing out and promoting the next blockbuster hit that will dominate app rankings.

But history tells us even the most effective strategies which stretch the boundaries of exploitative game mechanics can’t guarantee future blockbusters that replicate what Candy Crush has achieved till now. Just ask Zynga, maker of the blockbuster social game Farmville, whose shares have fallen 40% since its December 2011 IPO. Zynga’s shares debuted at $11 but have been hovering around the $3-5 mark for almost two years.

Rovio, the maker of blockbuster mobile game Angry Birds, has chosen not to go public, though when I visited the company’s Espoo, Finland-based offices in June 2011, management then were tentatively excited about a future IPO. Rovio back then had just seen its annual revenue jump by 300% and it was dominating the top ten charts globally. Since then however, Angry Birds has fallen into the mid-30s in rankings according to App Annie.

"We don't want to estimate ourselves in bubblelicious figures," Rovio’s vice president Ville Heijari eloquently said then, adding that Rovio didn’t want to “rush” towards an IPO. That may have been wise in hindsight. Rovio has yet to release a game with the same impact of Angry Birds, though it’s had relative success in milking the game’s brand and characters with merchandising deals.

It's worth noting that King may manage to counterbalance Candy Crush’s eventual disappearance from our screens with other, addictive games. Its other colorful offering, Farm Heroes, seems to have the most potential. According to the company’s filing it had racked up 20 million daily active users in February, up rapidly from 8 million in December 2013.

But it's still no Candy Crush, which had 93 million users in December 2013.###4356||Empty###4357||Colorado's former top marijuana enforcement official has been hired by a Denver-based marijuana consulting business.

-- Noelle Crombie###4358||REUTERS: Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10% in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," the company said.

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5% organic growth and higher than 30% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5% revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5% decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company's sales team.

Symantec had been reorganising its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software-maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list," Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

Rossiya and Kovalchuk were also put on the U.S. sanctions list Thursday.

Ottawa also imposed economic sanctions against the bank itself "for its support of Russian officials who bear responsibility for the crisis."

Mr. Harper is currently traveling to Ukraine, where he is meeting officials before heading to the Netherlands and Germany.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.

The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker's disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.

"Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues ... Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress," Holder told a news conference.

Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, "we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust," said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. "In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first."

Toyota said it had "made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totalling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totalling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.###4369||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — GameStop Corp. was a notable loser in the S&P 500 on Tuesday amid concerns that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. may threaten its hold on the used videogame market while Microsoft Corp. rose on a price target hike.

GameStop GME, -2.49% shares dropped 3.1%. The move came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.35% said it would allow customers to hand in used videogames in exchange for gift cards, which can be used in its retail stores or online. The change in policy from Wal-Mart Stores could eat away at GameStop’s dominance of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S. Wal-Mart shares are up marginally.

Microsoft MSFT, +0.41% shares rose 4.3%. Analysts at Barclays hiked the stock’s price target to $44 from $43. “Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365. It can drive better earnings growth as it transitions its ubiquitous on-premise install bases (Office and Windows Server) to its cloud platforms,” analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a report. Barclays rates the stock at overweight.

Decliners

Bloomberg GameStop shares are sliding.

NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +1.14% shares fell 3.1%. The exchange operator will host an investor’s day on March 27. Analysts from Jefferies who recently met with Nasdaq executives said the management is upbeat about Nasdaq OMX NLX, its derivatives platform.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. KORS, -3.45% slid 2.2%. Analysts at Barclays initiated coverage of the U.S. luxury sector with a positive industry outlook but Michael Kors was issued an underweight rating.

Gainers

Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ, +0.17% shares added 3.7%. The stock’s rating was raised to overweight from equalweight and its price target hiked to $38 versus $33 at Barclays on Tuesday.

SanDisk Corp. US:SNDK shares gained 4.4%. The stock will be added to the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index on March 24. The index is composed of 100 tech and telecommunications companies that regularly pay a dividend.

Shares of United States Steel Corp. X, -0.90% rose 5.3%. Analysts at Nomura lowered U.S. Steel’s first-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to 35 cents from 40 cents. The stock is rated a buy with a target price of $32. The stock is down 14% year to date.

Tickers to Watch

TSLA: Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, -2.31% rose 2.3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the stock’s six-month price target to $200, which is still below its current trading level of $239.

MSG: Madison Square Garden Co. MSG, +0.56% shares are up 0.8%. The entertainment company said Tuesday that it named Phil Jackson, one of the successful coaches in the NBA history, as president of the New York Knicks. Jackson won two championships as a player with the Knicks in 1970 and 1973. He also coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles and the Los Angeles Lakers to five titles.

HTZ: Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, +1.56% shares edged up 0.1%. The company said Tuesday it received board approval to proceed with a spinoff of its equipment-rental business that is expected to close by early next year. The new company will be called HERC, the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, while Hertz will retain the rental-car businesses. Hertz said it will receive about $2.5 billion in proceeds from the spinoff that will be used to pay down debt and fund a new $1 billion stock buyback program.

At the same time, Hertz said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed as revenue rose to $2.56 billion, with its adjusted per-share earnings coming in at 26 cents. But results fell short of analyst expectations compiled by FactSet.

THC: Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, -2.17% rose 1.6%. Analysts at Mizuho said they would be buyers of hospital stocks like Tenet due to the sector’s recent weakness on changes related to individual mandate exemption rules and earnings. “We do not think either issue will have a meaningful negative impact on our EPS estimates for the hospital group,” the analysts said in a note. Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, -0.70% climbed 3.4% and HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -1.83% advanced 2.2%.

The financing will bring in several hundred million dollars, though the final amount hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal remains in flux. The San Francisco-based company, backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was valued at US$2.5 billion in 2012.

At US$10 billion, Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, which includes Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It would also be worth more than twice as much as publicly traded vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc.

A slew of technology startups have lately raised huge rounds of financing at increasing valuations, as corporate investors, hedge funds and mutual funds seek stakes in companies before they go public. Messaging application TangoMe Inc. today raised US$280 million from investors led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in a deal that values the startup at more than US$1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this week, Cloudera Inc. said it raised US$160 million, with more set to come from investors including Intel Corp., people with knowledge of the situation said.

Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb lets users rent out a couch, bedroom or house and makes money by charging a fee for each transaction. The company has listings in more than 34,000 cities, according to its website.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Airbnb’s financing. An Airbnb representative didn’t immediately have a comment. Adam Levine, TPG’s global head of public affairs, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.

The shares are up more than 7 percent on Frankfurt's Xetra.

For full-year 2013, group profit before tax was 7.91 billion euros and the company had delivered 1,963,798 units to customers, up 6.4 percent from 2012, with sales volume growth on nearly all continents.

At the company's Annual Accounts Press Conference, Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG stated, "We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles."

The firm said the pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

According to the company, its Automotive division would again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10 percent, despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies. In 2013, segment EBIT margin was 9.4 percent.

BMW forecast a slight increase in Motorcycles segment sales due to contribution expected from new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs. For 2013, the number of BMW motorcycles delivered to customers were 115,215 units, an increase of 8.3 percent.

In 2014, the Financial Services segment is likely to also remain on growth course, the company said.

BMW stated that its current year forecasts are based on assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

Last week, BMW Group reported a higher fourth-quarter profit on improved volumes. The company forecast further sales volume growth in 2014, and said its board will propose a higher dividend.

Business News###4373||Empty###4374||NEW YORK/ZURICH: Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay $885 million to resolve claims by a U.S. regulator that the Swiss bank misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.

The settlement announced on Friday would resolve claims in two lawsuits filed in New York by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies.

It is the ninth settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011, when it filed 18 lawsuits over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

The accord resolves claims pending in New York federal court against Credit Suisse over $16.6 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and ends what the Swiss bank called the largest mortgage-related investor litigation it still faced.

Credit Suisse will pay $234 million to Fannie Mae and $651 million to Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.

So far, the FHFA has recovered more than $10.1 billion from banks over similar securities.

This includes nearly $9.8 billion in settlements of litigation with such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The FHFA also reached a separate $335.2 million accord with Wells Fargo & Co, which it did not formally sue.

Many of the settlements were reached after a series of series of court rulings that went against the banks.

Lawsuits remain pending against several other banks, including Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

Credit Suisse said on Friday it will reduce previously reported fourth-quarter and 2013 results by 275 million Swiss francs ($311.17 million) after taxes for the settlement, resulting in a fourth-quarter net loss of 8 million Swiss francs.

While Credit Suisse said the settlement resolves the biggest mortgage case it faced, the bank still must deal with other mortgage cases in the United States, including ones by the National Credit Union Administration and attorneys general in New York and New Jersey.

Credit Suisse is also one of 14 Swiss banks targeted by U.S. prosecutors for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank has said it is trying to settle that matter.

Last month, the Zurich-based bank agreed to pay $196.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it provided unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients.

The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06200.###4375||WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than five years after the financial crisis struck, the biggest U.S. banks are better able to withstand a severe recession than at any time since the meltdown, the Federal Reserve has determined.

Results of the Fed's annual "stress tests" showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks' financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year's tests.

"The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago," said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The banks' stronger positions should enable them to pursue business plans, pay dividends to shareholders, raise capital from investors and expand services to customers, said Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed's stress tests' "severely adverse" scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That's down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year's tests — even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks' progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.

The 30 banks were also tested on how well they would withstand severe downturns in Europe and in Asian countries like China and Japan.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Nearly all U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in assets were in the group of 30 that were tested. Together they account for some $13.5 trillion in assets — about 80 percent of U.S. banks' total amount. Twelve of the 30 banks were added to the testing roster for the first time this year.

Most of the 30 banks tested, along with hundreds of others, received federal bailouts during the financial crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.

Zions, the only bank to fall short this year, is based in Salt Lake City. It slid to a loss in the fourth quarter as it booked hefty charges related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items.

Zions said in a statement that its performance on the stress tests was worse than it expected mostly due to significantly higher commercial real estate losses, significantly greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue. The bank said that it will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Ally said it was pleased that the test results "recognized the substantial transformation that the company has undergone since last year."

The Fed concluded last March that Wall Street powerhouses JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needed better plans for coping with a severe downturn and gave the banks until September to revise them. The two banks were allowed to increase their dividends and buy back their stock on condition they submitted revised capital plans that satisfied the Fed.

At the same time, the Fed approved requests outright from 14 of the 18 banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

But the Fed forbade Ally and BB&T Corp. from making any dividend increases and share buybacks they may have been seeking.

Next Wednesday, the Fed will announce whether it has approved each bank's request, if one has been made, to raise dividends for shareholders. Its decisions will be based on how each bank would fare in a severe recession if it increased its payout.

Raising dividends costs money. The government doesn't want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.

The other banks tested were: American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Comerica Inc., Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp, M&T Bank Corp., Northern Trust Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., Santander Holdings USA Inc., State Street Corp., U.S. Bancorp and UnionBanCal Corp.

EUR/JPY slid to a daily low of 141.03 at 08:24 GMT, after which the pair consolidated at 141.10, losing 0.4% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 140.90, while resistance was to be met at March 13th high, 143.38.

Yen’s demand was supported after it became clear that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that he is ready to sign an accession treaty with Ukraine’s breakaway region of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, regardless of the imposed sanctions by the United States and the European Union.

The yen has advanced 1.1% in the past week amid escalating tension between the West and Russia, being the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. At the same time, the euro was little changed.

Meanwhile, the gauge of economic sentiment for Germany, the largest economy in the euro zone, probably slowed down to a reading of 51.8 in March, according to the median estimate by experts. Last month the index came in at a value of 55.7. The official results from the monthly survey by the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung) are to be announced at 10:00 GMT today.

Yesterday, demand for the 18-nation common currency was pressured after the annualized rate of consumer inflation in the single currency zone was reported to have weakened in February, increasing bets the European Central Bank will have to introduce new measures in order to spur economic growth.

The annualized HICP came in at 0.7% last month, a level last seen during October 2013, which was still far below central bank’s inflation objective of 2%, that provides price stability. Experts had anticipated that the annual inflation rate will remain steady at 0.8% in February.

Elsewhere, EUR/CHF slipped to a daily low at 1.2150 at 7:50 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.2153, down a mere 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 17th low, 1.2133, while resistance was to be encountered at March 13th high, 1.2168.###4380||Is President Barack Obama trying to boost revenues for Russian-made credit cards? In his latest round of sanctions, he's banned Visa and MasterCard from operating in Russia, which could lure customers over to Putin-backed credit cards.

According to the Moscow Times, "Visa and MasterCard have stopped, without notification, providing services for payment transactions for clients at Russia's Bank Rossiya, the sanctions-hit bank said on Friday, Reuters reported."

Obama is punishing US-based credit card companies for allegedly supporting Crimea's annexation to Russia.

As reported by the Moscow Times, "The United States Treasury Department on Thursday published an updated list of individuals it was sanctioning for their involvement with Russia's absorption of Crimea or their role as part of President Vladimir Putin's "inner circle." It also stated that Bank Rossiya was on the list, "because it is controlled by, has acted for or on behalf of, or has provided material or other support to, senior Russian government officials."

Visa and MasterCard have been deemed as allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin and therefore, the global community must stand up and cut their Visa and MasterCards. The world welcomes their imminent demise.

The state's unemployment numbers for January will be released on Monday. The rate in the month of December was 6.2 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.



Payroll provider ADP reported that the state added 11,610 private sector jobs in January and 10,840 additional jobs during the month of February. ADP's survey is separate from the one that is conducted by government agencies.



Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.



But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

The escort change was for administrative reasons: The Stout is assigned to the U.S. European Command area, and the Elrod is assigned to U.S. Africa Command, Warren said.

About 25 members of the Stout's crew who had been aboard the Morning Glory to provide security, navigation and communications assistance have been replaced by about 34 sailors from the Elrod, according to Warren. The Elrod and Morning Glory are expected to reach international waters just outside Libya this weekend, where the Morning Glory will be turned over to Libyan authorities, Warren said.

The Morning Glory, hijacked from the port of As-Sidra, is carrying oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. Libya and Cyprus had requested assistance from the U.S. government in regaining control of the ship. The SEALS embarked from the USS Roosevelt, which is deployed in the Mediterranean as part of the George H.W. Bush carrier strike group.

No one was hurt in the SEAL operation, Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a news release earlier this week.

The company is set to pay more than $1bn (£602m, €718m) to the department in order to cap its four-year investigation, according to media reports. The fine is one of the largest ever imposed on an auto maker.

The settlement is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement, allowing Toyota to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. The settlement is not final and could still fall apart, according to WSJ.

A spokeswoman for Toyota told the newspaper that the company has been addressing many issues raised in the investigation.

"Toyota has cooperated with the US attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said.

"During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organisation, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Unintended Acceleration

Toyota had to recall millions of vehicles due to unintended acceleration in the late 2000s. The problem resulted in the death of a number of people in the US.

While the company recalled the problematic vehicles promptly, the US Justice Department found Toyota had made misleading statements about safety problems to the government and to the public. The investigation was led by the office of Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara.

The auto maker has been fined four times for a total of $66.2m by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for failing to report safety defects to the government. Three of those fines were related to issues concerning unwanted acceleration.

Toyota has never admitted wrongdoing in any of the law suits brought against it involving unintended acceleration.

The agreement with Toyota comes as the justice department is looking into a safety issue at General Motors.

GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. There were allegations that GM engineers knew about the issue years ago but the automaker was reluctant to recall vehicles until last month.###4389||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified March 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.###4390||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, said a lot of ipeople bought Symantec because it had a new CEO and was involved in online security. "How can you miss?" was the thinking, he said.

However, Symantec didn't "change with the times" and was focusing on personal computers rather than mobile.

Pointing to FireEye (FEYE), Cramer said that a stock can do very well in this industry when it delivers but when it offered 14 million shares in a secondary offering, FireEye shares suffered.

Cramer admitted he "fears" that when the insiders in Symantec start selling their shares, the stock will suffer. He also thinks this will happen to any company going public now.

"Insider selling is what wrecked 2000," Cramer concluded, and it can wreck these companies, too.

The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form a store credit.

The world's largest retailer began offering the feature, called "Savings Catcher," on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Citibank launched a similar program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if Citibank finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.###4395||SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hovered near a three-week peak against a basket of major currencies early on Friday, but could struggle to extend gains as investors awaited more clarity on the Federal Reserve’s policy path.

Fed officials including Richard Fisher, James Bullard and Narayana Kocherlakota are all due to speak later on Friday, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen surprised markets mid-week by suggesting the possibility of raising interest rates early next year.

U.S. yields have all moved higher as markets brought forward the risk of a Fed rate hike by April. The dollar index last traded at 80.192 .DXY, not far from the high of 80.354, a level not seen since late February.

“A heavy Fed speaker calendar Friday will be carefully parsed for any effort to roll back this week’s shift forward in tightening expectations,” analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients.

However, they noted that most of the Fed speakers are generally on the hawkish end of the spectrum.

“In any event, we would expect the Fed to struggle to fully reverse the move in rates...unless data begins to significantly disappoint expectations once again.”

U.S. data on Thursday was mixed but a rebound in factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region held out hope the economy might be regaining strength after being hobbled by severe weather.

Against the yen, the euro eased to 141.07 yen, back near the lower-end of this week’s 140.46-141.97 range.

The U.S. dollar struggled to make further gains on the Japanese currency after topping out at 102.69 on Wednesday. It last stood at 102.39.

The greenback also lost steam against the Canadian and Australian dollars. It last traded at C$1.1237 after reaching a 4-1/2 year high of C$1.1279, while the Aussie popped back above 90 U.S. cents from a low of $0.8995.

(WMT) said that customers will be able to trade in their video games starting Wednesday, March 26 and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online.

The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

"Gaming continues to be an important for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The company asked customers to bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department. It said that associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks. The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept. The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam's Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com.

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary, the company said.

Walmart stated that customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com, later this year. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

In a related report by The Inquisitr, a Texas principal tried banning speaking Spanish on campus only to lose her job over the incident after an outcry from Hispanics.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the one who threatened the Turkey Twitter ban. The government censored the web domain for all internet users in the country, but that did not last very long at all. The Twitter company itself sent out messages reminding everyone how to use cell phone-based SMS text messaging to access Twitter. They also gave tips on alternative computer settings that could bypass Turkey’s blocks, which simply use redirects of the domain name so using an outside DNS server can help. Other private companies offered Twitter access in Turkey via Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and internet proxies services.

Philip Howard, head of the Digital Activism Research Project, claims that Turkey’s Twitter ban only caused the service to become more popular within the country:

“Trying to ban Twitter has backfired. It’s drawn the world’s attention to the country’s increasingly tough censorship and surveillance strategy. News of the ban seems to have driven more Turks to try Twitter out for the first time, breaking national records for Twitter use. Tip sheets for getting around the ban spread like wildfire.”

Instead of deterring people, the Turkey Twitter ban actually emboldened people and the number of Tweets out of Turkey increased to record levels. It’s claimed by some that practically the only people who are not using Twitter in Turkey now are pro-government supporters. It’s estimated by some survey that almost 15 percent of the Turkish population is now using Twitter.

But why was Turkey’s Twitter ban implemented in the first place? Some reports claim Prime Minister Erdogan targeted the social media platform because Turkish users were using it to spread news and videos showcasing the corruption of the Turkish government.

David Kramer, president of the pro-democracy group Freedom House, claims that a truly democratic nation should not be afraid of Twitter:

“The decision to block Twitter, a leading medium of communication in Turkey, is quite a dramatic step for a government that claims to be democratic. It is a bold attempt to stop news of government corruption from getting out in the run-up to local elections. The government should immediately reopen Twitter and recognize that free, unhindered space for debate is essential in Turkey, as it is anywhere else.”

Turkey’s Twitter ban is not the first time they’ve attempted internet censorship. The government tried the same thing with YouTube only to have technically savvy Turkish people bypass their efforts. Twitter is also banned in China but many Chinese still use the social media service regardless of their government’s censorship.###4402||Malaysia’s police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the simulator, taken from the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, showed its data log had been cleared on Feb. 3, more than a month before the airliner, carrying 239 people, disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian to Beijing.

“The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,” he told a news conference.

No wreckage has been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8, less than an hour after taking off.

Malaysia has now made available to the FBI electronic data generated by both pilots of Flight MH370, including data from a hard drive attached to the captain’s flight simulator, and from electronic media used by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters.

The official said he could not confirm that some data had been wiped from the simulator and stressed that there was no guarantee the FBI analysis would turn up any fresh clues.

U.S. investigators had become increasingly frustrated in recent days that Malaysian authorities had not asked them for more help.

The FBI has extensive experience investigating airplane crashes, including those of TWA 800 and EgyptAir 990 off the U.S. East Coast in the 1990s and Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

In the case of EgyptAir 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot, while in the case of Pan Am 103, the agency worked with British and U.S. intelligence to build a case against the government of Libya.

In Kuala Lumpur, at the headquarters of a search operation that has so far turned up few leads, Chinese relatives’ anger over sparse information on the fate of their relatives sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday.

Malaysia’s transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency.

“They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don’t know how long we have to wait,” cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum.

Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish.

“Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,” he said in a statement.

Dwindling hopes

Prospects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north.

“Our top priority is being given to that area,” Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.

It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 230,000 square miles roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.

The unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER had focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia’s Sumatra island to west of Australia.

“The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,” said a source close to the investigation.

That view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.

Some sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could stall due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took.

Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.

“These are basically spy planes; that’s what they were designed for,” said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters.

Hishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance.

“The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,” he told the news conference, held in aKuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations.

Deliberately diverted

Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.

If the plane did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.

Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital data links: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.

U.S. agencies have looked for evidence that anyone other than the pilots knew how disable ACARS but have found nothing.###4403||Why did this happen?

By Abhirup Roy

March 21 (Reuters) - Symantec Corp’s shares fell as much as 14 percent on Friday, a day after the security software maker fired its chief executive, raising concerns about its turnaround efforts.

At least five brokerages downgraded the stock, which has fallen nearly 17 percent in the past six months as the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, struggles with falling PC sales and a lackluster show on smartphone and tablets.

Steve Bennett, who took over as CEO in July 2012, had launched a strategic review of the business after replacing company veteran Enrique Salem, who was fired after three years on the job.

Since Bennett took over, the company’s shares had gained more than 40 percent to Thursday’s close.

“The first year was terrific, the last six months have been terrible,” MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez said.

“I think he got success with the low hanging fruit initially, but when he started to tackle the difficult challenge of changing the sales culture and reorganizing the sales organization ... that’s when the cookie crumbled,” Hernandez said.

Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz said morale had improved under Bennett.

Schwartz said Bennett’s exit, which follows several other departures over the past seven months, could hurt morale in Symantec.

He downgraded the company’s stock to “hold” from “buy” and cut his price target to $22 from $29. The company’s shares were down 12.7 percent at $18.25 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

Symantec’s chief financial officer of seven years, James Beer, resigned last September, while its president of products and services quit in November.

Chairman Daniel Schulman said the company was looking for a leader who would drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.

However, MKM’s Hernandez said it would be challenging for Symantec to get a new CEO as the market for talent had become competitive.

Analysts say Symantec has failed to evolve its antivirus and security products fast enough and keep pace with network security software makers such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks.

Network security software products are in demand as they analyse business networks and try to preempt cyber attacks, while antivirus software removes threats after computers have already been infected.

Research firm Gartner said in 2012 that the market for security software was expected to grow about 30 percent to $87 billion by 2016. (r.reuters.com/dyx77v)

Symantec has also struggled to gain a foothold in the fast growing mobile security software market, which is dominated by companies such as Lookout Inc, NQ Mobile Inc, Avast Software and Kaspersky.

Cowen and Co analyst Gregg Moskowitz said the departure of a cost-conscious CEO, combined with Symantec’s recent mis-execution and absence of continuity at the top, had reduced his confidence in the company’s ability to improve long-term operating margins.

Moskowitz downgraded the stock to “market perform” from “outperform.”

Mountain View, California-based Symantec appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO on Thursday.

Bennett may get as much as $18.5 million in severance payment, based on his employment agreement. His total compensation was $13 million for the fiscal year ended March 2013.

Problems for Symantec started in 2005 after it bought storage software maker Veritas in a $13.5 billion deal. Since then, Symantec has repeatedly disappointed Wall Street with weak numbers, mainly due to falling PC sales.

Immediately following Turkey’s ban, Twitter issued an SMS workaround. Then, “#TwitterisblockedinTurkey” became a globally trending topic on Twitter. Into the night, usage of Google’s free DNS service exploded to circumvent the blockage of Twitter’s domain. Now, social media analysis firms Brandwatch and We Are Social report that Turkish tweets last night and this morning are up by a massive 138 percent.

The following graph, provided by Brandwatch, shows the rise in tweets from 2 A.M. to 12 P.M. (Turkish CET).

Turkish users collectively tweeted 2.5 million times since the ban went into effect, potentially “setting new records for Twitter use in the country,” according to a different study reported by the Guardian.

Fanning the flames, usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) in Turkey appears to be up significantly. ZenMate, for example — a security and privacy extension for Google Chrome — reports it saw “25,000 visitors from Turkey to the Chrome store in the last 12 hours.” Similarly, VPN provider Hotspot Shield saw an uptick in usage on iOS, and is now the top Android app in the Google Play store in Turkey.

Studies such as the above serve only as rough guidelines and are limited by sample size. Collectively, however, the reports make for strong evidence that Erdogan has failed to enact an effective country-wide ban on Twitter.

Asian markets were down across the board today (March 20th) on the back of the latest suggestion interest rates could soon be increased in the US.

After chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen stated that rates might be put up by the body next year, markets such as the Nikkei were down.

Ms Yellen took over as chair of the Fed towards the end of last year, replacing Ben Bernanke in the role. She was the preferred candidate of US president Barack Obama to take the leadership of the body.

The Fed has continued to wind down its bond-buying programme and Ms Yellen suggested interest rates could be increased from zero per cent six months after that scheme has come to an end.

Markets down

These comments from the Fed's chair hurt Asian markets, with the Nikkei down by 1.65 per cent over the course of the session following her press conference. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite were also down on the back of Ms Yellen's statement, with each suffering from a loss of more than one per cent.

Peter Redward, of Redward Associates, suggested that the impact of an increase to US interest rates is not going to be the same in Asia as it will be in some of the world's emerging markets.

"We're going to see the type of reaction we've seen in other emerging markets which means interest rates are probably going to climb as well," he told the BBC, suggesting the first Asian country to increase interest rates could be the Philippines.

Mr Redward added: "The issue for Asia is that the US isn't the locomotive for this region that it once was. The rise of China and the relative decline of the US means that it just isn't going to pull the region forward like it has in the past."

A rise in US interest rates could put pressure on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to increase the UK's base rate, which has stood at a record low of 0.5 per cent for the last five years.

KUALA LUMPUR/PERTH - Reuters

French satellite images show ‘floating debris’ in the southern Indian Ocean. AFP photo

New French satellite images show possible debris from a missing Malaysian airliner deep in the southern Indian Ocean, Malaysia said March 23, adding to growing signs that the plane may have gone down in remote seas off Australia.The latest lead came as the international search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace of the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board.“This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor,” the Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement. “Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination center.”Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said there was “increasing hope” of a breakthrough in the hunt for the plane on the strength of Chinese and Australian satellite images of possible large debris in the southern search area.The French Foreign Ministry said radar echoes from a satellite put the new debris finding about 2,300 km from Perth, without giving a direction or a date.The debris in the Australian image was about 2,500 km southwest of Perth and the Chinese sighting, captured two days later, was around 120 km “south by west” of that.An international force resumed its search efforts March 23, zeroing in on two areas around where the sightings were made in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris, including a wooden pallet, spotted by a search plane on March 22.China said the object it had seen on the satellite image was 22 meters long and 13 meters wide, floating in some of the most inhospitable sea territory on Earth.It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same as those detected by Australia, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, said a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search.###4423||The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which was grounded for more than three months last year after its batteries overheated, is soundly designed and safe to fly, a joint review by the plane maker and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said.

The review, which was initiated by the FAA after a battery fire aboard a 787 in Boston in January 2013, encompassed the entire plane, not specifically the battery issue.

It made seven recommendations for further improvements in Boeing processes and the agency's oversight, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said.

The Boston fire and another battery incident in Japan several days later prompted regulators to ground the plane for three-and-a-half months last year. The plane has also suffered a series of mishaps with brakes, fuel lines, electrical panels, hydraulics and other systems.

Boeing redesigned the battery, charger and containment system to ensure battery fires would not put the plane at risk, and the Dreamliner was returned to service. The cause of the battery problems has not been determined and is the subject of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation.###4424||Why did this happen?

The Chancellor will say that the current coin, which has been in circulation for 30 years, is no longer suitable for use because it has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

The new 12-sided coin will be as secure as modern banknotes and will save taxpayers’ money by cutting down on millions of pounds worth of fraud.

“After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” the Chancellor is expected to tell MPs.

The Royal Mint estimates that about 45m £1 coins in circulation are now forgeries.

The Government expects the new coin to be introduced in 2017.

As with all British coins, the Queen’s effigy will be on the “heads side”. However, there will now be a public competition to decide the design for the “tails” side of the coin.

The Treasury said: “With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

“We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

A source said that the new coin, which will be roughly the same size as the current £1, will still fit in supermarket trolleys, parking meters and vending machines.

The threepenny bit was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. It replaced the old silver threepence, known as a "Joey".

It was particularly popular during the Second World War, when its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during blackouts.

By the time of decimalisation 1.2bn of the coins had been issued for circulation.

A Bank of England spokesman said: “The Bank welcomes [the] news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”

Kelvin Reynolds, director of policy and public affairs at the British Parking Association, said: “Parking operators have long expressed concerns about a rise in counterfeit £1 coins and the inconvenience this causes to motorists when coins are rejected by parking payment machines and the losses incurred as a result.”

Mt. Gox lost around 850,000 Bitcoins belonging to their customers which were worth around $400 million, and now the company has found 200,000 Bitcoins in an old wallet.

“On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC,” the statement said.

It added that it moved the 200,000 bitcoins from online to offline wallets on March 14-15 “for security reasons.” “These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels,” it noted.

Hopefully this will mean that people who lost money which will held in Bitcoin through Mt. Gox will get at least some of their money back, although nothing has been confirmed as yet.

By Vestnik Kavkaza



The Russian ruble will be officially launched in the territory of Crimea on March 24th. At the moment the ruble exchange rate is growing in Crimean exchange offices. In Russia the ruble is strengthening in the context of reduction of geopolitical risks.



However, yesterday the USA decided to extend the list of Russian officials against whom strict sanctions are launched. 20 people have been included on the list, including the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, his deputy Alexei Gromov, the State Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin, the leader of A Just Russia Sergei Mironov, businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, businessman Yuri Kovalchuk, the owner of Volga Group Gennady Timchenko and the head of Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin. The US President stated that sanctions were being launched against “organizations which provide material support to the Russian government”, i.e. the bank ‘Rossiya’. Barack Obama also signed an order on possible sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy. Whether the sanctions will affect ordinary citizens of Russia is not clear.



Oleg Kazakovtsev, a member of the Federation Council Committee on Budgets and Financial Markets, says that people are only interested in one type of question: “If I have certain savings, will these savings remain? What should I do with them? How will I get my salary? Will the Central Bank fight inflation? These questions are major. People are trying to protect what they have saved. If we look at the market today as a whole, we'll see that there are very few mechanisms with which people can temporarily invest their savings: 80% are accounted for in bank deposits, some of them are accounted for in currencies, but people have generally taken the process of de-dollarization - in 1998 as well as in 2013 - rather calmly. There is another mechanism - through buying property, the only given document is a certificate of ownership and those who are able to still spend their money on real estate. The stock market for the majority is in fact unavailable. We have about 1 million citizens who own shares or are somehow involved in it. In comparison, in America more than 50 million people purchase shares, invest, try to earn something and so on,” Kazakovtsev says.



He thinks it is necessary for the Central Bank to adopt a more flexible policy. “Unfortunately, the policy carried out by the CB of revoking licenses is a relevant measure, but nevertheless every week licenses of regional banks are suspended. This creates an additional negative reaction among depositors. Not all the information reaches people. This all has its impact, and people are trying to purchase foreign currency. There is speculative demand. In 1998, for example, a threshold was introduced for commercial banks - 15%, that is, the addition to the currency price could not be higher than 15%. Now, when people come to the exchange office, they find out that either there is no currency or that some banks are trying to raise the price. As a result, the difference between the rate of the CB and the sale price in exchange offices is quite significant, which causes unexpected interest. I believe that today the Central Bank conducts audits and has resources. The issue is that, if there are doubts, let's make formal requests.”

9f1d1844-48f4-443e-baa1-607661570f4d 9f1d1844-48f4-443e-baa1-607661570f4d Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Wal-Mart will soon accept video game trade-ins 1 / 1 Back to Gallery

NEW YORK >> Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The worlds largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sams Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

Gaming continues to be an important business for us and were actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity, said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.###4436||Exclusive Free E-Book

George Osborne will announce a new design for the £1 coin in today’s Budget. The new 12 sided coin, modelled on the old threepenny bit, will be introduced in 2017.

The Chancellor will say that the current coin, which has been in circulation for thirty years, has become susceptible to forgery, and the Royal Mint estimates that £45m worth of forged £1 coins are in circulation today.

The new coin will be the most secure coin in the world – as secure as modern bank notes – and will save taxpayers’ money from being used to combat fraud.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"we are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Three-penny bit".

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"we're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (ISIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, Queen Elizabeth's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman said: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency." National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

If the debris spotted by satellites—some 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth—is conclusively linked to the plane, it would suggest the Beijing-bound flight flew for hours in the opposite direction of its intended destination.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority

Satellite photos released by the Australian government show two indistinguishable objects. Here’s one:

The area cited is roughly 6,000 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, near the limits of the distance the Boeing 777 could have flown. It’s an extremely remote stretch of ocean—situated between Australia, Antarctica, and Africa—which roughly corresponds to the southern track of the plane’s possible route, as suggested by satellite data transmitted by its engines:

In their full statement, the Australians were careful to say that the debris might not be from the plane, and that visibility in the area was poor. One of the pieces of debris was 24 meters (78 feet) long.

Four aircraft and a merchant ship are headed to the area, as well as an Australian Navy vessel that is several days away.

US officials told CNN a week ago that there was a “significant likelihood” that the plane was on the bottom of the Indian Ocean, citing information that Malaysia shared with the US.

Australia was tasked with searching the southern route that the plane might have taken—an area that covered 600,000 square kilometers of ocean, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which led the search.

On March 19, the authority released a map of a more specific area it was searching:

It also released more specific information on the flight path the plane may have taken, based on information from the US transportation officials, which helped determine the area of interest:

John Young, the head of the emergency response team at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said during a press conference: “We will continue this until we locate these objects or are convinced we cannot find them.” The AMSA “continues to hold grave concerns for the passengers and crew on board.”###4443||Asia's markets were mixed in edgy trade after Russia ratcheted up tensions in Eastern Europe by formally absorbing Crimea from Ukraine.

Investors are also awaiting the end of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, hoping for some guidance from its new head Janet Yellen on her plans for interest rates.

Tokyo rose 0.36 per cent, or 51.25 points, to end at 14,462.52 and Sydney added 0.21 per cent, or 11.0 points, to 5,355.6.

But Seoul lost 0.13 per cent, or 2.53 points, to close at 1,937.68 and Shanghai finished 0.17 per cent lower, giving up 3.46 points to 2,021.73.

Hong Kong ended virtually flat, edging down 14.81 points to 21,568.69.

President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty taking Crimea into Russia's fold following a weekend referendum which Western leaders slammed as illegal.

The move comes less than three weeks after Russian troops seized control of the strategic peninsula in response to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Moscow government.

Kiev's new leaders warned the showdown had entered a "military stage" after soldiers were killed on both sides following a shootout in Crimea.

Despite the continuing crisis in Europe, traders are focused on the Fed's two-day meeting which ends later on Wednesday.

On Wall Street on Tuesday the Dow rose 0.55 per cent, the S&P 500 shot up 0.72 per cent - to end just short of a record high - and the Nasdaq climbed 1.25 per cent.

"Putin indicated he isn't seeking 'a partition of Ukraine', soothing market fears (for now) that the crisis will escalate further," National Australian Bank said.

"It gave investors the chance to start focusing on the (Fed) meeting tonight."

While analysts expect a further cut in the bank's stimulus program as the economy picks up, they also predict it will scrap its unemployment rate threshold.

The Fed previously said unemployment must fall to 6.5 per cent before it considers raising interest rates.

MANNHEIM, Germany, March 18 (Reuters) - German analyst and investor sentiment plunged in March at the fastest pace in nearly a year amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could weigh on Europe’s largest economy, a leading survey showed on Tuesday.

Mannheim-based think tank ZEW’s monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts. The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

It was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

“The Crimea Crisis is weighing on expert’s economic expectations for Germany,” said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. “Nevertheless, the indicator’s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The United States and European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.

The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0 yet still underscoring the strength of the German economy.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said the combination of emerging market turbulences earlier this year and the stand-off between Russia and the West may have a “mildly dampening impact on Germany’s investment climate” and therefore on growth.

But he noted that “it would take a much more serious crisis in Ukraine to derail the recovery in Germany and the euro zone as a whole”.

The German economy, a growth locomotive in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8 percent this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.

Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January. Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.

The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said.###4446||Security and storage vendor names board member Brown named interim CEO as it begins search for a successor

For the second time in less than two years, Symantec Corp. has a new chief executive officer.

In a that surprised observers, the Mountain View, Calif-based security and storage vendor Thursday fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named board member Michael Brown as his interim replacement.

In a statement, Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said Bennett's organizational realignment and cost cutting efforts have positioned the company for future growth.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth," Schulman said.

The decision to terminate Bennett "was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," he added.

Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as Symantec CEO in July 2012. He was president and CEO of Intuit between 2000 and 2007 and joined Symantec's board in 2010.

In the 20 months or so that he was at the helm, Bennett did a decent job of managing the company, said Gene Ruth, lead Symantec analyst at Gartner.

"Bennett brought business acumen to Symantec," Ruth said. "He was a business architect type of person. My observation was that he was rearranging the organization and repositioning it," by bringing in new people and refreshing the company culture. "He was redirecting them to be more focused on delivering products that customers really wanted."

Some of the changes being implemented by Bennett required time to take hold, time he wasn't given. It doesn't happen in a month. But it looks like the board was not patient." Ruth said.

As recently as November, Gartner gave Symantec a positive rating for its efforts, Ruth noted. The chief criticisms at that time were that Symantec had to better realign its sales force and address some support issues related to one of its core data backup products.

"In general they were holding their own. It wasn't like they were grabbing a lot of market share, [but] it wasn't like they were losing market share." Clearly for Symantec's board though, maintaining market share does not appear to have been enough, Ruth said.

Newly named interim CEO Brown has been on Symantec's board of directors since the company acquired Veritas Software in July 2005. Brown sat on the Veritas board.

He was previously chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

Symantec today said the move won't impact its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The company still expects revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion, down from $1.74 billion in the same period last year, Symantec noted.

The chairman of Symantec's board, Daniel Schulman, said in a statement that Bennett's termination was "not precipitated by any event or impropriety," but rather the result of an ongoing deliberative process. Schulman also said that the board recognizes Bennett's contributions as CEO, which included "developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness."

Bennett has only been Symantec's CEO since July of 2012, and was chairman of Symantec's board from 2011 to 2013. Prior to joining Symantec, Bennett served as president and CEO of technology company Intuit from 2007 to 2011; before that, he had a 23-year career at General Electric , holding management roles in a variety of GE businesses including GE Capital, GE Appliances and GE Medical Systems.

Schulman said that Symantec's priority now is "to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

In the release announcing Bennett's termination, Symantec also reaffirmed its fourth quarter fiscal 2014 outlook, saying that it expects revenue of $1.6 to $1.66 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in the prior-year period. Including special items, it expects its fourth quarter profit to fall somewhere between 29 cents and 31 cents per share compared to 27 cents during the same time in 2013, and excluding those special items expects to see a profit between 40 cents and 42 cents per share, compared to 44 cents per share this same time last year.

Following the news that Bennett has been fired, shares of Symantec halted briefly in Thursday's after-hours trading session after finishing the day with a 1.58%; when trading resumed, shares fell as much as 10%. They've since recovered some of those losses and are currently down about 6.5%. After finishing 2013 trading with a 20% gain, Symantec shares have fallen 12.3% during the first two and a half months of 2014.###4448||Empty###4449||Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group has paid $215m for a minority stake in mobile messaging app maker Tango.

Tango said it raised $280m (£169m, €202m) in a new funding round led by the Chinese firm. Tango's prior investors, Access Industries, venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, also contributed.

The investment gives Alibaba a minority stake in the four-year-old company, estimated at between 20% and 25% by research firm VC Experts. The deal, which values Tango at about $1.1bn, is believed to be Alibaba's biggest investment in a US firm to date.

Tango has 200 million registered users and 70 million active users, with a significant footprint spread across North America, the Middle East, Taiwan and Singapore.

Tango co-founder Eric Setton told Reuters that his company, which offers games, multimedia sharing and other content, would in due course beat WhatsApp, which offers purely text and voice communications.

However the killer potential of apps like Tango and WhatsApp is that they allow users to send free texts or make free calls over a data connection, posing a growing threat to incumbent carriers.

"The platform approach I believe is the winning strategy," Setton said.

"We've now seen it in a number of key markets, with Kakao in Korea or Line in Japan."

Alibaba IPO

Alibaba is understood to have selected New York over Hong Kong for its forthcoming initial public offering.

The gargantuan US flotation is expected to value Alibaba at as much as $120bn (£72bn, €87bn).

Another given is that Alibaba will use the proceeds of the planned share sale to snap up a raft of companies, in a bid to expand its mobile phone services.

Competition

The Tango deal comes a month after social media giant Facebook's shocking $19bn acquisition of five-year old WhatsApp.

Alibaba has long recognised the threat posed by Chinese social media major Tencent's WeChat, a hugely popular messaging app that has evolved into an e-commerce platform.

Alibaba recently introduced a WeChat competitor called Laiwang, but the service has struggled to gain traction.###4450||SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hovered near a three-week peak against a basket of major currencies early on Friday, but could struggle to extend gains as investors awaited more clarity on the Federal Reserve’s policy path.

Fed officials including Richard Fisher, James Bullard and Narayana Kocherlakota are all due to speak later on Friday, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen surprised markets mid-week by suggesting the possibility of raising interest rates early next year.

U.S. yields have all moved higher as markets brought forward the risk of a Fed rate hike by April. The dollar index last traded at 80.192 .DXY, not far from the high of 80.354, a level not seen since late February.

“A heavy Fed speaker calendar Friday will be carefully parsed for any effort to roll back this week’s shift forward in tightening expectations,” analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients.

However, they noted that most of the Fed speakers are generally on the hawkish end of the spectrum.

“In any event, we would expect the Fed to struggle to fully reverse the move in rates...unless data begins to significantly disappoint expectations once again.”

U.S. data on Thursday was mixed but a rebound in factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region held out hope the economy might be regaining strength after being hobbled by severe weather.

Against the yen, the euro eased to 141.07 yen, back near the lower-end of this week’s 140.46-141.97 range.

The U.S. dollar struggled to make further gains on the Japanese currency after topping out at 102.69 on Wednesday. It last stood at 102.39.

The greenback also lost steam against the Canadian and Australian dollars. It last traded at C$1.1237 after reaching a 4-1/2 year high of C$1.1279, while the Aussie popped back above 90 U.S. cents from a low of $0.8995.

Trading in Asia is expected to be subdued with Japanese financial markets shut for a holiday.

There is little in the way of key economic data out of Asia on Friday although investors will be keeping a close eye on the yuan, which skidded to its lowest in more than a year at 6.2334 per dollar.

The Chinese currency is facing the prospect of posting its biggest weekly loss since 1992 after the People’s Bank of China at the weekend doubled the currency’s trading range to 2 percent either side of the midpoint it fixes daily.

Markets, already fretting about slower growth in the world’s second biggest economy, fear the sharp drop in the yuan could add more pressure on Chinese companies saddled with foreign currency debt.###4451||Wal-Mart takes aim at $2B market

NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop’s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###4452||Empty###4453||Symantec has fired president and chief executive Steve Bennett after less than two years on the job, as the world's largest maker of security software for PCs struggles with a shift to mobile devices.

The company named board member Michael Brown to lead while the company seeks Bennett's replacement.

Fired: Former Symantec CEO Steve Bennett.

A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, the company said on Thursday (Friday morning Australian time).

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem's ousting in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record slump in PC sales curbs spending on Symantec's anti-virus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock has tumbled 15 per cent in the past year.

Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.###4454||Empty###4455||A market dominated by GameStop is about to see another huge entrant as Walmart is set to launch a used video game purchasing program next week across its nationwide network of 3,100 retail stores. The Wall Street Journal reports that Walmart will begin buying used games next week and will pay gamers anywhere from a few dollars to $35 or more for used titles. Payments will be made in the form of Walmart gift cards that can be used to purchase any products from Walmart stores or the company’s website.

Walmart’s move into the space that has traditionally been dominated by GameStop comes as sales of Microsoft and Sony’s next-generation video game consoles really get underway. Despite the surge in console hardware sales, however, new software sales are still lagging — likely thanks in part to the large market for buying and selling used games.

Where gamers are concerned, Walmart’s move could lead to increased competition for used game acquisition. This could mean more money and more promotions ultimately being made available to gamers as Walmart, GameStop and other retailers battle for business.###4456||The state's unemployment rates continues to drop - while job creation in the Tampa Bay area is lagging behind the rest of the state.

That's according to the numbers released today by state economists. The state's unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work. Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

“With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we’re making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," the governor said in a prepared statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let’s keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one.”

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

Florida has added close to 200,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest amount in the nation according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But it was not such good news for the Tampa Bay area. The region lost 14,100 jobs and its unemployment rate rocketed back up to 6.5 percent from an adjusted 6 percent in December.###4457||Walmart to start offering in-store credit for used games

Big box retailer Walmart has announced that on March 26 it will begin accepting trade-ins of used video games for store credit that will allow customers to purchase anything in the store. Over 3,100 Walmart locations will participate in the program, though Sam's Club and neighborhood market locations will be unable to accept used games. That said, this credit will be usable at any Walmart location, and will even allow customers to purchase items online.

What's significant about this trade-in program is that it doesn't just apply to games. What that means is that although Walmart might not have as large a selection of games as Gamestop, it's still likely to take a fair chunk out of that retailer's bottom line, particularly if it offers customers a better deal for their old titles.

Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo famously have suffered both these maladies. Symantec, the world's largest security software provider, has now stumbled into those footsteps.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based data security and storage provider revealed March 20 that it has terminated the contract of chief executive Steve Bennett (pictured) after 20 months. Bennett, who came to Symantec as a board member in 2010 after CEO-ing Intuit to a $3 billion sales year, also resigned from the company's board of directors.

Board member Michael Brown will serve as interim CEO while the company, best known for its Norton antivirus and BackupExec software, begins its search for a permanent day-to-day leader.

Stock Price Took Big Hit

Investors were not pleased by the development. The stock closed at $20.91 March 21 but plummeted 13 percent to $18.20 in after-hours trading.

A number of industry analysts declared that they were surprised by the announcement. Symantec itself, however, contended that Bennett's exit was something the company had discussed for some months and did not happen as a result of anything inappropriate on his part.

The reason Bennett was shooed out of his corner office so early in his tenure goes way beyond his personal on-the-job performance. Bennett has long proven himself to be a competent corporate CEO; he just wasn't the right one for this job. In fact, few people on Earth are right for this job. The company is the one with serious and deep-seated problems.

In its simplest terms, Symantec is a well-established enterprise that didn't heed key trends and let new-gen IT slip by when it needed to retool several years ago. Its core business is protecting data and apps on desktop and laptop PCs; it didn't move quickly enough to invest in other lines of business when PC sales started slipping five years ago.

Symantec also didn't move to the cloud quickly enough; some of its older competitors moved faster to build products that use it. Symantec only recently cloud-ized its product line, and it's having issues getting customers to buy into the new products.

Asleep at the Wheel?

More than one person had been asleep at the wheel long before Bennett arrived.

There are multiple sides to this story, of course. Like many old-school IT vendors, Symantec has built-in problems marshaling a large global installed base in the small and midsize enterprise market. It's extremely difficult to get all those customers to pay for regular upgrades to their software when they often think it's not required. Microsoft has, um, a modicum of experience in this department.

The other major problem is the type of IT in which Symantec plays. No sector evolves faster or more thoroughly than security, which is always chasing the bad guys and never—and we do mean NEVER—getting ahead of them so as to cut them off at the pass.

As a result, a great many new, less-expensive and more agile competitors from places like Eastern Europe and Israel have sprung up, and Symantec has been taking hits as a result.

Insider Perspective

One of those competitors is Justin Moore, CEO of Axcient. The company has a well-known billboard up on the Bayshore Freeway—Interstate 101, which traverses the center of Silicon Valley and connects San Francisco on the north with San Jose on the south—that says: "R.I.P. Symantec BackupExec.cloud; Axcient Beyond Backup."

While it's clear where Moore's loyalties lie, he also provides some cogent storage-business insider perspective.

"When Steve Bennett turned around Intuit in his tenure from 2000 to 2007, the company's problem was mainly a core business and processes challenge. However, Symantec is different; the company has a technology problem," Moore told eWEEK.

"Bennett was given a year and half to turn around a company that has much deeper challenges that relate to how it has been viewing technology, which is the core of its business. When Bennett announced his vision for Symantec 4.0, which was announced less than a year ago, he made the right choices—for the most part. Yet, Symantec was already too far behind the cloud/SaaS (software-as-a-service) curve to catch up. A change of this magnitude is impossible in less than 3 to 5 years," Moore said.

Corporate Errors Add Up

Symantec is pinning the failure on Bennett—when, in reality, the core of its failing stems from decisions made years ago, Moore said.

"Symantec lacks product focus and has spread itself too thin over a variety of product lines that spans security, productivity, protection, information management, business continuity and storage in the consumer and enterprise market. Like so many other enterprise software companies, it has struggled to transition to the enterprise cloud world proving that it is indeed a systemic issue that goes far beyond Bennett's control. Given his spectacular overhaul of Intuit's business, Bennett was the right person to tackle Symantec and had shown bold ideas to fix the company, but was ultimately thrown out by Symantec's stubbornness and shortsighted approach to its technological challenges," Moore said.

Symantec has struggled in recent years against new-gen security companies such as Axcient, Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, crafted in an effort to become a serious data storage player, was widely critiqued as a mistake. Symantec's sales have been treading water for several years.

Leadership Turnover Since 2005

Symantec's leadership turnover issues started back in 2005, when the company merged with storage provider Veritas to combine it with the Norton data protection product line. Co-CEOs John Thompson (then incumbent at Symantec) and Gary Bloom (from Veritas) didn't exactly see eye-to-eye on how to run the company, and Bloom soon left for other ventures. He now heads up database maker MarkLogic.

Thompson, who was on the short list to be Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration in 2008, left in 2009 to do start up Virtual Instruments and is now chairman of the board of Microsoft. He was replaced by longtime Symantec executive Enrique Salem.

However, the well-rounded Salem also was deposed as CEO a mere three years later (2012) in favor of Bennett. Now Bennett's out the door after less than two years.

In its requisite thank you statement using Chairman Daniel Schulman's name, the board said: "We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

So the House of Norton and BackupExec is facing a real crossroads. A lot will be riding on the new face it selects to represent Symantec in the world market.###4461||Empty###4462||The US dollar exchange rate complex has seen a strong 24 hours with the US unit proving to be the best performer on Wednesday.

Dollar Soars as End of ZIRP in Sight

The Federal Reserve left investors with a very clear message overnight.

Janet Yellen began to set expectations for tightening. Bernanke went to lengths to make it known than tapering does not equal tightening but Yellen spoke about how and when rates will be increased.

"In fact there was an entire new paragraph dedicated to how the central bank will approach the removal of policy accommodation and what sent stocks plunging and the dollar soaring was Yellen's comment that the first rate will most likely be 6 months after Quantitative Easing ends," says Kathy Lien at BK Asset Management.

According to Lien if the Fed maintains its current pace of tapering, asset purchases will cease in the fall, which means that the first rate hike will be in the summer of 2015.

The net result has been a bullish US dollar exchange rate complex and a weaker commodity dollar complex.

MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in its native Japan after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around £210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole. It has since taken the same action through the US courts.

Following the debacle, CEO Mark Karpeles's personal blog and Reddit account were hacked, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.

MtGox's opponents have criticised its latest move, describing its bankruptcy protection filing in the US as a "ruse" in an attempt to divert attention from instances of "massive fraud".

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

Gox blamed for losing nearly half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins.

The open-source software, known as Bitcoin-QT, has also been rebranded as "Bitcoin Core" to highlight that it runs the core infrastructure of the virtual currency's transaction and verification network.

Upgrading Bitcoin's software is a delicate operation, and many of the changes have been under discussion for months. The market capitalization of all bitcoins in circulation is roughly US$8 billion, according to figures from Blockchain.info, and a mistake could be costly.

But the virtual currency has weathered innumerable negative events over the past five years and is still seeing growing adoption by businesses and retailers as an alternative payment platform.

The value of a bitcoin wobbled only slightly after Mt. Gox, at one time the largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28 and in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas on March 9.

In early February, Mt. Gox said it was investigating a long-known security problem called "transaction malleability," which in some cases can allow attackers to make it falsely appear they haven't received a bitcoin payment if an exchange isn't properly validating transactions.

Other exchanges briefly halted trading while inspecting their code, but bitcoin experts said highly customized software written by Mt. Gox likely exacerbated the problem.

After filing for bankruptcy, Mt.Gox said the bug was possibly responsible for the missing bitcoins, valued at US$474 million at the time. It has not yet provided a clearer explanation for the losses.

The latest version of bitcoin's software, 0.9.0, contains more than a half dozen fixes for transaction malleability, according to the release notes for the software.

Bitcoin Core also contains a new feature for payment requests. Previously, merchants couldn't attach a note describing an invoice, and people also could not supply a refund address to a merchant.

The latest version automatically supplies a refund address. The payment requests can also be cryptographically signed to ensure the bitcoins are going to the intended recipient, wrote Wladimir van der Laan of the Bitcoin Core Development Team.

The improvements help make bitcoin more usable for commerce. Lann wrote that future Bitcoin Core releases will aim to fine tune the software, improving its functionality and the users' experiences.

Developers creating bitcoin-compatible software are advised to incorporate the software changes into their own "wallets," which are software programs for holding and transferring bitcoins, and other payments applications.

(NYSE: BA) released their joint critical systems review of Boeing’s 787-8 Dreamliner Wednesday. The review was initiated in January 2013, after a series of problems with the plane’s electrical system and batteries surfaced and eventually caused the entire fleet of 787s to be grounded for three months.

The review team consisted of six FAA officials and seven Boeing employees, who spent six months validating the 787’s certification process. The review committee’s report stated:

The CSRT [critical systems review team] determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane’s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification.

The review team made four recommendations:

Boeing should establish a means to ensure suppliers identify program risks and complementary mitigation plans. Boeing should continue to implement and mature the gated design and production processes with sufficient resources for development programs, and to minimize risks throughout the life cycle of the program. (“Gated” design establishes a series of programmatic criteria (gates) that must be met before moving to the next development phase.) Boeing should ensure suppliers are fully aware of their responsibilities, including integration responsibilities and accountability for subtier performance. Boeing should require its suppliers to follow industry standards for the training, qualification and certification of supplier personnel performing Boeing-required (non-FAA) inspections.

The panel also recommended that the FAA make three changes to its policy and guidance documents.

The CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane division said:

The findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise.

Boeing stock was down about 0.1% in the noon hour Wednesday, at $123.89 in a 52-week range of $83.80 to $144.57.###4474||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- A new round of funding could value Airbnb at over $10 billion, signifying the company's role as a disruptive force in the hotel industry.

Private-equity firm TPG Capital is expected to lead the funding over the next few weeks -- negotiations are still in progress -- possibly bringing in up to $400 million for the property rental upstart.

The idea for Airbnb was conceived in 2008 by three Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard graduates who relocated to San Francisco, originally calling the site Airbedandbreakfast.com.

Since its inception, Airbnb has become a leader in the share economy. The site is a destination for millions of tourists looking for cheap rooms, while giving homeowners a new source of income.

Airbnb's reach spans 160 countries with more than 600,000 listings, and the site has accommodated 11 million guests in its five-year history, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company said it had a record 250,000 guests in one night on New Year's Eve 2013.

The hotel industry has begun to take notice of the company's tremendous growth.

Airbnb has cut into the industry's market share by offering cheap prices and unconventional accommodations. For example, a person can stay in a large treehouse in Hawaii for under $100 a night, much less than comparable hotel prices in the area.

The novelty of the living arrangement, along with the cheap rates, has many tourists checking with Airbnb before looking into more traditional accommodations. Airbnb takes 3% from a host's booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.

The hotel industry has complained, saying that the site is not subject to the same regulation and tax structure that traditional hotels are, making the competition unfair.

Homeowners in New York and San Francisco have questioned the legality of Airbnb's practices regarding subletting property, and tenants say the site has diminished the supply of rental properties, driving up long-term rents.

Amid the criticism, current valuations of Airbnb make it worth more than Hyatt Hotels (H), valued at $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), valued at $9.39 billion, signaling investors see the site as the possible future of travel stay.

TPG Capital's new round of funding indicates that a public offering may be in the company's future. That would give the site fresh capital to expand advertising and hire new employees.

As a public company, Airbnb could become a marquee name in the world of short-term travel accommodations.

The settlement announced on Friday would resolve claims in two lawsuits filed in New York by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies.

It is the ninth settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011, when it filed 18 lawsuits over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

The accord resolves claims pending in New York federal court against Credit Suisse over $16.6 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and ends what the Swiss bank called the largest mortgage-related investor litigation it still faced.

Credit Suisse will pay $234 million to Fannie Mae and $651 million to Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.

So far, the FHFA has recovered more than $10.1 billion from banks over similar securities.

This includes nearly $9.8 billion in settlements of litigation with such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The FHFA also reached a separate $335.2 million accord with Wells Fargo & Co, which it did not formally sue.

Many of the settlements were reached after a series of series of court rulings that went against the banks.

Lawsuits remain pending against several other banks, including Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

Credit Suisse said on Friday it will reduce previously reported fourth-quarter and 2013 results by 275 million Swiss francs ($311.17 million) after taxes for the settlement, resulting in a fourth-quarter net loss of 8 million Swiss francs.

While Credit Suisse said the settlement resolves the biggest mortgage case it faced, the bank still must deal with other mortgage cases in the United States, including ones by the National Credit Union Administration and attorneys general in New York and New Jersey.

Credit Suisse is also one of 14 Swiss banks targeted by U.S. prosecutors for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank has said it is trying to settle that matter.

Last month, the Zurich-based bank agreed to pay $196.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it provided unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients.

The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06200.###4476||The latest clue in the two-week search for a missing Malaysia Airlines jet comes from a French satellite, which has picked up images of what may be debris from the Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean.

In a statement Sunday, Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said the country had received images from French authorities “showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor.” Search efforts have been focused on this area, southwest of Perth, Australia, after both Chinese and Australian satellites picked up evidence of objects floating in the area in the past week, the Associated Press reports.

No evidence of the missing flight MH370 has been found, although searchers discovered a wooden pallet of the sort used when loading some airplanes. The airliner has been missing since March 8 after vanishing while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people, most of them Chinese nationals, on board.

Authorities say the search could be hampered Sunday by a tropical cyclone in the vicinity.

Twitter has taken action against the Turkish government’s blocking of access to it and hired a lawyer expert in litigations related to cyberlaw.Lawyer Gönenç Gürkaynak has confirmed that he was meeting with officials from Turkey’s Telecommunications Authority (TİB) in Ankara on behalf of Tweeter, adding that discussions for finding a legal solution were ongoing. In the past, Gürkaynak had worked on the legal case against the ban on YouTube.But a government minister stressed that Twitter get a permanent legal representative and enhance its cooperation with the Turkish authorities.Industry Minister Fikri Işık said that the microblogging website should agree to block individual accounts if it is to resolve a row that has led the government to block access to the service.Meanwhile, The Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) filed a petition March 21 to an Istanbul court for the lifting of the ban.In a written statement, TBB head Metin Feyzioğlu said the Istanbul Prosecutor’s Office had lost all its authority with the recent legal changes removing specially authorized prosecutors and therefore could not rule to implement such a ban.“With the ban, the TTB and millions of citizens cannot access Twitter for reasons we still do not know,” the statement read. “A total ban on Twitter access is a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Turkish Constitution and Law 5651 that includes Internet regulations. The TTB has applied to the courts for the immediate lifting of the ban. In addition, criminal complaints have been filed for those responsible for the ban ruling and the officials who applied the ban,” Feyzioğlu said in the statement.One of the court decisions on which the Twitter ban was based reportedly followed a complaint filed by former Transport Minister Binali Yıldırım and Erkam Yıldırım on March 18, daily Hürriyet corresponded Dinçer Gökçe has reported.A decision by the 5th Criminal Court of Peace ruled for the closure of the Twitter account, http://twitter.com/oyyokhırsıza, following the complaint.They also asked for a block on another website, http://hirsizaoyyok.wordpress.com.###4480||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form a store credit.

The world's largest retailer began offering the feature, called "Savings Catcher," on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Citibank launched a similar program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if Citibank finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.###4484||Investing.com - The dollar traded mixed against most major currencies on Monday as investors applauded waning fears that the Ukraine standoff will escalate, hit-or-miss U.S. production data softened the greenback.

In U.S. trading on Monday, was up 0.07% at 1.3923.

Investors spent the session digesting events in Europe, after over 90% of Crimean voters on Sunday chose to break with Ukraine and join Russia. Crimea's Parliament on Monday formally asked to join the Russian Federation.

Sanctions followed as expected.

European Union foreign ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people they have linked to the push to have Crimea secede from Ukraine and be annexed by Russia. U.S. President Barack Obama also imposed sanctions on several Russian officials involved in the incursion of Crimea, which included freezing assets in the U.S.

Still, markets were expecting more widespread action from the West, and the response enticed investors away from safe-haven gold positions, which softened the precious metal.

Gold has served as a safe-haven of choice during the Ukraine crisis, and the dollar found room to rise somewhat as gold fell, as the two assets tend to trade inversely with one another.

Hit-or-miss U.S. economic indicators watered down gains.

Data revealed earlier that U.S. industrial production rose 0.6% in February, exceeding expectations for a 0.1% gain. Industrial production in January was revised to a 0.2% fall from a previously estimated 0.3% decline.

In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State manufacturing index ticked up to 5.6 this month from 4.5 in February, missing expectations for a rise to 6.0.

The conflicting data sent many to the sidelines awaiting the Federal Reserve's March decision on monetary policy due out on Wednesday, the first under new Chair Janet Yellen.

Meanwhile in Europe, official data revealed earlier that the euro zone's consumer price index rose 0.3% last month, below expectations for a 0.4% increase, after a 1.1% decline in January.

Year-on-year, consumer price inflation rose 0.7% in February, compared to expectations for a 0.8% increase, after a 0.8% gain in January.

However, core consumer price inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco, rose 0.5% in February, after a 1.7% fall the previous month and in line with market expectations.

The euro zone's core consumer price index rose 1.0% in February, also in line with expectations.

Monetary authorities pay close attention to core consumer prices when deciding policy.

The dollar was up against the yen, with up 0.39% at 101.75, and up against the Swiss franc, with up 0.10% at 0.8730.

The greenback was up against the pound, with down 0.08% at 1.6632.

The dollar was down against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with down 0.45% at 1.1055, up 0.60% at 0.9086 and up 0.40% at 0.8568.

The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.03% at 79.50.

On Tuesday, the U.S. is to produce data on consumer inflation, in addition to reports on building permits and housing starts.###4485||Empty###4486||(Fixes spelling error in paragraph 8)

TOKYO, March 21 (Reuters) - Mt. Gox said on Friday it found 200,000 “forgotten” bitcoins on March 7, a week after the Tokyo-based digital currency exchange filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it lost nearly all the 850,000 bitcoins it held, worth some $500 million at today’s prices.

Mt. Gox made the announcement on its website. Online sleuths had noticed around 200,000 bitcoins moving through the crypto-currency exchange after the bankruptcy filing.

The exchange, headed by 28-year-old Frenchman Mark Karpeles, said the bitcoins were found in an old-format online wallet which it had thought no longer held any bitcoins, but which it checked again after its bankruptcy filing.

“On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC,” the statement said.

It added that it moved the 200,000 bitcoins from online to offline wallets on March 14-15 “for security reasons.” “These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels,” it noted.

Many of Mt. Gox’s 127,000 creditors, who feared they had lost their investments when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, are skeptical about what the exchange has said happened to the bitcoins it had. In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox also said $28 million was “missing” from its Japanese bank accounts.

BITCOIN TRACKING

On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago overseeing a class action against Mt. Gox revised a previous order, allowing some of the exchange’s bitcoin movements to be tracked.

“Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we’ve been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it “found” these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins,” Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters in emailed comments.

Edelson is representing Illinois resident Gregory Greene, who proposed the class action over what he claims is a massive fraud. Mt. Gox blamed the loss of 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own on hackers who attacked its software.

Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins is now about $7 billion. (Additional reporting by Tom Hals in DELAWARE; Editing by Ian Geoghegan and Miral Fahmy)###4487||The software driving Bitcoin's network was upgraded Wednesday, with security fixes addressing a problem that defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox blamed for losing nearly half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins.

The open-source software, known as Bitcoin-QT, has also been rebranded as "Bitcoin Core" to highlight that it runs the core infrastructure of the virtual currency's transaction and verification network.

Upgrading Bitcoin's software is a delicate operation, and many of the changes have been under discussion for months. The market capitalization of all bitcoins in circulation is roughly US$8 billion, according to figures from Blockchain.info, and a mistake could be costly.

But the virtual currency has weathered innumerable negative events over the past five years and is still seeing growing adoption by businesses and retailers as an alternative payment platform.

The value of a bitcoin wobbled only slightly after Mt. Gox, at one time the largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28 and in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas on March 9.

In early February, Mt. Gox said it was investigating a long-known security problem called "transaction malleability," which in some cases can allow attackers to make it falsely appear they haven't received a bitcoin payment if an exchange isn't properly validating transactions.

Other exchanges briefly halted trading while inspecting their code, but bitcoin experts said highly customized software written by Mt. Gox likely exacerbated the problem.

After filing for bankruptcy, Mt.Gox said the bug was possibly responsible for the missing bitcoins, valued at US$474 million at the time. It has not yet provided a clearer explanation for the losses.

The latest version of bitcoin's software, 0.9.0, contains more than a half dozen fixes for transaction malleability, according to the release notes for the software.

Bitcoin Core also contains a new feature for payment requests. Previously, merchants couldn't attach a note describing an invoice, and people also could not supply a refund address to a merchant.

The latest version automatically supplies a refund address. The payment requests can also be cryptographically signed to ensure the bitcoins are going to the intended recipient, wrote Wladimir van der Laan of the Bitcoin Core Development Team.

The improvements help make bitcoin more usable for commerce. Lann wrote that future Bitcoin Core releases will aim to fine tune the software, improving its functionality and the users' experiences.

Developers creating bitcoin-compatible software are advised to incorporate the software changes into their own "wallets," which are software programs for holding and transferring bitcoins, and other payments applications.

The country's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers bought its mobile-service business in 2008 from China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. as part of a government-mandated restructuring of the telecommunications sector and has spent heavily on the business.

Analysts have said that China Telecom's profitability is expected to improve from 2013 as its efforts to attract high-spending users begin to pay off.

Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 17.55 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) from 14.95 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 14% to 321.58 billion yuan.

China's telecommunications carriers have focused on improving their networks to meet an increase in data traffic as more consumers replace basic cellphones with smartphones. China has already overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest smartphone market and mobile-data demand is expected to rise.

China Unicom, another major Chinese carrier, reported last month a 47% increase in full-year earnings as smaller players continue to attract customers from market leader China Mobile Ltd.

China Mobile, the world's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, reports full-year earnings on Thursday and is expected to post a profit fall as it boosted network investments and handset subsidies to battle competition.

China Telecom and China Unicom will benefit from lower interconnection fees that they pay to China Mobile from the beginning of this year, as the government seeks to promote competition in the sector. Savings from lower interconnection fees will allow smaller carriers to fund network upgrades and marketing campaigns, allowing them to boost market share, analysts said.

China Mobile is the country's dominant mobile phone network carrier, with more than 770 million mobile subscribers and over 50% of domestic market share. China Telecom is the smallest of the country's three main mobile carriers.

* Focus on Putin speech later in session

* U.S. CPI, housing-related data awaited

By Shinichi Saoshiro

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen was on the defensive and the euro stood firm in early trade on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 101.88 yen, pulling further away from a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday, helped by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields as safety demand for government debt receded. Bond yields fall as prices rise.

The euro stood at $1.3927, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

After Sunday’s referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

“In immediate focus is Russian president Putin’s speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

“But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving U.S. government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar,” he said.

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia’s State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow’s involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia’s armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8734, pulling further away from a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8696 hit last week as investor risk aversion ebbed for the moment.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, was at 79.376, edging up from a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the U.S. consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar’s likely direction.###4490||Empty###4491||PERTH, AUSTRALIA—Aircraft and ships from China headed to the desolate southern Indian Ocean to join the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, now lost for two full weeks, and Australia promised its best efforts to resolve “an extraordinary riddle.” A satellite spotted two large objects in the area earlier this week, raising hopes of finding the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board. Three Australian planes took off at dawn Saturday for a third day of scouring the region about 2,500 kilometres southwest of Perth.

Australian officials tried to tamp down expectations after a fruitless search Friday, even as they pledged to continue the effort. “It’s about the most inaccessible spot that you could imagine on the face of the Earth, but if there is anything down there, we will find it,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at a news conference in Papua New Guinea. “We owe it to the families and the friends and the loved ones of the almost 240 people on Flight MH370 to do everything we can to try to resolve what is as yet an extraordinary riddle,” he added.

Six aircraft were to search the region Saturday: two ultra long-range commercial jets and four P3 Orions, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. While the Orions are able to search for only two hours at a time, the commercial jets can stay in the search area for five hours before they must head back to the base. Two merchant ships were in the area, and the HMAS Success, a navy supply ship, was due to arrive late Saturday afternoon. Weather in the search zone was expected to be relatively good, with some cloud cover. Two Chinese aircraft are expected to arrive in Perth on Saturday to join the search, and two Japanese aircraft will arrive Sunday. A small flotilla of ships from China is still several days away. AMSA officials also were checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information.

Abbott spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing him as “devastated.” The passengers included 154 Chinese. In Kuala Lumpur, where the plane took off for Beijing, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein thanked the more than two dozen countries involved in the overall search that stretches from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

The search area indicated by the satellite images in the southern Indian Ocean is a four-hour round-trip flight from western Australia, leaving planes with only enough fuel to search for about two hours. The images were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them. Searchers on Friday relied mostly on trained spotters aboard the planes rather than radar, which found nothing Thursday, Australian officials said. The search will focus more on visual sightings because civilian aircraft are being brought in. The military planes will continue to use both radar and spotters. “Noting that we got no radar detections yesterday, we have replanned the search to be visual. So aircraft flying relatively low, very highly skilled and trained observers looking out of the aircraft windows and looking to see objects,” said John Young, manager of the maritime safety authority’s emergency response division. Malaysia asked the U.S. for undersea surveillance equipment to help in the search, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. There is a limited battery life for the beacons in the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders — about 30 days, said Chuck Schofield, vice-president of business development for Dukane Seacom Inc. The devices work to a depth of 6,100 metres, with a signal range of about two nautical miles, depending on variables like sea conditions. The signals are located using a device operated on the surface of the water or towed to a depth. Experts say it is impossible to tell if the grainy satellite images of the two objects — one 24 metreslong and the other measuring 5 metres — were debris from the plane. But officials have called this the best lead so far in the search that began March 8 after the plane vanished over the Gulf of Thailand on an overnight flight to Beijing. Aircraft pieces have sometimes been found floating for days after a sea crash. Peter Marosszeky, an aviation expert at the University of New South Wales, said the wing could remain buoyant for weeks if fuel tanks inside it were empty and had not filled with water. Other experts said that if the aircraft breaks into pieces, normally only items such as seats and luggage would remain floating. “We seldom see big metal (pieces) floating. You need a lot of (buoyant) material underneath the metal to keep it up,” said Lau Kin-tak, an expert in aircraft maintenance and accidents at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Director Teresa Wahlert said in a release that Iowa had the fifth-lowest average unemployment rate in the nation last year at 4.6 percent. The number of unemployed increased to 71,700 in January from 71,000 in December. The total number of people working was slightly more than 1.6 million. Layoffs in trade, transportation and construction contributed to the decline in employment in January. X###4493||Staying on the taper path, the Federal Open Market Committee today said it would trim its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities from $65 billion to $55 billion. All three major U.S. stock indices were down on the committee's afternoon statement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI)falling 44 points as of 3 p.m. EDT.

The Federal Reserve in recent months has moved away from its stance connecting the unemployment rate to its readiness to lift interest rates, and that trend continued today. While the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, it's mostly because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search. The Fed recognizes that issue and today announced that it would drop the unemployment rate as the primary measuring stick for the economy's strength. It will instead rely on a multitude of factors to decide when raising interest rates is the correct move. With that in mind, here are some large industrial companies making headlines today.

Inside the Dow, Boeing (NYSE:BA) had a couple of favorable headlines hit the news feed today. Boeing and Comair announced an order for eight 737 MAX 8s, the first such order from an African operator. The order was actually booked in December 2013 but was previously unidentified on the Boeing orders and deliveries website; it is valued at $830 million at list prices. This order will support future fleet expansion for the brands operated by Comair. There's also an option for the carrier to take another eight aircraft in the future.

In other positive news for the aviation juggernaut, the Federal Aviation Administration announced today that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is safe after a thorough review of its lithium-ion battery issues.

"We concluded that the aircraft was soundly designed, and that Boeing and the FAA had processes in place that were designed to identify and correct any issue that might arise during the manufacturing process," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said, according to USA Today. "It's many layered. You don't have single points of failure."

This is welcome news for Boeing investors who have grown weary of the Dreamliner project running over budget due to production delays and other issues. As production of the 787 Dreamliner continues to accelerate, investors hope the project will become profitable for Boeing in 2016.

Outside the Dow, investors of General Motors are hoping that its recent recalls of millions of vehicles globally doesn't turn into a nightmare akin to Toyota's (NYSE:TM) unintended acceleration problems. Toyota just agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine, which is the largest penalty imposed on any automaker, according to federal prosecutors. Ultimately, the defect led to a recall of more than 10 million vehicles and the company's admission to concealing information and making false statements regarding safety issues.

"Other car companies should not repeat Toyota's mistake," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned in a statement, according to Automotive News. "A recall may damage a company's reputation, but deceiving your customers makes that damage far more lasting."

Toyota will record the $1.2 billion in after-tax charges against earnings. While this is a huge penalty it won't put a dent in the automaker's cash pile of nearly $60 billion. That said, this drawn-out process could have larger ramifications for its brand inside the automotive industry, where Toyota long ago captured the image of reliability and safety. While General Motors is beginning its own battle with ignition issues linked to at least 12 deaths, Toyota's tarnished image could open up the door for Ford to continue increasing its market share and positive brand image in the U.S. market.###4494||Why did this happen?

"The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them," the bank said in a statement.



The bank added, that the cardholders can still withdraw cash from the ATMs of Rossiya and its partner banks Sobinbank and the United Payment System.



The bank is allegedly closed to the Kremlin regime and is subjected to international sanctions over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.



The news signalled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia.



Earlier sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials.



Sobinbank, part of the Rossiya banking group, said, quoted by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, that its call centers had been swamped by customers who were abroad and suddenly found their cards were not working.



Also affected was the Russian SMP Bank, majority owned by brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who were named as individuals in the US sanctions list.



“All other operations, including the issuance of deposits and making payments remain unaffected and without any restrictions,” SMP Bank said in a statement, adding that it has no assets in the United States.###4498||In a rare public statement, the CEO of the embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that the company has found an “old format wallet” containing approximately 200,000 bitcoins. At present exchange rates, that sum is worth over $115 million.

In the Japanese and English-language statement (PDF) posted to the company’s website on Thursday, CEO Mark Karpeles explained that the company confirmed the discovery on March 7, 2014 and reported it to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo on March 10.

Mt. Gox has filed for both bankruptcy protection in its native Japan and in the US.

“Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC. (Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation),” wrote Karpeles

Mt. Gox has said that it has lost 750,000 bitcoins (around $412.5 million) belonging to customers, and over 100,000 bitcoins (around $55 million) of its own money. The site suddenly shut down last month after weeks of sustained DDoS attacks and “transaction malleability” problems, which led the company to halt withdrawals entirely. (That problem was finally patched on Thursday.)

As far as the purported internal documents that were released in February, Karpeles previously told Ars, “I cannot comment on documents not issued by us,” but he did not deny their authenticity.

Since then, Karpeles has not responded to Ars’ repeated requests for comment.###4499||The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration proposed new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

"Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can't finish, we won't shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don't have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can't get coverage again until next year," HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare's six-month enrollment period. Most of those bug have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website's capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.###4500||Empty###4501||Next week, Walmart will begin accepting trade-ins of used video games for store credit that can purchase anything offered by the giant retailer.

The program, announced today, will begin on March 26. Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing offer, Duncan Mac Naughton, said the company was "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," a market GameStop dominates in the United States.

Walmart will accept used-game trade-ins at more than 3,100 stores in the U.S.. Trade-ins will not be accepted at the company's Sam's Club or neighborhood market locations (or where prohibited by local law) but the store credit one receives for a trade-in at a Walmart is usable at any Walmart location, or online.

Additionally, beginning this summer, Walmart will begin offering pre-owned games in its store and online. The retailer launched this ad to spread news of the program.





Walmart dabbled in used game trade-ins before, albeit through kiosks it tried out in certain stores in 2009; the plan didn't work and was discontinued. Currently Walmart accepts trade-ins of tablets, smartphones, mp3 players and other devices, but not game consoles.###4502||A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"we are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Three-penny bit".

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"we're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (ISIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, Queen Elizabeth's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman said: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency." National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

* Focus on Putin speech later in session

* U.S. CPI, housing-related data awaited

By Shinichi Saoshiro

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen stayed below a recent peak against the dollar and the euro stood firm on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar held steady at 101.76 yen, staying above a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday. The dollar gained some support against the yen after U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday as safety demand for government debt receded.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.3934, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit on Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

Against the yen, the euro edged up 0.1 percent to about 141.79 yen.

After Sunday’s referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and the European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

“In immediate focus is Russian president Putin’s speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

“But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving U.S. government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar,” he said.

PUTIN SPEECH

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia’s State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow’s involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia’s armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

One possible resistance level for the dollar against the yen now lies around 102.30 yen, said Philip Wee, senior currency economist for DBS Bank in Singapore.

The dollar’s 20-day moving average now lies roughly around 102.30 yen, while the 100-day moving average comes in slightly above that level, around 102.38 yen.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8729. The dollar had hit a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8698 against the Swiss franc last week on trading platform EBS, but has since pulled up from that trough as investor risk aversion ebbed.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, was at 79.355, clinging above a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the U.S. consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar’s likely direction.###4506||A new-look £1 coin will have a familiar look but its hi-tech design will help to confound the counterfeiters who target the economy.

But there is no certainly it will be weighing down pockets north of the border because of the little matter of Scottish independence.

Chancellor George Osborne will today announce that the UK is to get the ultra-secure £1 coin. However, Treasury sources made clear it would come into force in Scotland only if there was a No vote in September's referendum.

The new coin will have the same shape as the old 12-sided three pence piece, known in pre-decimalisation days as the "thrupenny bit".

The current £1 coin has been in circulation for more than 30 years, which is much longer than the normal life cycle of a British coin. But it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters. Of the 1.5billion in circulation, the Royal Mint estimates 3%, representing £45m, are fakes. In some parts of the UK, the number of forgeries is as high as 6%.

The Treasury explained that while law enforcement agencies were successfully cracking down on the counterfeiters, the only sustainable way forward was to introduce a new, highly secure coin, that would reduce costs to business and the taxpayer.

The expectation is the new coin will be introduced in 2017. It is intended that, as with the current £1 coin, its obverse side will have images that represent the different parts of the UK.

But a senior Whitehall source stressed that, because all the main Westminster parties had ruled out a currency union between the UK and Scotland in the event of a Yes vote, then there would be no new Scottish £1 coin if Scots opted for independence. "The new coin would not be legal tender in Scotland and so would never come into circulation there," he explained.

The Royal Mint says the new £1 coin will be the most secure in the world. It will be of bi-metallic construction, consisting of two colours, and will include systems that will incorporate three tiers of banknote-strength security.

"After 30 years' loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," said a senior Treasury source.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it is vital we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."

The source pointed out there would be a consultation with industry, but insisted any changeover costs to business would be kept to a minimum because of new technology. The Payments Council, the Automatic Vending Association, the British Retail Consortium and the British Parking Association all welcomed the announcement.

He said the new design was a "fitting tribute" to Britain's heritage, sharing the same shape as the old three pence coin, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. The old threepenny bit was the first to have the dodecagon shape, which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War as its distinctiveness made it the easiest coin to recognise during the air-raid blackouts.###4507||Empty###4508||Australian marine authorities have detected several pieces of debris in the southern Indian Ocean that may be related to the Malaysia Airline flight that has been missing for nearly two weeks. If the debris spotted by satellites—some 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth—is conclusively linked to the plane, it would suggest the Beijing-bound flight flew for hours in the opposite direction of its intended destination.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority

Satellite photos released by the Australian government show two indistinguishable objects. Here’s one:

The area cited is roughly 6,000 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, near the limits of the distance the Boeing 777 could have flown. It’s an extremely remote stretch of ocean—situated between Australia, Antarctica, and Africa—which roughly corresponds to the southern track of the plane’s possible route, as suggested by satellite data transmitted by its engines:

In their full statement, the Australians were careful to say that the debris might not be from the plane, and that visibility in the area was poor. One of the pieces of debris was 24 meters (78 feet) long.

Four aircraft and a merchant ship are headed to the area, as well as an Australian Navy vessel that is several days away.

US officials told CNN a week ago that there was a “significant likelihood” that the plane was on the bottom of the Indian Ocean, citing information that Malaysia shared with the US.

Australia was tasked with searching the southern route that the plane might have taken—an area that covered 600,000 square kilometers of ocean, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which led the search.

On March 19, the authority released a map of a more specific area it was searching:

It also released more specific information on the flight path the plane may have taken, based on information from the US transportation officials, which helped determine the area of interest:

John Young, the head of the emergency response team at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said during a press conference: “We will continue this until we locate these objects or are convinced we cannot find them.” The AMSA “continues to hold grave concerns for the passengers and crew on board.”###4509||Etowah County’s unemployment rate spiked upward in January, while the state unemployment rate remained steady, according to statistics released Monday by the Alabama Department of Labor.

Etowah County’s unemployment rate spiked upward in January, while the state unemployment rate remained steady, according to statistics released Monday by the Alabama Department of Labor.

Etowah County’s unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in January, up from December’s 5.6 percent.

Every county in the state saw its unemployment rate rise in January.

The state rate, which is seasonally adjusted while county rates are not, remained at 6.1 percent.

The non-seasonally adjusted state unemployment rate would have increased from 5.7 percent in December to 6.8 percent in January.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique that attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns to reveal how employment and unemployment change from month to month.

The county’s unemployment rate dropped for three consecutive months last year before seeing an increase in December.###4510||By continuing to browse our site you agree to our use of cookies, privacy policy and terms of service. Accept###4511||Crimea and Russia's finances





By Vestnik Kavkaza



The Russian ruble will be officially launched in the territory of Crimea on March 24th. At the moment the ruble exchange rate is growing in Crimean exchange offices. In Russia the ruble is strengthening in the context of reduction of geopolitical risks.



However, yesterday the USA decided to extend the list of Russian officials against whom strict sanctions are launched. 20 people have been included on the list, including the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, his deputy Alexei Gromov, the State Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin, the leader of A Just Russia Sergei Mironov, businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, businessman Yuri Kovalchuk, the owner of Volga Group Gennady Timchenko and the head of Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin. The US President stated that sanctions were being launched against “organizations which provide material support to the Russian government”, i.e. the bank ‘Rossiya’. Barack Obama also signed an order on possible sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy. Whether the sanctions will affect ordinary citizens of Russia is not clear.



Oleg Kazakovtsev, a member of the Federation Council Committee on Budgets and Financial Markets, says that people are only interested in one type of question: “If I have certain savings, will these savings remain? What should I do with them? How will I get my salary? Will the Central Bank fight inflation? These questions are major. People are trying to protect what they have saved. If we look at the market today as a whole, we'll see that there are very few mechanisms with which people can temporarily invest their savings: 80% are accounted for in bank deposits, some of them are accounted for in currencies, but people have generally taken the process of de-dollarization - in 1998 as well as in 2013 - rather calmly. There is another mechanism - through buying property, the only given document is a certificate of ownership and those who are able to still spend their money on real estate. The stock market for the majority is in fact unavailable. We have about 1 million citizens who own shares or are somehow involved in it. In comparison, in America more than 50 million people purchase shares, invest, try to earn something and so on,” Kazakovtsev says.



He thinks it is necessary for the Central Bank to adopt a more flexible policy. “Unfortunately, the policy carried out by the CB of revoking licenses is a relevant measure, but nevertheless every week licenses of regional banks are suspended. This creates an additional negative reaction among depositors. Not all the information reaches people. This all has its impact, and people are trying to purchase foreign currency. There is speculative demand. In 1998, for example, a threshold was introduced for commercial banks - 15%, that is, the addition to the currency price could not be higher than 15%. Now, when people come to the exchange office, they find out that either there is no currency or that some banks are trying to raise the price. As a result, the difference between the rate of the CB and the sale price in exchange offices is quite significant, which causes unexpected interest. I believe that today the Central Bank conducts audits and has resources. The issue is that, if there are doubts, let's make formal requests.”

Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People's Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP's Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the eurozone's 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long.###4519||The bike share is focused on increasing the number of weekly and daily users. Currently, weekly memberships are available for $25 and daily memberships are available for $9.95.

“It’s already kind of expensive as it is,” Todd Graham of Park Slope told CBS 2’s Janelle Burrell.

“I wouldn’t be surprised. $95 is not a lot of money for a bike to use all year long around the city whenever you want,” an annual member told Haskell. “Ninety-five dollars a year beats a MetroCard every month.”

Citi Bike Remains In The Red, Looks To Boost Daily, Weekly Ridership

The program currently currently has 99,000 annual members and an average daily ridership of more than 36,000 trips during the summer and fall.

But ridership took a worse-than-expected hit this winter, Burrell reported.

Operators are looking for more sponsors to provide a financial cushion. Citi Bike is looking at ways to attract more short-term users and expand into new neighborhoods.

According to reports, some Citi Bike workers have been laid off and there have also been operational problems.

Earlier this month, the New York City DOT Commissioner said all options are on the table when asked about a fee increase.

“A lot of people wont renew,” Kenneth Podziba, president and CEO of non-profit advocacy group Bike New York, told Burrell. “It’s just not working for tourists and I think people didn’t anticipate that when they made their projections.”

In other major cities like Chicago and Boston, where the bike-share programs are very successful, their annual membership is actually slightly less than what’s charged in New York. However, those bike-share programs are subsidized.

“There’s no public money. How else will it survive? You can’t rely on sponsors like Citibank and MasterCard to be there every year,” Podziba said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday cautioned the city is not in a position to bail out the bike-share program financially.

“Our transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, is gonna work with Citi Bike looking for ways that we can be in collaboration with them, find ways to make their operation more efficient, more effective,” said the mayor. “Our goal is to expand it farther out into the city and to the outer boroughs.”

Trottenberg added Friday that it’s her goal to get the service on sound financial and operational footing.

There are 6,000 Citi Bikes docked at 330 stations across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bike share program launched last May.

You May Also Be Interested In These Stories###4520||In the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Laura Kusisto, Eliot Brown and Andrew Tangel kick off a report on the challenges facing New York City’s rent-a-bike program with this gripping lead:

Leaders of Citi Bike are moving quickly to raise tens of millions of dollars to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money, according to people familiar with the matter.

Striking, but given the evidence in the rest of the piece, it has the air of a premature eulogy. Consider how the 10-month-old system has 100,000 annual members. Then there’s the truly terrible winter New York has experienced — Brooklyn data engineer Abe Stanway has proven that Citi Bike weather is indeed a thing — and the fact that the system at rollout had design flaws that seemed almost intended to make sure no one, in the early going, developed a habit of riding Citi Bike.

In other words, the Venn diagram overlap between “Citi Bike works” and “it’s not crazy to ride Citi Bike in this weather” has been awfully small.

For one thing, there was the botched software and hardware that made engaging with Citi Bike in the spring and summer enormously painful. In those days, it wasn’t unusual to try five different bike stations before finding one capable of producing a working bike. The slot for putting your blue key fob in was hidden like an Easter egg, and the software interface built by troubled Montreal-based operating company Bixi was terrible (and still isn’t terrific). Those design flaws caused several cities to withhold payment, and may have limited the capacity of the operating companies to improve the system.

Casual daily or weekly Citi Bike users had their own issues. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reports that while the number individual subscribers paying $95 a year has crept upward in the winter months, the number of short-term passes designed to appeal to tourists has dropped considerably.

Again, there’s the weather. But the system also hasn’t been optimized for use by tourists. Short-term passes work like this: The kiosk spits out a paper slip with a code that you carry over to the bike rack, which may or may not then release a bike. The process introduces tourists to an experience that many visitors to New York are eager to avoid: Standing in the middle of a sidewalk looking intensely foolish.

Perhaps the most enduring challenge for Citi Bike is where the Journal writes: “Finding additional sponsors has proved challenging because the program has become so closely associated with its eponymous supporter, according to a person familiar with the matter.”

“Closely associated” is an understatement. The Bloomberg administration went all in on mono-corporate sponsorship of its bike share program. The bikes are Citibank blue and branded with the company name on nearly every surface. MasterCard is also a Citi Bike sponsor, in particular for the payment system, but finding anyone who has ever referred to “Citi Bikes with the additional sponsorship of MasterCard” is probably next to impossible. That reality is no doubt discouraging to other would-be partners. It’s hard to say what the fix is, short of scrapping the program’s identity altogether.

We’re approaching the time when Citi Bike’s early adopters will decide whether to re-up their memberships, and that renewal rate will be telling. The system works better now and New York’s weather will soon hit its gorgeous phase. That seems a far truer test of the system’s prospects than these first 10 months have been.###4521||10.17.18 in Gadgetry

It's hard to be the king... err, I mean CEO.

Even if your company has a pretty spectacular year, where you finally figure out how to monetize, and the investing world rewards you handsomely for it, and then you cap it off with an historic purchase, your employees still might knock you off the top spot of beloved CEOs.

Poor Mark Zuckerberg. Last year he held the top spot on Glassdoor's list of the top 50 highest rated CEOs. Now the 2014 list was released out on Friday, and Zuck is no longer on top. He's not in the top five either. In fact, he's barely even in the top 10, falling all the way down to number nine.

His replacement as top CEO is LinkedIn's Jeff Weiner, the only one on the list to get a perfect 100% rating. (I have this vision in my head of Weiner coming up to Zuckerberg and saying, "Look at me. Look at me! I'm the captain now!" I'd give anything for that to actually happen!)

Funny enough, Weiner did not even have enough reviews to even qualify last year because he did not have enough ratings to qualifty.

These rankings are based purely on employee feedback, which was submitted from between February 1st, 2013 and January 31st 2014. At least 100 current and former employees need to have filled out surveys, hence why someone as beloved as Weiner may not make the list one year, and then top it the next.

With Weiner at number one, and Zuckerberg at number nine, who else from the tech world made the list?

Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm came in at number four, with a 95% approval rating. Last year he was down at number 8, with the same percentage. Apparently the list got a lot tougher in 2013!

Another top 10 CEO was Brad Smith of Intuit, making a big surge from number 23 on last year's list. Meanwhile, Google's Larry Page came in right behind Zuckerberg at number 10, moving up one spot from 2013.

Marc Benioff of Salesforce was given a 93% approval rating, good enough for number 12. He also moved up one spot from last year. Apple's Tim Cook went from number 18 to 17, while eBay's John Donahoe did not even make the list last year and found himself as the 19th most beloved CEO of 2013.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw a big tumble, going from 18th place, and a 93% approval rating in 2012, to 32nd place, and only 86% approval, for last year. I guess his employees hate the idea of drone delivery as much as the rest of us!

And finally, just squeaking by is Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, who only 79% of her employees like. Ouch! Sadly, Mayer is only one of two women, along with Victoria’s Secret CEO Sharen Turney, to be ranked. Last year only Turney made the list, so at least that's some progress, right? Right?

Some who made it onto last year's list, only to find themselves kicked off, are Dell CEO Michael S. Dell, Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata Consultansy Services and Krishnakumar Natarajan of Mindtree.

This is the fifth time that Glassdoor has put out the top CEO list, but there was a change made this year:the company has added a second list made up of f the top 25 CEOs leading small & mid-sized companies, meaning fewer than 1,000 employees.

Topping that list was Robert Reid of Intacct Corporation, followed by Anthony Bruce of Applied Predictive Technologies, Steve Beauchamp of Paylocity, Bill Davison of SirsiDynix and Chip Paucek of 2U.

“We find on Glassdoor that a strong leader is often one who has the ability to clearly communicate the vision for the company and who helps employees see how their work connects to the big picture. In addition, top rated CEOs are commonly seen as relatable, accessible and transparent,” Robert Hohman, Glassdoor CEO and co-founder, said in a statement to VatorNews.

“I offer my sincerest congratulations to all CEOs recognized on the 2014 Glassdoor report. It is no small feat to gain the support of your employees for your leadership.”

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously, they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It also will offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure because of a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.###4525||Empty###4526||Hello

Financial shares were lower in Friday's pre-market session, weighed by bank stocks, which edged slightly lower, even as the latest round of annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve released late Thursday showed 29 of the 30 largest banks have enough capital to withstand a severe economic downturn.

The only one of the 30 largest banks that didn't meet the Fed's minimum capital standards was Zions Bancorp ( ZION ), which had a Tier 1 common capital ratio under the stress test of 3.5%, below the Fed's minimum threshold of 5%.

Late Thursday, Zions said it will resubmit its capital plan to the Fed and anticipates the resubmission will contain additional actions that will further reduce risk and/or increase its common equity capital sufficient to pass the stress test.

ZION shares were down about 1.3% in pre-market trade Thursday.

In other financial stocks news, Western Asset Mortgage Capital ( WMC ) was 1.5% lower after it reported Q4 net income of $20.8 million, or $0.83 per share, compared with $24.82 million or $1.04 per share in the same period last year.

Core earnings (a non-GAAP measure) were $17.2 million, or $0.70 per share, compared with the prior-year period's $22.96 million, or $0.96 per share.

TOKYO, March 21 (Reuters) - Mt. Gox said on Friday it found 200,000 “forgotten” bitcoins on March 7, a week after the Tokyo-based digital currency exchange filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it lost nearly all the 850,000 bitcoins it held, worth some $500 million at today’s prices.

Mt. Gox made the announcement on its website. Online sleuths had noticed around 200,000 bitcoins moving through the crypto-currency exchange after the bankruptcy filing.

The exchange, headed by 28-year-old Frenchman Mark Karpeles, said the bitcoins were found in an old-format online wallet which it had thought no longer held any bitcoins, but which it checked again after its bankruptcy filing.

“On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC,” the statement said.

It added that it moved the 200,000 bitcoins from online to offline wallets on March 14-15 “for security reasons.” “These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels,” it noted.

Many of Mt. Gox’s 127,000 creditors, who feared they had lost their investments when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, are skeptical about what the exchange has said happened to the bitcoins it had. In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox also said $28 million was “missing” from its Japanese bank accounts.

BITCOIN TRACKING

On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago overseeing a class action against Mt. Gox revised a previous order, allowing some of the exchange’s bitcoin movements to be tracked.

“Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we’ve been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it “found” these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins,” Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters in emailed comments.

Edelson is representing Illinois resident Gregory Greene, who proposed the class action over what he claims is a massive fraud. Mt. Gox blamed the loss of 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own on hackers who attacked its software.

Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins is now about $7 billion. (Additional reporting by Tom Hals in DELAWARE; Editing by Ian Geoghegan and Miral Fahmy)###4529||Share

Starting on March 26, Walmart starts taking on GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, and a number of other retailers with a video game trade-in program, the company confirms. You’ll be able to sell off your old games at any of the more than 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a gift card for use online or in-store at any Walmart or Sam’s Club. This also means that Walmart’s getting into the used game sales business, with all re-sold discs sent off to be refurbished before being restocked on store shelves (or kept as inventory for online sales) at a lower price.

The program works just like others of this sort. You bring your game in its original packaging to the electronics department of one of the company’s stores. A customer service rep will inspect each disc for cracks and other defects and tells you what it’s all worth. Then you get your money, in the form of a gift card. Simple stuff.

The program builds on Walmart’s existing trade-in program, that allows customers to sell off old smartphones and tablets. You can find more info on the newly expanded trade-in program on Walmart’s official website.###4530||Empty###4531||Iowa’s unemployment rate went up slightly in January.

Specifically, economic strength.

The message was this: Whenever I decide to, I can pick up a pen, and kill a significant financial institution in your country.

Related: Does Putin Want to Carve Up Ukraine and Take the Spoils?

Obama’s victim was the St. Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya.

In response to Russia’s takeover of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, Obama yesterday authorized the Treasury Department to add 20 members of Putin’s inner circle, as well as Bank Rossiya, to the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s list of “specially designated nationals.”

The designation makes the individuals named ineligible to do business with U.S. financial institutions, which is likely a major personal inconvenience. But for Bank Rossiya, the designation is something like the kiss of death.



Bank Rossiya is not the largest bank in Russia by a long shot, but its significance lies in its clientele rather than its size. In announcing the sanctions, the Treasury Department noted that Bank Rossiya “is the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation” including members of the Ozero Dacha Cooperative, an exclusive community where members of Putin’s inner circle live. In addition, it provides financial services to the single largest segment of the Russian economy – the oil, gas, and energy sector.

Essentially, this is a credit union for oligarchs, with a side business in financing the Russian energy industry. Its customers include many more high-profile Russians than just those named in the Treasury statement. As of Thursday it is, for all intents and purposes, out of business.

If account holders want to do any kind of business at all short of paying their utility bills and using Russian ATMs, they are going to need to go elsewhere, said experts.

“They’ve got to go to another bank,” said Lester M. Joseph, former principal deputy chief of the Department of Justice’s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering section. “That bank is pretty much a pariah.”

Currently the international investigations manager at Wells Fargo Bank, Joseph said when heard about the sanctions on Bank Rossiya, the first thing he did was check to see if it was a customer of his institution. “It is not, thankfully,” he said.

The impact doesn’t stop there, Joseph explained. His next step, which is ongoing, is to see if any banks that Wells Fargo has relationships with are also doing business with Bank Rossiya, and to make sure that none of those banks are routing transactions from the Russian bank through Wells Fargo’s system. “If a transaction from that bank is coming from another bank, we would have to block it,” he said.

Related: IMF Now Divides Congress Over Support of Ukraine

Joseph said that every other bank in the U.S. is – or ought to be – doing exactly the same thing.

Considering the volume of international wire transfers that flow through the systems of U.S. banks, he said, this essentially shuts down Bank Rossiya’s access to a huge portion of the worldwide banking system.

As one U.S. official told Reuters, Bank Rossiya will be “frozen out of the dollar.”

And it only gets worse.

Even if governments in other countries don’t join the U.S. in sanctions against Bank Rossiya, their bankers will have a very strong incentive to stop doing business with the Russian bank if they have any ties at all to U.S. institutions – which virtually all significant international banks do.

Related: Russia’s Provocative New Act of Aggression in Ukraine

“If they are doing business with that bank, and they are also doing business in the United States, if something slips through,” then suddenly they’re facing U.S. regulatory action, said Robert Rowe, vice president and senior counsel for the American Bankers Association. International wire traffic is voluminous and largely automated, he said, making it easier for an international bank to simply stop doing business with Bank Rossiya rather than trying to route transactions associated with it away from the U.S.

Rowe said this would affect not only individuals who do their banking at Bank Rossiya, but perhaps more importantly, the oil and gas companies that arrange their trade financing through the bank.

“That’s where it’s going to have an impact,” said Rowe.

Banking experts said that one of the uncertainties surrounding yesterday’s move is how Russia will respond. The Russian government immediately released a widely mocked list of U.S. officials whom it said would be blocked from doing business in Russia.

Related: Confusion Reigns Over Path Forward in Crimea

Politicians named on the list rushed to Twitter to boast about being sanctioned and to leave sarcastic comments about being forced to forgo vacations in Siberia.

However, according to John Byrne, executive vice president of the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists – a trade group for bankers and law enforcement professionals who deal with issues including OFAC compliance – that’s likely not the end of it.

“There’s no question these sanctions are an appropriate and effective national security tool,

he said, “but this is a country that can fight back.”

How Russia reacts to the sanctions, Byrne said, will be closely watched by the financial community. And that reaction is by no means predictable. In general, major industrialized countries don’t try to shut down each other’s financial institutions without evidence of blatant illegal activity – which does not appear to exist in the case of Bank Rossiya.

“This is a new thing,” said Joseph. “It’s not a rogue bank. It’s a bank in a country where we do a lot of business. It’s not involved in a criminal case.” Compared to other actions by past administrations, he said, “It’s much more complex.”

Changes to this year’s stress test

Starting in 2009 with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the stress tests are something of a work in progress. Every year the conditions change (and hopefully improve) to give the government a better idea of how the financial system will hold up during the next financial crisis.

This year the Federal Reserve stopped depending on banks’ own balance sheet and risk-weighted asset growth projections, instead using independent estimates that should improve the consistency of the results. The stress tests were also expanded from the original 18 banks that have taken part since 2009 to include an additional 12 institutions with at least $50 billion in total assets.

The revised capital framework that was approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 was partially phased in during this round of stress tests, and eight institutions with the largest trading and custodial operations were also tested under a global trading shock scenario by estimating losses from their largest counterparty defaulting unexpectedly.

Adverse and severe adverse scenarios

The serious adverse scenario is meant to model a severe recession: a sharp rise in unemployment, equity markets down 50%, and housing prices down to 2001 levels lasting nine quarters. Under this scenario the 30 BHCs would have a combined $366 billion in loan losses, and the aggregate tier 1 common capital ratio would drop from an actual 11.5% to an estimated 7.6%. Considering that the actual tier 1 ratio was 5.5% when the first stress test was conducted in 2009, it’s clear how much progress the financial system has made adjusting to the new capital requirements. Most BHCs fall in the range from just under 6%, still an improvement over the 2009 average, to more than 13%, but Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION)’s has just 3.5% tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the severe adverse stress test.

Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION)’s was also the worst performer under the adverse scenario, which models a moderate recession, but the gap was less pronounced. Overall, the average tier 1 capital ratio falls from 11.5% to 9.7% under adverse conditions, giving some confidence that the financial system is better equipped to deal with unexpected shocks than it was before the last crisis.###4541||New model: The new one pound coin (Picture: HM Treasury/PA)

NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop’s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###4546||Good news for Indiana's unemployment rate.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Ottawa is acting against those "responsible for undermining Ukraine's sovereignty." The 14 individuals named Friday included Gennady Timchenko, a founder of Gunvor Group, one of the world's largest commodity-trading companies.

Canada's move came a day after the U.S. included Mr. Timchenko in a new round of economic sanctions against Russia for its takeover of Ukraine's Crimea.

Others on Ottawa's latest list for "economic sanctions and travel bans" include an aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin, senior government officials, and Yuri Valentinovich Kovalchuk, the single largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously, they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It also will offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure because of a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.###4550||It's a big day for the chancellor George Osborne. Not only has he got to deliver his budget, but the clever old chap has diverted headlines by announcing there'll be a new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit.

It is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Ooh.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

That's enough about the coin and it's 12 sides. We are more interested in the other sides to the chancellor, so here we go...###4551||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia | A satellite image released by China on Saturday offered the latest sign that wreckage from a Malaysia Airlines plane lost for more than two weeks could be in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean where planes and ships have been searching for three days.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia | A satellite image released by China on Saturday offered the latest sign that wreckage from a Malaysia Airlines plane lost for more than two weeks could be in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean where planes and ships have been searching for three days.



The image, showing an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet), was taken around noon Tuesday. The image location was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of where an Australian satellite viewed two objects two days earlier. The larger object was about as long as the one the Chinese satellite detected.



"The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify," Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday.



Australian officials said the location was within the 36,000-square-kilometer (14,000-square-mile) area they searched on Saturday, but the object was not found. Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman Andrea Hayward-Maher said she did not know whether the precise coordinates of the location had been searched, but added that coordinators will use the information to refine the search area.



The authority, which is overseeing the search in the region, said a civil aircraft reported seeing a number of small objects in the search area, including a wooden pallet, but a New Zealand military plane diverted to the location found only clumps of seaweed. The agency said in a statement that searchers would keep trying to determine whether the objects are related to the lost plane.



The latest satellite image is another clue in the baffling search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which dropped off air traffic control screens March 8 over the Gulf of Thailand with 239 people on board.



After about a week of confusion, Malaysian authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



The discovery of the two objects by the Australian satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to a stretch of the Indian Ocean about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Australia. But three days of searching have produced no confirmed signs of the plane.



One of the objects spotted in the earlier satellite imagery was described as 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). The Boeing 777-200 is about 64 meters (209 feet) long with a wingspan of 61 meters (199 feet) and a fuselage about 6.2 meters (20 feet) in diameter, according to Boeing's website.



In a statement on its website announcing China's find, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense did not explain why it took four days to release the information. But there was a similar delay in the release of the Australian satellite images because experts needed time to examine them.



Two military planes from China arrived Saturday in Perth to join Australian, New Zealand and U.S. aircraft in the search. Japanese planes will arrive Sunday and ships were in the area or on their way.



Even if both satellites detected the same object, it may be unrelated to the plane. One possibility is that it could have fallen off a cargo vessel.###4552||Welcome to FierceTechExec

It has caused an uproar among Turkish citizens, who are finding ways get around the ban, Turkey's own president, and now the White House.

The Obama administration condemned the ban in an emailed statement on Friday, stating that blocking Twitter undermines a citizen's "ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association," and "runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world."

Erdoğan said Thursday he wanted to "eradicate" Twitter, but the block seems to have backfired: Turks have sent 1.2 million tweets within the country since the block, using various circumvention tools — including IP addresses being spread via graffiti.

The White House statement, issued by Press Secretary Jay Carney, reveals that the U.S. government has "conveyed" serious concern over the situation.

"We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information," Carney wrote.

Erdoğan said on Thursday that he doesn't care what the international community says. The United States and Turkey have remained friendly in recent years, based on a personal rapport between President Obama and Erdoğan. But that relationship has strained in recent months, according to analysts, after disagreements on Egypt — Turkey backed ousted President Mohamed Morsi — and Syria, when the U.S. decided not to launch a military operation.

The full White House statement is below:

The United States is deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools. We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world. We have conveyed our serious concern to the Turkish government, urge Turkish authorities to respect the freedom of the press by permitting the independent and unfettered operation of media of all kinds, and support the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies.

UPDATE, 4.30 p.m. ET: The U.S. State Department echoed the White House in condemning the ban, with its own statement.

The United States supports freedom of expression in Turkey and opposes any action to encroach on the right to free speech. We urge the Turkish Government to unblock its citizens’ access to Twitter and ensure free access to all social media platforms. An independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies. Today's shutdown of Twitter is contrary to Turkey's own expressed desire to uphold the highest standards of democracy. We have conveyed our serious concern over this action to Turkish authorities.###4556||Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has led a massive US$280m Series D round in messaging app Tango, literally weeks after Facebook spent US$19bn to acquire WhatsApp.

The move shows the heat hasn’t gone out of mobile and social messaging just yet.

Alibaba is understood to have contributed US$215m to the round. The investment values the Silicon Valley start-up at around US$1bn.

So far, Tango has raised US$367m in funding from DFJ, Qualcomm and Yahoo! co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang.

Tango allows users to send free text messages, photos and video messages over their phones.

It also has something of its own social network in the making, where users can send updates and play games.

Tango has so far attracted more than 200m users, more than double its user base a year ago.

It is estimated that about 70m people log into the app on a weekly basis. Its users are typically aged between 25 and 45.

Vision of the founders

Tango was forged in 2009 by CEO Uri Raz and CTO Eric Setton, initially as a competitor to Apple’s FaceTime. However, it quickly realised it could provide an alternative by breaking beyond the confines of iOS and embracing Android, as well.

“We launched Tango in September 2009 out of the personal need to stay connected to our own families,” the founders wrote in their blog.

“It helped tremendously that both of us came from deep video technology backgrounds and had strong entrepreneurial spirits. But it was the emotional connection with family living in other parts of the world that inspired our mission here at Tango. Back then we felt that free online communication through texts, voice and video calls would remove barriers and change the world. The world agreed: we signed up our first million members in the first 10 days after launch.”

The platform has evolved to allow users to communicate around photos, music, voice and video messages, as well as video games.

It has even created its own SDK for developers to create Tango-powered games.

“While we’ve made progress on our mission to enable people to communicate, share and feel more connected, we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible. The opportunity for Tango goes well beyond just providing a messaging app for free communications. We see an even bigger opportunity – one where people can have access to free communication, social networking features and enjoyable content – all within a single platform.

“Over the past eight months, Tango has evolved. We’ve introduced a content platform that is now home to more than 30 games. We’ve introduced new social networking features that allow members to share updates or photos and to find new friends. And we’ve introduced social music sharing through integration with Spotify, which means members can now send each other songs.

“Quite honestly, the results have blown us away. We’re excited by the 2x increase in daily engagement since last July. And we love it that our members are huge fans of music and love to send hundreds of millions of songs to their friends through Tango. These changes are reflected in huge growth in registered users: over the last year we’ve doubled to more than 200m,” Raz and Setton said.###4557||Empty###4558||Empty###4559||Walmart’s new online tool could change the way people shop as well as how other retailers price their merchandise.

NEW YORK — The ‘‘Every Day Low Price’’ king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Walmart told the Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called ‘‘Savings Catcher’’ on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego, and Atlanta.

The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals, but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature is to do the legwork for customers.

Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here

The tool isn’t revolutionary. Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Walmart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart Store Inc.’s US discount division, said in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for ‘‘technological answers to saving them money and time.’’

Walmart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it is hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Walmart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread, and laundry detergent. But Walmart’s ‘‘every day low price’’ model is under attack by online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items for less. On top of that, the retailer’s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Walmart’s US discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health. The discounter has also seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Walmart has had a pricematching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Walmart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. By last summer, Walmart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets.###4560||Empty###4561||Empty###4562||The latest clue in the two-week search for a missing Malaysia Airlines jet comes from a French satellite, which has picked up images of what may be debris from the Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean.

In a statement Sunday, Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said the country had received images from French authorities “showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor.” Search efforts have been focused on this area, southwest of Perth, Australia, after both Chinese and Australian satellites picked up evidence of objects floating in the area in the past week, the Associated Press reports.

No evidence of the missing flight MH370 has been found, although searchers discovered a wooden pallet of the sort used when loading some airplanes. The airliner has been missing since March 8 after vanishing while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people, most of them Chinese nationals, on board.

Authorities say the search could be hampered Sunday by a tropical cyclone in the vicinity.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

“We know that WMT “invests in price” ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,” Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.###4569||• Fed cuts tapering by USD 10bn to USD 55bn

• Unemployment threshold rate of 6.5% jettisoned

• EURUSD relatively stable in FOMC aftermath

The first meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) with the new chairwoman, Janet Yellen, concluded yesterday. At 18:00 GMT the statement was released, together with updated economic projections, and at 18:30 GMT Yellen faced journalists in the press conference.

Monthly purchases decreased by USD 10 billion

The FOMC decided to continue tapering its monthly-asset purchases. Beginning from April, the monthly purchases will be lowered by USD 10 billion to USD 55 billion. The Fed has indicated for a while and many times that it will stop the asset purchases before the year is over, and that the aim is to decrease the purchases at every FOMC meeting by the same amount.

Unemployment threshold jettisoned

Since December 2012, the forward guidance has pledged that rates would remain low as long as inflation is at 2.5 percent or less and as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent. As the unemployment rate hit a low of 6.6 percent last January, the guidance was hardly relevant. The Fed knows very well that the low unemployment rate paints a rather optimistic view of the labour market. Participation rate remains historically low and the number of people working part-time jobs for economic reasons is high, so the economy is far from full employment, or levels where the employment would cause inflationary pressures.

Instead of presenting new quantitative thresholds, the Fed stated that it will weigh ‘wide range of information’. This is actually the same as having no forward guidance at all. While this move toward traditional qualitative guidance was expected, it also makes analysts’ work harder as now they will have to estimate the economic variables and the Fed’s interpretation of those variables.

Connecting the dots: rate hikes in 2015

Without any concrete guidance, analysts looked at the economic projections and noticed that the majority of the FOMC saw the Federal funds rate reaching one percent by the end of 2015. Yellen tried to belittle the dot chart’s importance and that economist’s should concentrate on the FOMC statement for guidance. As the statement said that rates would remain low for a “considerable time” after asset purchases end, Yellen answered that it would “probably mean” around six months. Tapering is planned to be complete by the end of 2014, so the expected time frame is pretty clear.

View: hawkish now, dovish later?

The initial reaction was that the FOMC was more hawkish than expected. The chart, which I bravely posted before the event, shows that EURUSD has for the past year tended to fall after the FOMC, as expectations of “monetary candy” have built up, but the Fed has not delivered. This is again quite a similar situation. The end result was pretty much what was expected, but the dot plot and the lack of concrete guidance have led to a deflation of those ballooned hopes. After a while, markets will begin concentrating on the lack of concrete guidance, and then hopes will begin building up again.

The next key event will be the European Central Bank’s meeting on April 4, and as the same chart shows, the ECB-days have often been followed by a surging EURUSD. That has been the story of the EURUSD for some time now grinding slowly higher, but at the same time oscillating between Fed-highs and ECB-lows. Should the EURUSD remain bearish until the ECB-meeting, a visit lower towards channel bottoms could be on the cards. Short-term, the pair is sitting at the major support level of 1.3820, the highs from last October and December, and could see a bounce to perhaps 1.3850 or so.

Reactions: bond yields, USD surged, while stock plummeted

The futures market prices the first 25bps rate hike to happen in September 2015. The ten-year Treasury note yields rose from pre-FOMC 2.67 percent to a high of 2.792 percent. The bond yield has been trading in a range between 2.6 and roughly 2.8 percent since the beginning of February, and sooner or later could make another attempt toward the 3 percent-highs seen last December. EURUSD fell from 1.3920 to 1.3850-levels following the publication of the statement, and as Yellen’s press conference begun, the pair begun grinding lower hitting a low of 1.3810.

“The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,” he told a news conference.

No wreckage has been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8, less than an hour after taking off.

Malaysia has now made available to the FBI electronic data generated by both pilots of Flight MH370, including data from a hard drive attached to the captain’s flight simulator, and from electronic media used by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters.

The official said he could not confirm that some data had been wiped from the simulator and stressed that there was no guarantee the FBI analysis would turn up any fresh clues.

U.S. investigators had become increasingly frustrated in recent days that Malaysian authorities had not asked them for more help.

The FBI has extensive experience investigating airplane crashes, including those of TWA 800 and EgyptAir 990 off the U.S. East Coast in the 1990s and Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

In the case of EgyptAir 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot, while in the case of Pan Am 103, the agency worked with British and U.S. intelligence to build a case against the government of Libya.

In Kuala Lumpur, at the headquarters of a search operation that has so far turned up few leads, Chinese relatives’ anger over sparse information on the fate of their relatives sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday.

Malaysia’s transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency.

“They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don’t know how long we have to wait,” cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum.

Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish.

“Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,” he said in a statement.

Dwindling hopes

Prospects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north.

“Our top priority is being given to that area,” Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.

It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 230,000 square miles roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.

The unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER had focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia’s Sumatra island to west of Australia.

“The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,” said a source close to the investigation.

That view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.

Some sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could stall due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took.

Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.

“These are basically spy planes; that’s what they were designed for,” said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters.

Hishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance.

“The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,” he told the news conference, held in aKuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations.

Deliberately diverted

Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.

If the plane did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.

Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital data links: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.

U.S. agencies have looked for evidence that anyone other than the pilots knew how disable ACARS but have found nothing.###4571||Twitter has been largely shut down in Turkey, just hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “wipe out” the social network which, along with others, was highlighting corruption allegations against his inner circle.

The state-run Anatolia news agency said authorities “technically blocked access to Twitter” late Thursday because the service had ignored various Turkish court orders to remove some links deemed illegal.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content. “Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

Twitter, mwitter! We will wipe out all of these. This has nothing to do with freedoms

RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN

Twitter responded by saying on its official policy feed that Turks could get around the block by tweeting through mobile telephone text services.

In early reaction, the EU commissioner for digital agenda, Neelie Kroes, tweeted that the block in Turkey “is groundless, pointless, cowardly”. She added that the “Turkish people and international community will see this as censorship. It is.”

The restriction of access to Twitter came after Erdogan told a rally drumming up support for March 30 local elections that he would eradicate Twitter access in the country.

“We will wipe out Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says,” he said.

Erdogan’s office said in a statement that Twitter had remained “indifferent” to Turkish court rulings demanding “some links” be removed, and that the premier therefore had turned his attention to the matter.

The website for the country’s telecommunications authority (TIB) turned up four separate court rulings referencing “twitter.com”. One of them said: “The protection measure has been taken for this website (twitter.com) according to the decision ... of the Istanbul chief public prosecutor’s office and has been implemented by the TIB.”

Anatolia ran a report saying a Twitter block was the only solution to “address the unjust treatment of our citizens”.

Erdogan, Turkey’s charismatic and increasingly autocratic leader since 2003, has come under mounting pressure since audio recordings spread across social media that appeared to put him at the heart of a major corruption scandal.

Recordings include an apparent discussion between Erdogan and his son about hiding money, as well as and others in which he seems to be interfering in business deals, court cases and the media’s coverage.

Some of the most damaging information has come from a Twitter account, under the name Haramzadeler (“Sons of Thieves”), which appears to have access to a huge trove of secret documents and police wiretaps linked to the investigation.

Erdogan has dismissed most of the recordings as “vile” fakes concocted by his rivals, and threatened to ban YouTube and Facebook after crucial local elections on March 30. “Twitter, mwitter!,” Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.

“We will wipe out all of these. This has nothing to do with freedoms. Freedom does not mean the right to intrude on someone’s privacy, or to pass the state’s secrets to the international arena.”

The prime minister is openly suspicious of the internet and last year called Twitter a “menace” for helping organise mass anti-government protests.

A vast corruption inquiry launched in December saw dozens of people rounded up, including close business and political allies of the prime minister.

The Turkish strongman has accused associates of a former staunch ally – US-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States – of being behind the graft probe that claimed the scalps of four ministers. Gulen has denied any involvement in the matter.

Turkey recently tightened government control of the internet and the judiciary, generating criticism from rights groups.

The country, which has more than 10 million Twitter users, has seen access to thousands of sites blocked in recent years. YouTube was banned for two years up to 2010 because of material deemed insulting to the country’s revered founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

The Internet Publishers Association, a body representing online and media companies, said the move to block Twitter was an attempt to “destroy freedom of expression”.###4572||Empty###4573||Visa and MasterCard stopped processing transactions for holders of cards, issued by Russia's bank Rossiya, the bank said.

The bank is allegedly closed to the Kremlin regime and is subjected to international sanctions over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.



The news signalled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia.



Earlier sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials.



Sobinbank, part of the Rossiya banking group, said, quoted by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, that its call centers had been swamped by customers who were abroad and suddenly found their cards were not working.



Also affected was the Russian SMP Bank, majority owned by brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who were named as individuals in the US sanctions list.



“All other operations, including the issuance of deposits and making payments remain unaffected and without any restrictions,” SMP Bank said in a statement, adding that it has no assets in the United States.###4574||Tech Stocks New Lows: China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), Liquid Holdings Group Inc.

John Hickenlooper (D) Monday, closes a loophole in the state's marijuana laws, extending the same packaging requirements to medical marijuana products that already exist for recreational ones.

Under the new law, edible marijuana products sold to medical marijuana patients must be in opaque, child-proof packaging. The law also allows marijuana businesses to confiscate fake IDs from minors, just as liquor stores do, and requires that marijuana grown in a home with minors must be enclosed and locked.

Advocates of the law, which included the marijuana industry, say it is an important clarification that will help keep legal marijuana from getting into the hands of minors. "Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Governor Hickenlooper, before signing the bill.

But there is still disagreement about whether the regulations go far enough. In particular, the popular niche of marijuana "edibles" – candy, cookies, gummy bears, lollipops – has been controversial, since skeptics say it can be too easy for someone to confuse the products with their non-pot-infused counterparts, or to ingest higher quantities of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, than they intend. There have also been concerns about the accuracy of testing and labeling, particularly when it comes to the potency of such products.

The new packaging requirements "are a step in the right direction," says Rachel O'Bryan, an attorney and member of Smart Colorado, a group pushing for tighter regulation. "But the underlying product in the packaging can still be confused with real food. The second you take it out of that packaging, you don't know if the product is a gummy bear or a" marijuana-infused product.

Ms. O'Bryan cites the incident in a Westminster, Colo., middle school last week in which a student brought marijuana candies to school and shared them with friends, some of whom said they didn't know the candy contained marijuana. In another incident, reported in Steamboat Springs last week, an 18-year-old man cleaning a condo apparently ate a candy bar left behind by the renters without realizing it was infused with marijuana. He went to the hospital and was treated for an overdose.

In the middle school incident, at least 15 students were involved, according to police and three have been arrested. Several more are facing suspensions. But O'Bryan says that she would prefer to see punishment of the adults – who presumably purchased the candy and made it accessible – than the students.

"We would like to see both messaging to Colorado parents, as well as strict enforcement of laws that when an adult gives marijuana to a child they are going to be held accountable," she says.

Her group would also like to see tighter regulations on the amount of marijuana concentrates that can be sold. Buying an ounce of pure THC, as is currently allowed, says O'Bryan, can be the equivalent of roughly 2,800 servings and yet could fit into a shampoo bottle. "That's concerning to us when the No. 1 [federal] priority is keeping it out of hands of minors."

Such concerns have some validity, says Michael Elliott, executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, but in most cases he doesn't think new laws are necessary. The packaging law was an appropriate way to close a loophole, Mr. Elliott says, but the Department of Revenue can look into limits on concentrates and can set rules.

"We have a very good process in place, and the Department of Revenue is doing a tremendous job in a very difficult environment," says Elliott.

Concerns have been raised, too, about the accuracy of testing and the ability of labs to handle the state's needs. Starting May 1, all edibles that are sold from a recreational pot business must have been tested for potency. And by Oct. 1, all marijuana products will need to be tested both for potency and contaminants.

The Denver Post has raised questions about the accuracy of some of the testing. And Elliott says there are concerns about whether there will be enough labs to meet the demand. Currently there are three licensed facilities, and three more on the way.

"It’s a huge testing burden," says Elliott.

Since recreational sales became legal in Colorado on Jan. 1, the state has been under tremendous scrutiny. But while there have been some anecdotal incidents of increased emergency room visits and minors accessing pot, there isn't much data.

Elliott says that the lack of incidents should be viewed as a success.

"All the public safety nightmares people said were going to happen, none of them materialized," Elliott says, noting that both traffic fatalities and teen marijuana use both went down in the past few years. Unlike the black-market system through which marijuana is readily available in the rest of the world, he adds, "we now have a system of accountability and transparency."

The biggest safety concern that Elliott and marijuana industry members still have, he says, is that marijuana businesses, no matter how big, can't use banks. They are forced to deal almost exclusively in cash – a situation that could make them attractive targets for criminals.

Critics of legalization say it's far too soon to count Colorado as a success.

Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), a national group that opposes legalization, has started a new website, legalizationviolations.org, that tracks some kinds of incidents in Colorado and Washington State, which has also legalized recreational marijuana. Recent posts speak of Colorado pot crossing into Nebraska and Wyoming and teenagers using vaporizers – a sort of e-cigarette – to discreetly smoke pot in class, since there's no smell or smoke.

"Any steps to reduce access to kids and make it less likely kids will use marijuana is laudable, but I think will ultimately be unsuccessful in the framework of legalization," says Kevin Sabet, the cofounder of Project SAM and director of the Drug Policy Institute at the University of Florida. "Because legalization by definition is the commercialization of marijuana and companies only make money off heavy users, they have to target young people as part of a successful business model."###4576||In the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Laura Kusisto, Eliot Brown and Andrew Tangel kick off a report on the challenges facing New York City’s rent-a-bike program with this gripping lead:

Leaders of Citi Bike are moving quickly to raise tens of millions of dollars to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money, according to people familiar with the matter.

Striking, but given the evidence in the rest of the piece, it has the air of a premature eulogy. Consider how the 10-month-old system has 100,000 annual members. Then there’s the truly terrible winter New York has experienced — Brooklyn data engineer Abe Stanway has proven that Citi Bike weather is indeed a thing — and the fact that the system at rollout had design flaws that seemed almost intended to make sure no one, in the early going, developed a habit of riding Citi Bike.

In other words, the Venn diagram overlap between “Citi Bike works” and “it’s not crazy to ride Citi Bike in this weather” has been awfully small.

For one thing, there was the botched software and hardware that made engaging with Citi Bike in the spring and summer enormously painful. In those days, it wasn’t unusual to try five different bike stations before finding one capable of producing a working bike. The slot for putting your blue key fob in was hidden like an Easter egg, and the software interface built by troubled Montreal-based operating company Bixi was terrible (and still isn’t terrific). Those design flaws caused several cities to withhold payment, and may have limited the capacity of the operating companies to improve the system.

Casual daily or weekly Citi Bike users had their own issues. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reports that while the number individual subscribers paying $95 a year has crept upward in the winter months, the number of short-term passes designed to appeal to tourists has dropped considerably.

Again, there’s the weather. But the system also hasn’t been optimized for use by tourists. Short-term passes work like this: The kiosk spits out a paper slip with a code that you carry over to the bike rack, which may or may not then release a bike. The process introduces tourists to an experience that many visitors to New York are eager to avoid: Standing in the middle of a sidewalk looking intensely foolish.

Perhaps the most enduring challenge for Citi Bike is where the Journal writes: “Finding additional sponsors has proved challenging because the program has become so closely associated with its eponymous supporter, according to a person familiar with the matter.”

“Closely associated” is an understatement. The Bloomberg administration went all in on mono-corporate sponsorship of its bike share program. The bikes are Citibank blue and branded with the company name on nearly every surface. MasterCard is also a Citi Bike sponsor, in particular for the payment system, but finding anyone who has ever referred to “Citi Bikes with the additional sponsorship of MasterCard” is probably next to impossible. That reality is no doubt discouraging to other would-be partners. It’s hard to say what the fix is, short of scrapping the program’s identity altogether.

We’re approaching the time when Citi Bike’s early adopters will decide whether to re-up their memberships, and that renewal rate will be telling. The system works better now and New York’s weather will soon hit its gorgeous phase. That seems a far truer test of the system’s prospects than these first 10 months have been.###4577||Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service.

So far, Bank Rossiya is the only company to be named in the US sanctions list, described by Washington as 'the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation'.

Visa and MasterCard have suspended payment processing services to its clients while Russia's central bank has countered that, if needs be, it will take appropriate measures to protect the interests of Bank Rossiya's depositors and creditors.

Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, part owned by Gennady Timchenko, one of Russia's leading businesmen, today fell by 8 per cent. Gunvor, the fourth-largest oil trader co-founded by Timchenko, is also at the centre of a debate about whether Putin, who is an investor, could commandeer its funds.

The sanctions prompted companies with links to Russia and Ukraine to take hasty action to protect themselves from sanctions particularly regarding their contractual entitlement to suspend their contracts.

Yet despite these dramatic troubles, big investment banks are playing down the impact of a new cold war on the medium-term economy. Hakan Enoksson, head of fixed interest at RBC Wealth Management, told Interactive Investor that the wealth manager's essential view on the economic outlook for European countries had not changed, although the firm has sold out of major Russian corporates such as state-owned energy company Gazprom, which is still at the centre of intense negotiations about the $2 billion (£1.2 billion) owed to it by Kiev.

Barclays also issued a report today which identified a hard landing in China as the biggest risk to derail the global recovery, and largely limits its concern about Russia's oil output, coming at a time when key producers in the Middle East and Africa face serious political and security challenges that are imperilling output.

Fears not unfounded

On China, it said: 'Such fears are not entirely unfounded in the medium term, as it will be very difficult for authorities to restructure the economy toward a more sustainable growth model and enact needed market reforms while at the same time maintaining strong growth and avoiding accidents such as the bursting of a property bubble.

'But so far Chinese policymakers have demonstrated a willingness to put aside their medium-term restructuring goals and employ policy tools such as easier credit and infrastructure spending to avoid any sharp slowdown from becoming sustained.

'Indeed, these measures are already being employed, suggesting to us that the next move in Chinese growth is up.'

On Russia, Barclays notes that while there has been no cut-off of Russian energy supplies through the Ukraine pipeline network to date, such a course of action cannot be ruled out if the crisis escalates, and that the crisis will also jeopardize much-needed long-term Western investment in the Russian energy sector. It will also impact the scope of the nuclear capabilities that Iran will be allowed to retain permanently.

Equity and fixed-income balance

Otherwise, the research highlights the benign 'environment of low inflation, modest growth and very supportive monetary policy [which] is likely to persist over the next several months', adding that with few credible alternatives in fixed income, 'it would be tempting for investors to overload their portfolios with stocks'.

Instead the bank recommends a balance between equities and fixed income on the basis that bonds will be an effective hedge to stockmarket correction.

'We have not seen a bona fide correction for nearly two years and investors have become optimistic, lowering the bar for disappointment,' it said.

'More broadly, stockmarkets have been going up in developed markets even as medium-term growth prospects have been falling due to structural factors such as slower growth in working age populations and higher dependency ratios.

'Unusually supportive monetary policy seems to be boosting financial asset prices more than economic growth, providing a reason to maintain strong positions in stocks in the near term, but hardly comforting in the medium term.'

Sarasin & Partners amongst others have suggested that a bigger risk to the global economy is the Japanese/Chinese row and posturing over five small islands in the Pacific Ocean, known as the Senkaku Islands by the Japanese and the Diaoyu Islands by the Chinese.

China has been building a big navy presence around the islands.###4580||What’s motivating Torontonians to vote — or not — on Oct. 22 (and it’s not the ward fiasco)

* Focus on Putin speech later in session

* U.S. CPI, housing-related data awaited

By Shinichi Saoshiro

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen was on the defensive and the euro stood firm in early trade on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 101.88 yen, pulling further away from a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday, helped by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields as safety demand for government debt receded. Bond yields fall as prices rise.

The euro stood at $1.3927, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

After Sunday’s referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

“In immediate focus is Russian president Putin’s speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

“But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving U.S. government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar,” he said.

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia’s State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow’s involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia’s armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8734, pulling further away from a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8696 hit last week as investor risk aversion ebbed for the moment.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, was at 79.376, edging up from a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the U.S. consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar’s likely direction.###4582||You are using an older browser version.

Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

The letter, dated Thursday, was signed by Reps. Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a "breakthrough" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that "a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it."

Due to Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado's and Pennsylvania's Medicaid programs had already announced that they're funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California's is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is "encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi."

Meanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.

Health insurer WellPoint (WLP) chimed in Friday with concerns about new hepatitis C drug costs, said executive Ken Goulet.

Biotech Stocks Cheaper

Gilead's (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), whose sole drug, Soliris, goes for upward of $400,000 a year, tumbled 8%. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which also sells an expensive hepatitis C drug called Incivek, retreated 5%.

Biogen Idec (BIIB), which has a costly multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, lost 8%.

IBD's top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 4.5%.

AbbVie (ABBV), which will likely come out with a rival and possibly cheaper rival to Sovaldi later this year, initially rallied Friday, but closed down a fraction.

"It's like Gilead caught a cold and the rest of the market caught pneumonia," said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Opportunity Fund .

Sovaldi A Bargain?

Analysts, for the most part, advised staying calm. Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that "pricing discussions could generate headline 'concern,' but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they're curing patients and improving society. ... HCV is an important public health issue (like HIV was) and validates the significance of this market."

Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a client note that she'd spoken to Gilead officials and they were already making their case that Sovaldi is actually a bargain.

"A liver transplant related to HCV costs up to $250,000 and another $50,000 each year for meds so that the person does not reject the liver," she wrote. "Gilead has co-pay programs in place (in which) the out-of-pocket cost is as low as $5."

ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex's Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year. Sovaldi's cure rate is also much higher than Incivek's, so the cost "per cure" is even better, he said in a webinar Friday.

Dems Seek 'Public Shaming'

Schoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a "public shaming" not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.

"This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi," Haines wrote.

Such a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a large nonprofit with a history of criticizing Gilead over its HIV drug pricing, recently turned its fire on Sovaldi.

"Gilead's latest display of out-of-touch greed comes on the heels of the company's January pricing its new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), at $1,000 per pill ... 1,100% more than Gilead's most expensive AIDS drug, Stribild," the AHF said in a Feb. 4 press release.

All this has played out as biotech stocks have hit a lull the last few weeks, after a bull run not seen since the 1990s, leading some to fear that the party may be over. Vandeventer says that while biotechs are a "high beta group," this is probably just a correction. After all, he points out, drug prices have been a political football since the early 1990s.

"It shouldn't be completely unexpected that these kinds of issues come to the fore periodically," he said. "It's just part of investing in health care."###4587||You are the owner of this article.###4588||A Kansas agency says the state's jobless rate dipped to 4.8 percent in January and more people held jobs than at the beginning of 2013.

By Nate Raymond and Silke Koltrowitz

NEW YORK/ZURICH, March 21 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay $885 million to resolve claims by a U.S. regulator that the Swiss bank misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.

The settlement announced on Friday would resolve claims in two lawsuits filed in New York by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies.

It is the ninth settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011, when it filed 18 lawsuits over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

The accord resolves claims pending in New York federal court against Credit Suisse over $16.6 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and ends what the Swiss bank called the largest mortgage-related investor litigation it still faced.

Credit Suisse will pay $234 million to Fannie Mae and $651 million to Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.

So far, the FHFA has recovered more than $10.1 billion from banks over similar securities.

This includes nearly $9.8 billion in settlements of litigation with such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The FHFA also reached a separate $335.2 million accord with Wells Fargo & Co, which it did not formally sue.

Many of the settlements were reached after a series of series of court rulings that went against the banks.

Lawsuits remain pending against several other banks, including Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

Credit Suisse said on Friday it will reduce previously reported fourth-quarter and 2013 results by 275 million Swiss francs ($311.17 million) after taxes for the settlement, resulting in a fourth-quarter net loss of 8 million Swiss francs.

While Credit Suisse said the settlement resolves the biggest mortgage case it faced, the bank still must deal with other mortgage cases in the United States, including ones by the National Credit Union Administration and attorneys general in New York and New Jersey.

Credit Suisse is also one of 14 Swiss banks targeted by U.S. prosecutors for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank has said it is trying to settle that matter.

Last month, the Zurich-based bank agreed to pay $196.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it provided unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients.

The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v.

The Morning Glory tanker was due to arrive later on Saturday at Libya's government-controlled Zawiya port after being seized by U.S. commandos and escorted back through international waters by the U.S. Navy, Libyan officials said.

Hours before the handover, at least 16 people were wounded when Libyan rebels occupying three eastern oil ports clashed with troops and attacked an army base, where pro-government forces had been preparing to break the rebel blockade.

Anti-aircraft gunfire and explosions were heard overnight and after dawn on Saturday in Ajdabiya, the hometown of rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran, whose fighters seized the ports last summer to demand a greater share in Libya's oil resources.

The struggle for control of Libya's vital petroleum resources is one of the key challenges facing the weak central government, which has still failed to secure the North African country three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.

Brigades of former anti-Gaddafi rebels and militias refuse to disarm and often use armed force or control of oil facilities to make demands on a state whose army is still in training.

U.S. special forces boarded and seized the Morning Glory tanker last Sunday off Cyprus, days after it left Libya with a cargo of crude from one port, Es Sider, occupied by Jathran's men who had vowed to export oil themselves to resist Tripoli.

"The handover took place in international waters off the coast of Libya, and the Government of Libya and its security forces are now in control of the vessel," the U.S. embassy said in a statement.

Once the Morning Glory docks, crude from the tanker will be fed into Zawiya refinery, which has been forced to lower its production because of a protest at another oil facility, the El Sharara oilfield, officials at Zawiya port said.

Zawiya port is 55 km (34 miles) west of the capital Tripoli.

The Tripoli government gave Jathran a two-week deadline on March 12 to end his port blockade or face a military assault, though analysts say Libya's nascent armed forces may struggle to carry out that threat.

Jathran's self-declared Cyrenaica government is demanding more autonomy for his eastern region. Attempts to broker a deal between the rebels and Tripoli have so far failed.

LANA state news agency said tribal community leaders helped stop the fighting earlier on Saturday between the rebels and Libyan soldiers. But the agency reported 16 people were wounded.

SPLITS, RIVALRIES

After months of threats, Jathran's federalist gunmen managed to load crude onto the Morning Glory tanker. The ship left port and escaped Libya's navy, embarrassing Tripoli's government and prompting parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

The seizure of the tanker in international waters was a rare boost for the government, which has struggled to end a standoff that has cost the state more than $7 billion in lost revenue.

The three rebel-held ports account for around 700,000 barrels per day of Libya's oil export capacity, or around half of its total petroleum shipments.

The town where Saturday's battle broke out, Ajdabiya, is divided between Jathran supporters and those who fear his oil blockade will lead to the collapse of the state.

But any major assault on the three ports may bolster support for Jathran's cause for a federalist state.

Tripoli's government is also stymied by infighting among Islamists, secular parties and tribes that has delayed Libya's transition to democracy since the fall of Gaddafi, whose one-man rule left few state institutions.

Western governments, which backed NATO's air strikes to help the 2011 anti-Gaddafi revolt, are training Libya's armed forces and are pressing the factions to reach a political settlement.

(Writing by Patrick Markey; Editing by Gareth Jones)###4594||NEW YORK (AP) — Sally Beauty says that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

The seller of beauty supplies is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm. It is also working with the U.S. Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Sally Beauty Holdings Inc., which is based in Denton, Texas, said Monday that it will provide more information on its website in coming days, including notification of affected consumers and others.

A spate of major data breaches in recent months has raised awareness about the vulnerability of cards used in the U.S.

Recent intrusions include those at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus. The Target breach compromised 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of up to 70 million customers. At Neiman Marcus, its breach may have compromised 1.1 million debit and credit cards.

Security experts have been long pushed for increased consumer protection through so-called EMV enabled credit and debit cards, which are already common in Europe. Most cards in the U.S. still feature magnetic strips.

Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard, which seek broader acceptance of EMV technology from retailers and ATMs, said that they are creating a group intended to help the retail and banking industries come together on more-secure credit card payments. Visa and MasterCard, which run the networks that carry the payments, said the group’s initial focus will be on chips embedded in newer credit cards that make them more secure.

The Los Angeles City Attorney’s office announced March 14 it filed a lawsuit against Time Warner seeking nearly $10 million.

According to a statement released by City Attorney Mike Feuer, Time Warner has allegedly refused to pay fees to the municipality despite “raking in billions of dollars of revenue.”

“The City of Los Angeles enabled Time Warner to make billions and in turn they shortchanged the taxpayers millions,” Feuer stated.

ADVERTISEMENT

Specifically, the lawsuit seeks $9,697,896 from Time Warner, including more than $2.5 million in fees owed for 2008 and 2009, plus nearly $7.2 million for 2010 and 2011.

The money allegedly owed is for franchise Public, Educational, and Government (PEG) fees.

“Time Warner Cable … has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the City of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the City of Los Angeles … fully for this privilege,” the opening salvo of the 24-page complaint alleges.

City attorneys made two contentions to support its allegations against Time Warner.

“Time Warner enjoys a virtual monopoly for the provision of cable television services to the residents of the City, and it has blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the City resulting from the grant of that effective monopoly,” the complaint asserted.

The funds City Hall alleges have not been paid by Time Warner could have been used to pay for “core services,” such as fire and police protection, sanitation services, and operation of libraries, parks, and senior centers, the complaint continued.

Since 1986, City Hall has authorized “local cable franchises” divided into geographic segments within city limits.

“The Cable Act (and California law) permitted the City to require an operator to assume certain obligations in return for the non-exclusive right to occupy valuable public property – the rights-of-way – to build a system to provide cable,” the complaint stated.

In exchange for the “right to occupy valuable public property,” City Hall was authorized under the Cable Act (also known as the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984) to collect a franchise fee equal to five percent of the operator’s gross revenues.

The Act also allowed a city could enforce requirements for PEG facilities and equipment.

City Hall issued 12 local franchises to Time Warner, according to the complaint.

The complaint details City Hall’s relationship with Time Warner and how that relationship may have changed in light of new state legislation and a law enforcement action filed in 2008 by Los Angeles against the cable provided and alleging deceptive, fraudulent, and unfair practices.

Mike Dundas, a deputy city attorney, will oversee the litigation.###4596||Empty###4597||The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching on their tablets and smartphones for the lowest prices while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals -- but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store's U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for "technological answers to saving them money and time."

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's "every day low price" model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs onto the Savings Catcher page on www.walmart.com/ and types in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data show that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.

"They're doing the work for me," said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. "The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away."###4598||Top Company Interviews

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.###4602||A new Iowa Workforce Development report shows unemployment increased slightly in January over December.

The rate was 4.3 percent in January compared to 4.2 percent in December.

The rate was 5.0 percent last January. The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent -- the lowest national rate since October 2008.

"Despite a slight increase in the January unemployment rate, Iowa's unemployment conditions have improved substantially from one year ago," said Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development in a news release issued Monday. "The state's annual average unemployment rate for 2013 dropped to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2012. Iowa had the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation in 2013."

INDEPTH LOOK AT STATS:

Iowa nonfarm employment decreased by 7,300 jobs in January, lowering the total to 1,536,900. The monthly drop was dominated by larger-than-expected service sector layoffs in trade and transportation, as seasonal workers were laid off. In the goods-producing sector, construction also contributed to the loss.



Government was down 800 jobs in local and federal government, outweighing the gains in state government. Nonfarm employment has steadily trended upward despite the recent weakness, and is currently 19,500 jobs higher than one year ago (+1.3 percent).

Professional and business services added the most jobs in January (+1,600), partly due to early seasonal hiring in accounting and tax specialty firms. This monthly gain more than offset the slight loss in temporary help services. Financial activities added 900 jobs to offset smaller losses over the last few months. This sector has been resilient in Iowa, and is 900 jobs higher than a year ago and also at an all-time high.



Alternatively, retail trade accounted for over half of the jobs lost this month (-4,500), which was largely due to retail stores reducing their staff to pre-holiday levels. Transportation and warehousing industries also dropped employment (900), reflecting the seasonal layoffs of package delivery couriers. The construction sector pared jobs for the second month in a row (-2,600). However, the outlook for this sector is bright with the demand for new residential housing and commercial buildings on the rise.

Compared to last January, nonfarm employment has added 19,500 jobs. As a result of the annual benchmark revision, manufacturing is once again leading all sectors in year-over-year gains (+4,100). Education and health services followed closely behind (+4,000), and professional and business services ranked in third place (+3,900). Information services has been on a downward trend for the past decade, and trails last year’s level by 800 jobs. Construction is down a slight 400 jobs from one year ago.

Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.80% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -1.41% to Workday WDAY, -1.85% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, +0.42% or even Apple AAPL, +1.73% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

© 2014, The New York Times News Service

The night sky was clear above the clouds, and the last glimmer of a setting half-moon had faded when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, cruising at 35,000 feet over the Gulf of Thailand, approached the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace on its usual route to Beijing. What happened next should have been routine for a twice-daily milk run between two of Asia's most important cities. Air traffic controllers outside Kuala Lumpur usually hand the jet off to their counterparts in Ho Chi Minh City as the flight turns northeast toward the Chinese capital.But in those early hours of March 8, pilots flying nearby heard an unusual crescendo of chatter on the radio frequencies used by radar control in Vietnam and Malaysia. Air traffic personnel in both countries were trying and failing to reach the plane."Any stations in contact with Malaysian 370, please relay."Vietnamese and Malaysian controllers asked one aircraft after another to radio the jet. Pilots listened as one plane after another tried and heard only static."Malaysian 370, this is Malaysian 88.""Malaysian 370, this is Malaysian 52."People familiar with the calls, describing them for the first time, said they were calm, even laconic. The pilots trying to reach the airliner had no reason to believe it had suffered anything more than an ordinary radio malfunction. But those initial attempts to find a plane in the skies would soon evolve into an urgent multinational search operation spanning land and sea in two hemispheres. They signaled the start of what has become perhaps the most perplexing case in modern aviation - one that investigators say may take years to solve, or could remain a mystery forever.More than two weeks after Flight 370 disappeared, unbridled speculation surrounds the unfolding global drama. So much is uncertain about what happened on the plane, and so much of what has been disclosed by Malaysian authorities has been contradicted, that hardly any theory of its fate can be easily dismissed. On Saturday, the authorities said a Chinese satellite had made a new sighting of a possible object floating in the southern Indian Ocean in the area that is now the focus of the search, and China was sending ships to investigate.Based on dozens of interviews with people whose lives were touched by the plane as well as with outside experts and investigators from the two dozen countries searching for answers, this report presents a portrait of Flight 370 and the search to find it using what is known to date. But by necessity, it is an incomplete picture.Malaysia Airlines flies from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing twice daily, nonstop. The red-eye, departing at 12:35 a.m. and landing at 6:30 a.m., can carry a hodgepodge of travelers: vacationing Malaysian families, European businessmen pursuing deals, Chinese tourists returning home after visiting relatives or shopping.Passengers are advised to arrive at least two hours in advance. On March 7, a delegation of 34 Chinese artists, relatives and organizers who had spent the past several days participating in an art exhibit in Kuala Lumpur played it safe with the city's unpredictable Friday night traffic and arrived about 8 p.m.Perhaps the most prominent of the artists was the flight's oldest passenger, Liu Rusheng, 77, a calligrapher who had published an essay about how much he treasured life because he had "cheated death" six times, beginning when he was abandoned temporarily by his parents as they fled Japanese soldiers invading China.Liu had "the energy of a young man," recalled Daniel Liau, the delegation's host, who accompanied the travelers to the airport and helped them check their luggage. They stood chatting under the modernist scalloped ceilings of the main terminal for about 90 minutes. Later, after the group had passed through security and taken the monorail to the satellite terminal, Liau called them one last time."How are the artists?" he recalled asking one of the organizers, Hou Bo, who replied they had already reached the gate. "Everybody is OK," Hou assured him.Boarding began about midnight. The airline would have allowed the elderly - including Liu and his wife, Bao Yuanhua, 73 - and the families traveling with the two infants booked on the flight to get settled first. Next came the passengers holding passes for the 35 seats in business class.Philip Wood, 50, an IBM executive from Texas and a regular on the flight because he was relocating from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur, was in coach but hoped to be upgraded. He had long legs and a platinum frequent-flier card, said his partner, Sarah Bajc, 48, a teacher.Bajc said she exchanged a dozen text messages with him before the flight about the movers, scheduled to arrive at their home in Beijing the next morning. "We discussed the state of packing, what still needed to be done," she said. His last message came just before he left for the airport.Others on the flight were just passing through Kuala Lumpur, including Shi Xianwen, 26, a new father returning to China from a business trip to Australia. At the airport in Perth, he spent 40 minutes picking out a bracelet watch for his wife, whose birthday was approaching, an employee at the duty-free shop said.And two passengers boarded using stolen passports: Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, 19, and Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, Iranian men described by Interpol as migrants being smuggled into Europe.Mohammad Mallaeibasir, 18, an information technology student in Kuala Lumpur, said the pair stayed in his apartment the night before they left. Mehrdad, a friend from high school in Tehran, he said, told him he was starting a new life in Hamburg, Germany, where his mother was waiting."He was quite nervous," Mallaeibasir recalled. "I could see it on his face."The next night, he drove them to the airport and offered to help them check in, but they insisted on entering separately, Delavar first. The two high school buddies waited in the car for five to 10 minutes, smoking cigarettes, before Mehrdad got out to leave.Mallaeibasir gave him a hug, told him to have a safe flight and watched as his friend carried a large backpack and a laptop computer bag into the terminal. That was the last he saw of him.The plane the passengers boarded was a Boeing 777, one of the world's most popular and advanced passenger jets, and Boeing's first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, in which electronic controls replaced manual ones. Pilots send commands that are conveyed to the wings and other components, and a computer helps keep the plane steady.The "Triple Seven," as it often called, has all but replaced the 747 because it is cheaper to operate and can fly up to 16 hours without stopping to refuel. It also has one of the industry's best safety records, with only two serious accidents in the 19 years it has been in service.Malaysia Airlines, the nation's state-run carrier, began using the Boeing 777 in 1997 and eventually had 15 in its fleet. One of them, the 404th model to roll off Boeing's assembly line in Everett, Wash., was delivered to the airline in May 2002 and registered with tail number 9M-MRO. This was the plane used for Flight 370 that has disappeared.Malaysia Airlines has said the jet has been involved in only one previous safety incident. On Aug. 9, 2012, the tip of one of its wings broke off after it clipped the tail of a China Eastern Airlines AirbusA340 while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. No one was hurt. Boeing said it sent a team of engineers and mechanics to remove and replace the damaged wing sections, and returned the plane to service after testing.Boeing recommends a light maintenance inspection of the 777 after about 500 hours of flight time. Known as an "A check," the inspection usually is conducted in a hangar by a team of about 15 engineers working about 10 hours, often overnight. Malaysia Airlines said the jet's last "A check" took place Feb. 23, and uncovered no problems.By the time it pulled up to the gate at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8, the plane had completed more than 7,500 flights and clocked over 53,400 hours in the air, according to Flightglobal, a news and data service for the aviation sector. That put it well within the average economic life of 23 years for a wide-body passenger jet.In other words, there was little to distinguish this plane from the roughly 1,170 other Boeing 777s now in use. That is why it is so crucial to determine if the plane's disappearance was due to any malfunction or defect related to its design, build or engineering."The industry does not like uncertainty," said Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. "We will find out what happened."As they stepped on to the plane, the 227 passengers of Flight 370 were greeted by the flight attendants, four women in sarong kebayas and six men in gray three-piece suits. Some distributed hand towels, juice and newspapers in business class; others helped those in economy find their seats.Outside, ground crews loaded the passenger luggage into the jet's cargo hold, which can carry up to six pallets and 14 shipping containers. The airline said no hazardous or valuable goods were on the flight. But among the cargo were a "significant" number of lithium batteries - which can be flammable - more than is typically sent in a shipment, one U.S. official said.After the doors closed, the chief steward, Andrew Nari, would have welcomed the passengers via the loudspeaker and reminded them to turn off their cellphones. Before shutting off his own, he sent a message to his mother. "It was just a normal SMS telling me that his plane would fly off soon," she later told The Star, a local newspaper.In the cockpit were the pilots: the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, who joined the airline in 1981 and had 18,365 hours of flying experience, and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was transitioning to the Boeing 777 from the airline's narrow-body fleet.After nudging away from the gate, the plane taxied to runway 32R. The cabin lights would have dimmed before one of the pilots asked the crew to be seated for takeoff.With two Rolls-Royce Trent engines, each capable of generating more than 92,000 pounds of thrust, the jet raced down the 2.5-mile-long runway and lifted off at 41 minutes after midnight. As the plane banked and climbed, some passengers might have spotted the glow of Kuala Lumpur and perhaps the Petronas Towers in the distance.At 1:07 a.m., as the jet approached the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, ground crews received what the authorities have described as a routine text message from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, which sends regular updates on the condition of the plane by radio or satellite.By then, the first beverage service of the flight was most likely underway - soft drinks, juice and peanuts in economy; in business, various drinks, including Champagne, along with a snack such as charcoal-grilled chicken and lamb satay in peanut sauce. The in-flight entertainment system offered a wide selection of movies.Air traffic control in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, followed the plane by tracking its transponder, a device that "squawks" or emits an identifying signal in response to a signal from radar. The night began with Flight 370 squawking code 2157 and reporting altitude, speed and bearing.As the plane approached Vietnamese airspace, Subang informed the pilots that they were being transferred to radar control in Ho Chi Minh City. At 1:19 a.m., a voice identified by the authorities as that of the first officer, Fariq, replied, "All right, good night."Two minutes later, Flight 370's transponder stopped responding. It is unclear whether someone turned a dial on an instrument panel between the pilot and co-pilot and put the transponder in standby mode, or whether a malfunction caused it to go quiet.One moment, radar scopes showed the plane traveling northwest at 471 knots (542 mph). The next moment, it was gone.The military in Vietnam marked the time at 43 seconds past 1:20 a.m.As air traffic controllers struggled to re-establish contact with Flight 370, military radar at the Butterworth air force base on Malaysia's west coast picked up an unidentified aircraft near where the plane disappeared.But the watch team, normally an officer and three enlisted personnel, either failed to notice the signal or decided not to designate and track it as a "zombie," which would have pushed the information up the chain of command and possibly alerted air command.At a briefing on the base the next night, about 80 air force personnel were told there was "no proof" the unidentified signal showed the missing plane making a sharp turn, flying back across PeninsularMalaysia and then turning again and heading northwest over the Strait of Malacca, a person familiar with the situation said.But investigators now believe that is exactly what happened.The failure to recognize Flight 370 in the radar data - or refusal to do so, to avoid the embarrassment of admitting an unidentified plane had breached air defense - meant the Malaysian authorities continued to search in the seas to the east instead of the west of the peninsula. Military radar last recorded the signal at 2:22 a.m., about 200 nautical miles northwest of Butterworth, according to an image of the radar track.The authorities also failed to move quickly on data that showed the plane continuing to fly nearly seven more hours: a series of regular handshake signals from the plane to a satellite seeking to determine if the aircraft was still in range.Chris McLaughlin, a vice president at Inmarsat, the satellite communications firm, said technicians pulled the logs of all transmissions from the plane within four hours of its disappearance. Then, after a day without sign of the plane, they began scouring the company's databases for any trace of Flight 370."We decided to go have another look at our network to see if there was any data that we had missed," McLaughlin said. It turned out there was. Inmarsat technicians identified what appeared to be a series of fleeting "pings" between Flight 370, a satellite over the Indian Ocean and a ground station in Perth, Australia.The signals - seven of them transmitted at one-hour intervals - were an important clue, because they could have come only from an antenna receiving power from the plane itself. But while they carried a unique code identifying the aircraft as Flight 370, the signals contained no positioning or other data that could indicate where the plane was when it sent them.By Sunday afternoon, a team of Inmarsat engineers set to work using the principles of trigonometry to determine the distance between the satellite and the plane at the time of each ping, and then to calculate two rough flight paths. The plane, they concluded, had turned again. But it may have then traveled in more or less a straight line, heading north over countries likely to have picked it up on radar, or south toward the Indian Ocean and Antarctica.The Malaysian government said it received Inmarsat's data on March 12 and spent three days analyzing and vetting it with investigators from the United States before redirecting the search on March 15.By then, more than a week had passed since the last satellite ping, recorded at 8:11 a.m. on March 8. It appears to have come from over the southern Indian Ocean, halfway around the world from where the plane should have been, on a tarmac in Beijing.###4607||Empty###4608||TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Florida's latest unemployment numbers are coming out and could signal whether the state's economic recovery is continuing.



The state's unemployment numbers for January will be released on Monday. The rate in the month of December was 6.2 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.



Payroll provider ADP reported that the state added 11,610 private sector jobs in January and 10,840 additional jobs during the month of February. ADP's survey is separate from the one that is conducted by government agencies.



Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.



But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

The executive in charge of the cloud business, the CFO the Senior Vice President and the heads of both enterprise and consumer business at Symantec have left since Bennett's appointment. On top of that Symantec has failed to attract new talent as engineers are attracted instead to new competitors such as FireEye and Palo Alto networks as well as to security roles within other technology companies.

One thing that public markets really hate is ongoing executive churn within a company. So the news today that Symantec Corp has fired its president and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such move in less than two years, will cause real concern.

Symantec is well known for producing the Norton AntiVirus software, but it's fair to say that the move away from PCs, the increasing use of software subscription models and related lessening appetite for licence-based products alongside the rise of mobile applications have all created a very unstable marketplace for the company. While other companies have seen the mid-term horizon and managed to make some big changes (a good example being Dell which went private in order to have the freedom to embark on a new strategy built on the back of becoming a services-based business), Symantec has been less successful at navigating this path.

The company has been working through a reorganization plan to deal with weak earnings, but reorganization is different from reinvention and this is something that Symantec will come to realize. This is perhaps the rationale for the firing, said Chairman Daniel Schulman;

This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety

As a temporary measure, the company has named Michael Brown as interim president and CEO, effective immediately but, at the same time, has begun a search for a permanent replacement. Bennett joined the Symantec board in 2010 after stints at General Electric and Intuit. He took the CEO role in July 2012 after the board "requested" that Enrique Salem step down from the role.

As for the interim CEO, Brown joined the board following the merger with Veritas Software in 2005. Previously he served as both chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

I reached out to Symantec to see what the move means in light of the company's need to truly reimagine what it fundamentally does as a business. Symantec declined to comment and referred me to their press release which, unfortunately for the company, flags some turbulent waters to come, at least in terms of revenue.###4613||HONG KONG-- China Telecom Corp. said 2013 net profit rose 17% as it added more high-value mobile customers.

The country's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers bought its mobile-service business in 2008 from China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. as part of a government-mandated restructuring of the telecommunications sector and has spent heavily on the business.

Analysts have said that China Telecom's profitability is expected to improve from 2013 as its efforts to attract high-spending users begin to pay off.

Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 17.55 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) from 14.95 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 14% to 321.58 billion yuan.

China's telecommunications carriers have focused on improving their networks to meet an increase in data traffic as more consumers replace basic cellphones with smartphones. China has already overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest smartphone market and mobile-data demand is expected to rise.

China Unicom, another major Chinese carrier, reported last month a 47% increase in full-year earnings as smaller players continue to attract customers from market leader China Mobile Ltd.

China Mobile, the world's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, reports full-year earnings on Thursday and is expected to post a profit fall as it boosted network investments and handset subsidies to battle competition.

China Telecom and China Unicom will benefit from lower interconnection fees that they pay to China Mobile from the beginning of this year, as the government seeks to promote competition in the sector. Savings from lower interconnection fees will allow smaller carriers to fund network upgrades and marketing campaigns, allowing them to boost market share, analysts said.

China Mobile is the country's dominant mobile phone network carrier, with more than 770 million mobile subscribers and over 50% of domestic market share. China Telecom is the smallest of the country's three main mobile carriers.

Write to Lorraine Luk at lorraine.luk@wsj.com###4614||Empty###4615||If water managers wielded a divining rod, the forked end would not point toward the heavens nor the Sierra Nevada. It would bend toward a major water source hundreds of feet beneath the Earth”s crust.

Indeed, with zero percent allocation from the State Water Project and a state mired in the third year of drought, even recent rainstorms can”t bring the familiar sources — aqueducts carrying water from Northern California — back to normal.

Instead, managers must find salvation in vast, underground lakes holding billions of gallons of fresh water stretching from the San Fernando to the San Gabriel Valley, from Southeast L.A. County to the West Basin and the Santa Ana River into the Inland Empire.

Once the man-made reservoirs run low — say by this time next year — water managers will depend on their last resort, the basins.

In short, water managers say they have enough supplies to get us through a third year of drought and a dusty summer without pressing the crisis button. But “Drought 2015” will become a game of aquifers and attitudes.

For example, jumping ahead a year, the city of Los Angeles may be in the worst shape.

Thirty years ago, Los Angeles received 70 percent of its water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct and 15 percent from both ground water aquifers and imported water purchased from Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Today, the numbers have changed dramatically to 40 percent from the L.A. Aqueduct, 10 percent from ground water and 50 percent from MWD, said Marty Adams, head of water operations at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Relying more and more on state water imported from Northern California is not a secure formula. This year, the agency celebrated the 100th anniversary of the L.A. Aqueduct. Hidden amid the fanfare was this statistic: the lowest amount of water came down the concrete channel in its history, Adams said.

In its heydey, the L.A. Aqueduct, which once turned Mono Lake into a salt flat, yielded 460,000 acre-feet of water. This year, it yielded 60,000 acre-feet, he said. An acre-foot of water is one acre of land covered in water 1 foot deep or about enough water for two families for a year.

In 2015, the LADWP will be forced to buy between 70 percent and 75 percent of its supplies from MWD, Adams said. The MWD reserves — stored since 2009, the year the last drought ended — are available at near 100 percent capacity at Pyramid Lake, Castaic Lake and Diamond Valley Lake in Hemet.

The only problem may be getting that water to the people in the San Fernando Valley, Adams said. “Their (MWD”s) biggest pool of water is not physically accessible to the San Fernando Valley but we can shift. We can make it work,” he said.

One of the angles is to clean up the ground water basin in the Valley, buy supplemental water from MWD, blend it with the aqueduct water and deliver it to customers. LADWP can also buy water from East Los Angeles that originated in the Colorado River and pump it through an underground pipeline beneath the Santa Monica Mountains to the west San Fernando Valley, he said.

Of course, Adams is concerned about using up all the reserves.

“Metropolitan has said they have enough storage for this year. The question is, how much do we use from those reservoirs? You want to use them very judiciously,” Adams said.

The biggest losers will be farmers that do not have contracts for water from the State Water Project or the federal Central Valley Project. Both have decided not to release water to any users not signed up. Also, allocations will be drastically reduced.

“I can”t impress enough how serious the situation is, particularly for agriculture in the state,” said Shane Chapman, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a wholesale water agency whose district includes about 1 million people.

About 1.5 million acres of land could be fallowed in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, he said. Farmers will not plant some crops in order to maximize high-profit crops, such as almonds and pistachios, he said.

The recent torrential rainstorms dumped 4 inches in downtown Los Angeles and brought the season total to 5.72 inches, about 49 percent of the average, said Bill Patzert, meteorologist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge.

“We are still 50 percent down. It is still a dry year,” he said

Rainfall in the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains was higher, but the runoff didn”t reach the underground aquifers.

“It didn”t help the drought at all. It is like trying to catch water in a champagne glass when someone is shooting a firehose at you. Most of it ends up in the ocean,” he said.

Adams would rather see the snow build up in Mammoth and the Eastern Sierra. But it will take close to 40 feet of snow there to return water supplies to normal, he said.

The Los Angeles County Flood Control District experts say they”ve been able to capture 100 percent of the water from the San Gabriel River during a normal year. That”s because the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers are mostly soft-bottomed, meaning they allow water to seep into the ground. Most of the L.A. River is concrete and impervious.

Water is captured in spreading grounds — areas of rock and gravel and berms — that like a sponge soak water into the underground aquifer. The most important aspect, aside from protecting homes from floods, is recharging the ground water, said Adam Walden, senior engineer with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works.

Unfortunately, Southern California”s basins are over pumped and abused. San Gabriel and San Fernando are peppered with contamination from years of dumping by the aerospace industry going back to the 1950s, rendering some wells inoperative.

“Ground water … is a diminishing resource as it is being pumped at rates that exceed current rates of natural recharge, leading to challenges related to saltwater intrusion, basin salinity, and increased need for imported water,” according to the Council for Watershed Health”s report on the Central and West basins.###4616||Empty###4617||After banning Twitter last night, the actions of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan have failed spectacularly.

Immediately following Turkey’s ban, Twitter issued an SMS workaround. Then, “#TwitterisblockedinTurkey” became a globally trending topic on Twitter. Into the night, usage of Google’s free DNS service exploded to circumvent the blockage of Twitter’s domain. Now, social media analysis firms Brandwatch and We Are Social report that Turkish tweets last night and this morning are up by a massive 138 percent.

The following graph, provided by Brandwatch, shows the rise in tweets from 2 A.M. to 12 P.M. (Turkish CET).

Turkish users collectively tweeted 2.5 million times since the ban went into effect, potentially “setting new records for Twitter use in the country,” according to a different study reported by the Guardian.

Fanning the flames, usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) in Turkey appears to be up significantly. ZenMate, for example — a security and privacy extension for Google Chrome — reports it saw “25,000 visitors from Turkey to the Chrome store in the last 12 hours.” Similarly, VPN provider Hotspot Shield saw an uptick in usage on iOS, and is now the top Android app in the Google Play store in Turkey.

Studies such as the above serve only as rough guidelines and are limited by sample size. Collectively, however, the reports make for strong evidence that Erdogan has failed to enact an effective country-wide ban on Twitter.

MONTPELIER (AP) - The Vermont Department of Labor says the state's unemployment rate for January was 4 percent, a drop of two-tenths of one percent from December.

The Vermont rate, the fourth consecutive reported monthly decrease for the state, compares to a national unemployment rate of 6.6 percent for January.

Unemployment in Vermont's 17 labor markets ranged from a low of 2.5 percent in Warren-Waitsfield to a high of 7 percent in the Newport area.

Employment sectors that had significant job growth last month include state government, which added about 1,400 jobs, and professional and business services, 700 jobs.

The most significant declines came from construction, which dropped 800 jobs.###4621||Empty###4622||Empty###4623||This will appear next to all of your comments

By Abhirup Roy

March 21 (Reuters) - Symantec Corp’s shares fell as much as 14 percent on Friday, a day after the security software maker fired its chief executive, raising concerns about its turnaround efforts.

At least five brokerages downgraded the stock, which has fallen nearly 17 percent in the past six months as the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, struggles with falling PC sales and a lackluster show on smartphone and tablets.

Steve Bennett, who took over as CEO in July 2012, had launched a strategic review of the business after replacing company veteran Enrique Salem, who was fired after three years on the job.

Since Bennett took over, the company’s shares had gained more than 40 percent to Thursday’s close.

“The first year was terrific, the last six months have been terrible,” MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez said.

“I think he got success with the low hanging fruit initially, but when he started to tackle the difficult challenge of changing the sales culture and reorganizing the sales organization ... that’s when the cookie crumbled,” Hernandez said.

Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz said morale had improved under Bennett.

Schwartz said Bennett’s exit, which follows several other departures over the past seven months, could hurt morale in Symantec.

He downgraded the company’s stock to “hold” from “buy” and cut his price target to $22 from $29. The company’s shares were down 12.7 percent at $18.25 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

Symantec’s chief financial officer of seven years, James Beer, resigned last September, while its president of products and services quit in November.

Chairman Daniel Schulman said the company was looking for a leader who would drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.

However, MKM’s Hernandez said it would be challenging for Symantec to get a new CEO as the market for talent had become competitive.

Analysts say Symantec has failed to evolve its antivirus and security products fast enough and keep pace with network security software makers such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks.

Network security software products are in demand as they analyse business networks and try to preempt cyber attacks, while antivirus software removes threats after computers have already been infected.

Research firm Gartner said in 2012 that the market for security software was expected to grow about 30 percent to $87 billion by 2016. (r.reuters.com/dyx77v)

Symantec has also struggled to gain a foothold in the fast growing mobile security software market, which is dominated by companies such as Lookout Inc, NQ Mobile Inc, Avast Software and Kaspersky.

Cowen and Co analyst Gregg Moskowitz said the departure of a cost-conscious CEO, combined with Symantec’s recent mis-execution and absence of continuity at the top, had reduced his confidence in the company’s ability to improve long-term operating margins.

Moskowitz downgraded the stock to “market perform” from “outperform.”

Mountain View, California-based Symantec appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO on Thursday.

Bennett may get as much as $18.5 million in severance payment, based on his employment agreement. His total compensation was $13 million for the fiscal year ended March 2013.

Problems for Symantec started in 2005 after it bought storage software maker Veritas in a $13.5 billion deal. Since then, Symantec has repeatedly disappointed Wall Street with weak numbers, mainly due to falling PC sales.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 27. (Additional reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Kirti Pandey)###4625||Empty###4626||Why did this happen?

Changes to this year’s stress test

Starting in 2009 with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the stress tests are something of a work in progress. Every year the conditions change (and hopefully improve) to give the government a better idea of how the financial system will hold up during the next financial crisis.

This year the Federal Reserve stopped depending on banks’ own balance sheet and risk-weighted asset growth projections, instead using independent estimates that should improve the consistency of the results. The stress tests were also expanded from the original 18 banks that have taken part since 2009 to include an additional 12 institutions with at least $50 billion in total assets.

The revised capital framework that was approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 was partially phased in during this round of stress tests, and eight institutions with the largest trading and custodial operations were also tested under a global trading shock scenario by estimating losses from their largest counterparty defaulting unexpectedly.

Adverse and severe adverse scenarios

The serious adverse scenario is meant to model a severe recession: a sharp rise in unemployment, equity markets down 50%, and housing prices down to 2001 levels lasting nine quarters. Under this scenario the 30 BHCs would have a combined $366 billion in loan losses, and the aggregate tier 1 common capital ratio would drop from an actual 11.5% to an estimated 7.6%. Considering that the actual tier 1 ratio was 5.5% when the first stress test was conducted in 2009, it’s clear how much progress the financial system has made adjusting to the new capital requirements. Most BHCs fall in the range from just under 6%, still an improvement over the 2009 average, to more than 13%, but Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION)’s has just 3.5% tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the severe adverse stress test.

Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION)’s was also the worst performer under the adverse scenario, which models a moderate recession, but the gap was less pronounced. Overall, the average tier 1 capital ratio falls from 11.5% to 9.7% under adverse conditions, giving some confidence that the financial system is better equipped to deal with unexpected shocks than it was before the last crisis.###4634||###4635||Empty###4636||Empty###4637||Today’s new Top Pick for 2014 is $169 billion giant in the computer industry.

Chancellor George Osborne's facelift for the £1 coin could have unintended consequences for the UK's economy.

Designed to tackle counterfeiting in the UK, the new 12-sided coin should be much harder to forge than existing currency.

The Royal Mint estimates that three per cent of all £1 coins are fakes, or £45m worth.

Some warn that this counterfeiting - in a demand-driven recession - is less of a problem that it might seem.

Ben Southwood, head of macro policy at the Adam Smith Institute, says that production of fake coins means higher aggregate demand, less unemployment, and a narrower output gap.

"While the Bank of England kept policy too tight, counterfeiters were doing their job for them," says Southwood.

But counterfeiting is merely a partial band-aid for the Bank of England's unwillingness to support aggregate demand.

Southwood recommends that as Osborne closes down the counterfeiting route to buoying aggregate demand, "he should open up a more legitimate one, telling the Bank of England to ignore inflation and switch to targeting nominal income or wages."###4639||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

The company named board member Michael Brown to lead while the company seeks Bennett's replacement.

Fired: Former Symantec CEO Steve Bennett.

A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, the company said on Thursday (Friday morning Australian time).

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem's ousting in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record slump in PC sales curbs spending on Symantec's anti-virus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock has tumbled 15 per cent in the past year.

Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.###4641||What would you get if you combined your income tax filing with the health history form you fill out at your doctor’s office?

An application for Obamacare.

While improvements in the federal website have made the enrollment process smoother, it could never be called “easy.” That’s because it asks for lots of personal and financial data at the same time it requires decisions about health care.

Is it more important to save money or have access to the doctor you’ve been seeing for years? Would you rather pay more in monthly premiums for a policy that had lower co-pays, or have lower premiums and higher co-pays? And looking into that crystal ball you brought along just in case, how much do you think you’ll make this year?

With just 12 days left to buy private health insurance through the federal website, the easiest way to get through the process may be to have someone guide you through the journey.

Those people have a name — “navigators” — and they’re scattered around the state, ready to help.

One way to find them is to click the “Find Local Help” button on HealthCare.gov. By typing in your ZIP code, you can see what groups and institutions have federal grants to provide help.

Another route would be to call your local hospital. Many are offering enrollment guidance themselves, or know where to find such help nearby. Check njha.com/reform to see a list of sign-up sessions scheduled between now and March 31, the deadline to purchase private insurance through the federal exchange.

There are two enrollment offices in the northern part of the state that work directly with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If you have a complicated set of circumstances, it may be worth the ride to consult them. The Edison enrollment assistance center is at 1719 State Route 27, Festival Plaza, (732-484-9710). The Wayne center is at 1211 Hamburg Turnpike, Suite 301, (201-414-0465).

Both centers are open seven days a week.

Another option is to consult a local insurance broker who handles health insurance. While agents typically handle small business accounts, they can handle individuals as well, said David Oscar, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters. Their help is free to clients; agents ultimately get paid by the insurance carrier for sending business its way.

You can locate a nearby agent at njahu.org.

Even with the help of a trained professional, the experts say to plan on spending at least 90 minutes on the process — longer if you’re enrolling on behalf of a large family.

The most difficult part may be “reading the questions thoroughly and not reading them too fast,” said Oscar. Some of the questions are silly, he said, such as the one asking about the pregnancy status of all females in the household, including infants.

That’s why it helps to gather all the information you need before you apply, whether that application is by phone (800-318-2596), computer (HealthCare.gov), or face-to-face:

• Not just your Social Security number, but the numbers of everyone you’re signing up for, including small children. (You don’t need proof of your Social Security number; you just need to know what it is.)

• If you are a permanent resident, bring your green card.

• If you are switching from a policy you have but don’t like, bring that policy number and company name.

• Something that helps document your income, whether it’s your taxes for last year, or better yet, recent pay stubs. You will be required to state your best guess for what you’ll earn in 2014, and the more accurate your prediction, the better, say tax advisers.###4642||McDONALDS TO GET 47% REDUCTION IN GRAFTON STREET RENT - McDonald's fast food chain is to have its rent reduced by 47% on Dublin's Grafton Street less than two weeks before the Supreme Court is due to review a separate High Court ruling that the rent on another Grafton Street café, Bewley's, must be allowed to fall in line with the depressed open market rate. The background to the two rental arrangements are entirely different, writes the Irish Times. McDonald's has negotiated a lower rent under a new lease agreement while the Bewley's lease is still subject to five yearly upwards-only reviews. McDonald's had been paying an overall rent of €1.15 million under a 35-year lease which ran out at the end of 2011. That figure has now dropped to €600,000 and with upwards-only clauses no longer allowed, five yearly reviews are now based primarily on open market rental values. The landlords in this case - Royal London Mutual Life and Pension Fund - had indicated in advance of the review that it would also be looking for a premium of at least 30% on the rent to take account of the scarcity value of having a round-the-clock food business on the city's premier high street and also because of the sheer size of the building - it extends to 1,858sq m (20,000sq ft). Natalie Brennan of CBRE said the issue of the premium "was factored into the discussions and was taken on board". Grafton Street earned a reputation during the property boom for being one of the most expensive high streets in the world.

BANK OF IRELAND TO SCRAP 'DELEVERAGING' ROLE FOLLOWING DONOVAN'S RETIREMENT - Bank of Ireland will not appoint a new head of its "non-core division" following the retirement of previous head Denis Donovan, the Irish Independent has learned. As well as heading up the unit, Mr Donovan sat on the group executive committee, the team under chief executive Richie Boucher that oversees the day-to-day running of the bank. Following his retirement the role of head of group non-core division is "no longer required", according to an internal memo sent to staff and seen by the newspaper. The group non-core division was responsible for meeting a "deleveraging" target set for the bank, which included selling off €10 billion of international loan assets, as well as being charged with the bank's management of NAMA loans. Its understood the decision not to appoint a senior manager to replace Mr Donovan reflects the fact that much of the unit's work has already been completed. Instead, the bank has appointed two senior managers as new members of the group executive committee, according to the memo.

'NO FIRMS HIT BY TAX CLAMPDOWN' - Not a single company has contacted the tax authorities to say they have been affected by changes announced in the budget as part of Finance Minister Michael Noonan's clampdown on international tax avoidance, reports the Irish Examiner. In October's budget, Mr Noonan included a measure that required any company incorporated in Ireland to be tax resident either in this country or another jurisdiction. Multinationals had been exploiting a loophole in the Irish tax system that enabled them to incorporate companies here that were not tax resident in any other state. In response to a parliamentary question from Michael McGrath, Fianna Fáil's finance spokesman, Mr Noonan said no companies had been affected by this change. "I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not, to date, been advised by any company that is or will be affected by the change in residence rules as to where it is actually resident following the announcement of the change in the budget," he said. Mr McGrath said he was "amazed" that not a single company had been hit by the rule change.

OSBORNE LOSES POUND AND FINDS THREEPENCE - George Osborne is to scrap the current £1 coin and replace it with a 12-sided version reminiscent of the old threepenny bit, in a Budget move that may appeal to the patriotism and nostalgia of a key section of the electorate. The chancellor took a personal interest in the design of the new coin, whose retro-look will incorporate anti-forgery features which Mr Osborne claims will make it the most secure coin in circulation in the world, says the Financial Times. In a Budget with little money for populist “giveaways”, Mr Osborne’s back-to-the-future coin may turn out to be one of the biggest talking points of his statement. Mr Osborne says the current £1 coin, which has been in circulation for over 30 years, is increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters so that about 3% of all the coins in circulation are fakes. In his role as Master of the Mint, Mr Osborne will announce plans for a replacement coin to be introduced in 2017, of bimetallic construction and of two colours, but crucially with 12 sides. Treasury officials admit the coin’s resemblance to the old threepenny bit has little to do with security and everything to do with nostalgia; the new design is a reincarnation of a coin that was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation 1971.###4643||City Index

Asian markets were down across the board today (March 20th) on the back of the latest suggestion interest rates could soon be increased in the US.

After chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen stated that rates might be put up by the body next year, markets such as the Nikkei were down.

Ms Yellen took over as chair of the Fed towards the end of last year, replacing Ben Bernanke in the role. She was the preferred candidate of US president Barack Obama to take the leadership of the body.

The Fed has continued to wind down its bond-buying programme and Ms Yellen suggested interest rates could be increased from zero per cent six months after that scheme has come to an end.

Markets down

These comments from the Fed's chair hurt Asian markets, with the Nikkei down by 1.65 per cent over the course of the session following her press conference. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite were also down on the back of Ms Yellen's statement, with each suffering from a loss of more than one per cent.

Peter Redward, of Redward Associates, suggested that the impact of an increase to US interest rates is not going to be the same in Asia as it will be in some of the world's emerging markets.

"We're going to see the type of reaction we've seen in other emerging markets which means interest rates are probably going to climb as well," he told the BBC, suggesting the first Asian country to increase interest rates could be the Philippines.

Mr Redward added: "The issue for Asia is that the US isn't the locomotive for this region that it once was. The rise of China and the relative decline of the US means that it just isn't going to pull the region forward like it has in the past."

A rise in US interest rates could put pressure on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to increase the UK's base rate, which has stood at a record low of 0.5 per cent for the last five years.

For your aging game to qualify, you must bring in a working disc in its original packaging to Walmart's electronics department. After the game disc is checked for cracks and deep scratches, you'll receive a price quote for the amount Walmart is willing to pay.

Accepted games will receive their trade-in value in eGift cards that can be used at Walmart and Sam's club locations and online. Walmart's gift card policy is in line with other video game trade-in retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and Gamestop.

This is the second time Walmart has ventured into the used video game market, but the first time the company has managed the entire operation itself. In 2009, Walmart partnered with e-Play to bring automated video game trade-in kiosks into select Walmart stores in the U.S. The venture lasted less than a year, however, coming to an abrupt end in February 2010 after e-Play suspended operations, according to Joystiq.

This time around, Walmart wants to get its attempt at used games right and is launching with a more expansive program than the 80-store trial market with e-Play.

"With more than 110 million gamers in the U.S., we see enormous potential in the $2 billion pre-owned video game business opportunity," Walmart said in a blog post Tuesday.

Walmart didn't specify in its announcement exactly which console platforms its trade-in program will support. But Walmart Spokesperson Sarah McKinney told us the company will accept any game from any platform as long as the game has market value.

Walmart will start accepting games next Wednesday, but it doesn't plan on selling the used games in its stores until this summer. Used games will be sold at Walmart locations and online.

This article has been updated to include Sarah McKinney's statement.

By Nate Raymond and Silke Koltrowitz

NEW YORK/ZURICH, March 21 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay $885 million to resolve claims by a U.S. regulator that the Swiss bank misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.

The settlement announced on Friday would resolve claims in two lawsuits filed in New York by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies.

It is the ninth settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011, when it filed 18 lawsuits over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

The accord resolves claims pending in New York federal court against Credit Suisse over $16.6 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and ends what the Swiss bank called the largest mortgage-related investor litigation it still faced.

Credit Suisse will pay $234 million to Fannie Mae and $651 million to Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.

So far, the FHFA has recovered more than $10.1 billion from banks over similar securities.

This includes nearly $9.8 billion in settlements of litigation with such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The FHFA also reached a separate $335.2 million accord with Wells Fargo & Co, which it did not formally sue.

Many of the settlements were reached after a series of series of court rulings that went against the banks.

Lawsuits remain pending against several other banks, including Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

Credit Suisse said on Friday it will reduce previously reported fourth-quarter and 2013 results by 275 million Swiss francs ($311.17 million) after taxes for the settlement, resulting in a fourth-quarter net loss of 8 million Swiss francs.

While Credit Suisse said the settlement resolves the biggest mortgage case it faced, the bank still must deal with other mortgage cases in the United States, including ones by the National Credit Union Administration and attorneys general in New York and New Jersey.

Credit Suisse is also one of 14 Swiss banks targeted by U.S. prosecutors for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank has said it is trying to settle that matter.

Last month, the Zurich-based bank agreed to pay $196.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it provided unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients.

The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06200.###4651||Walmart Will Accept Video Game Trade-Ins Starting on March 26th in the US

Walmart will allow for trade-ins to Walmart employees starting today, with official trade-ins to customers beginning on March 26th at over 3,100 stores. Then, in the Summer, Walmart will be reselling the used games in stores and online, calling them “Certified Pre-Owned”.

Walmart made sure to note that “new releases will still remain the focus of our business,” but when it comes to trading in games for a Walmart gift card (which can be used to buy anything in stores and online), their strategy is “to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want.” They also added, “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins.”

All three of Ohio's largest banks passed the latest round of stress tests mandated by regulators, meaning they would be expected to survive if the economy collapsed like it did six years ago.

Only one of the 30 banks most significant to the U.S. financial system, Zions Bank of Salt Lake City, didn't pass the stress test imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Locally, KeyCorp of Cleveland, Fifth Third of Cincinnati and Huntington of Columbus all passed, as did three other banks with a significant presence in Northeast Ohio: PNC, Chase and U.S. Bank.

The tests have been assessed four times since 2009 on the 18 most significant banks. This year, however, 12 banks with more than $50 billion in assets were added. That added banks like Huntington.

The tests look at how the bank would fare if it were pounded by loan losses and were hemorrhaging capital.

Specifically, regulators looked at the health of the banks if the economy was hit by a deep recession with high unemployment, a tanking stock market and a drop in home values to 2001 levels.

In addition, the tests this year looked at what would happen if a bank's largest counterparty defaulted.

One part of the stress test looked at potential loan loss rates among the banks. Key, Fifth Third and Huntington all were below the average of 5.6 percent.



In this post-meltdown era, banks must get approval for things they spend capital on, such as dividends paid to shareholders and purchases of other banks. The Federal Reserve next week will release results on whether the banks' requests for their capital have been approved.

Pandora (NYSE:P) revealed last night that its premium Pandora One offering will also soon set music buffs back a little more.

Existing monthly Internet radio subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 a month -- for now -- but new subscribers will have to shell out $4.99 a month starting in May. This doesn't mean that existing premium members won't pay more. The annual Pandora One plan that costs $36 -- or $3 a month -- is being discontinued. Users will migrate to the $3.99-a-month plan.

Pandora said the increases are necessary. It hasn't tweaked its prices since 2009, yet in that time the royalty rates that it pays to artists through SoundExchange have soared 53%. It's a similar rationale that Amazon used with its $20 Prime fee increase, arguing that shipping costs alone have escalated in the nine years that it stuck to the $79-a-year pricing.

However, some may wonder if Pandora is picking the wrong time to push through an increase. Amazon doesn't really have any material competition when it comes to e-commerce, but Pandora is starting to feel the pinch from the competition. Listener hours in February rose just 9% since last year's showing. This is the first time that year-over-year growth at Pandora has slumped into the single digits. It's a far cry from the 101% and 42% growth spurts that Pandora had posted in prior February installments.

Growth is still growth, but Pandora's monthly metrics have showed sequential spottiness since Apple introduced iTunes Radio in mid-September. One can argue that most of Pandora's listeners are freeloaders, making this increase irrelevant. That's true. Just 3.3 million of its 75.3 million active listeners are paying Pandora for commercial-free access. The other 72 million are fine putting up with ads and any other limitations that Pandora may throw their way.

In terms of premium competition, Sirius XM Radio (NASDAQ:SIRI) listeners with satellite receiver plans can pay an additional $4 a month for online access. Pandora's pricing now makes its online offering more expensive than Sirius XM's add-on platform. That's worth noting.

This still doesn't make the price hike a dumb move by Pandora. If anything, pre-announcing that the increase will take place in May could encourage current freeloaders to sign up for the $3.99 a month in the next few weeks so that they will be grandfathered into the lower rate. The move should also help with Pandora One churn. Folks will be less tempted to cancel the service if they know that coming back would cost them $4.99 a month.

That's important. Netflix has also suggested that it will eventually roll out higher prices to new members, generously grandfathering in existing members at existing rates. Amazon isn't being as generous with Prime, though it is waiting until annual renewal dates to institute the $20 increase.

Leaning on the Internet for legal ad-free entertainment is starting to get more expensive. Now we have to see if consumers are willing to accept the increases.###4655||Share. Don't expect cash for your games, though. Don't expect cash for your games, though.

Exit Theatre Mode

Starting March 26, gamers will be able to trade in used games at Walmart which will in turn begin being sold to the public later this year.

The process is simple: bring in your used game, with its original packaging, to the electronics department of any of the 3,100 Walmart stores across the United States. An associate will scan your game and give it a once-over to determine its value before providing you with a credit voucher that can be used in any Walmart or Sam's Club both in store and online. Your trade-in will then be refurbished and sold as a used title beginning "later this year."

Unlike GameStop, however, Walmart will not offer the option of receiving cash for game trade-ins, nor will it accept video game hardware.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a press release. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart has tested the used game market in the past; it previously had a small, kiosk-based game trading system located in some of it stores.

Twitter users in Turkey report that the social media site has been blocked in the country.

Some users trying to open the twitter.com website are apparently being redirected to a statement by Turkey's telecommunications regulator.

It cites a court order to apply "protection measures" on the website.

This comes after PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "wipe out Twitter" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle.

The BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul reports that he is unable to access Twitter.

"I don't care what the international community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic," Mr Erdogan said earlier on Thursday.

He spoke after some users had posted documents reportedly showing evidence of corruption relating to the prime minister - a claim he denies.

His office said that Twitter had not responded to Turkey's court rulings to remove some links, forcing Ankara to act.

Twitter has so far made no public comment on the issue.

There are about 10m Twitter users across Turkey.

In 2010, the country lifted its ban on YouTube - two years after it blocked access to the website because of videos deemed insulting to the country's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.###4658||Empty###4659||Empty###4660||###4661||Top Consumer Shares:

Consumer shares were higher in pre-market trade Tuesday.

In consumer sector news, footwear retailer DSW ( DSW ) reported fiscal Q4 adjusted earnings above analysts' estimates and boosted its quarterly dividend by 50%, but sales missed expectations and the company gave a weaker-than-expected fiscal-year forecast.

For the quarter ended Feb. 1, the company posted net income of $28.1 million, or $0.30 per share, compared with prior-year net income of $27.1 million, or $0.30 per share. There were 0.9% more shares outstanding in the latest period.

And, shares of new and used video-game seller GameStop ( GME ) fell in Tuesday's pre-market session, after big-box retailer Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT ) said it will start buying used video games from customers next week.

Starting March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately toward the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition "at a great low price," the company said.###4662||Why did this happen?

Visa and MasterCard have blocked credit card services to some Russian bank customers as a result of US sanctions.

Four banks are so far affected, all of which have links to Russians blacklisted by the US.

Visa and MasterCard, both US-based companies, are forbidden from having any dealings with those targeted by the sanctions.

The banks, which said card services stopped without warning, have described the move as unlawful.

'Frozen out'

One of the banks affected, Bank Rossiya, is described by the US as Russia's 15th largest, with assets of $12bn (£7.27bn).

The St Petersburg-based bank has been singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials. US officials said it would be "frozen out" from the dollar.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bank Rossiya had nothing to do with events in Crimea and promised to transfer his wages there.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to protect Bank Rossiya

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

President Putin also instructed the Russian central bank to step in, if needed, but the latter said the sanctions on Bank Rossiya did "not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability".

'Illegitimate'

Visa and Mastercard also confirmed they had stopped providing services to SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday. Vladimir Putin, Russian President

The bank, which is Russia's 39th biggest with $5bn in assets, called the actions "illegitimate" because its owners, rather than the bank itself, were the subject of sanctions.

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

But Visa said more than 99% of its business in Russia was untouched by sanctions.

Russian shares fell sharply on Friday as investors weighed the impact of western sanctions over Ukraine.

The MICEX index, which is priced in roubles, fell as much as 3% and the RTS, which is priced in dollars fell 3.6%.

Stocks slumped after US President Barack Obama said sanctions might be extended to key parts of the Russian economy if Russia took further action in Ukraine.

Share falls

Russia's mining, defence and natural resources sectors could all be targets.

Stocks recovered some ground during the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to restore calm following the introduction of asset freezes and visa bans by the US against high ranking Russian officials.

The MICEX closed down 1% and the RTS index was down 1.3% at the end of the day.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Allies of the Russian president targeted by US sanctions include railways boss Vladimir Yakunin (left)

Although only banks with connections to high-ranking Russian officials have been targeted, Russian bank shares were broadly lower.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed 1.17% lower - having fallen 2.9% earlier on Friday, while shares in VTB Bank were 2.61% lower after falling 4.3% earlier in the day.

Other sectors were also hit. Gas giant Gazprom was down 0.9%, oil firm Lukoil ended the day 1.36% higher. Russian steel company NLMK closed 1.94% lower.

Shares in gas producer Novatek closed down 9.63%. The company is part owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder in Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy Russian businessmen targeted by Western sanctions.

Negative outlook

Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch warned they were changing their outlook for the Russian economy to "negative" from "stable" - the first stage before a possible downgrade in the country's credit rating - because of the potential impact of sanctions.

Fitch said: "Since US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Gennady Timchenko, owner of gas firm Novatek and shareholder in Bank Rossiya, has been targeted by sanctions

President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised the move, suggesting it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

Russia's credit rating is currently BBB.

Meanwhile the rouble was stable on Friday having previously fallen sharply on Thursday evening in response to the announcement of further US sanctions.

Later on Friday morning Germany said it had decided to suspend approval of all defence-related exports to Russia.

Berlin ordered defence contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear to Russia earlier this week.

The ministry spokesman said this was a "one-off" case, but future deals would also be blocked.

"The (Rheinmetall) case that you are talking about is a one-off case. Nevertheless it is true that given the current situation in Russia, we are not approving any exports of defence goods to this country at the moment," the spokesman said.###4664||Cookies are used to offer you a better browsing experience and to analyze our traffic.

“The Chinese ambassador received satellite image of floating objects in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify,” Hishammuddin Hussein said at a press conference two weeks after the flight went missing.

The object China photographed is 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide, or 74 feet by 43 feet, the minister said.

The country provided the satellite image to Australia, which ramped up its search of the plane this week.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority announced that it had plotted the position of the object and found that it fell within the area it searched on Saturday. Officials said the object was not spotted in the search.

Only a number of small objects, including a wooden pallet, were sighted during Saturday’s search.

The search for the plane will resume on Sunday, Australia’s government said.

Beijing has already dispatched two planes to Australia and will send two more ships to join five already searching the southern corridor, CNN reported.

According to Malaysian officials, the search area expanded to an area of about 10,500 square nautical miles on Saturday.###4667||Empty###4668||Empty###4669||You are the owner of this article.###4670||

Eric Tucker and Tom Krisher, The Associated Press





WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.

The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker's disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.

"Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues ... Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress," Holder told a news conference.

Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, "we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust," said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. "In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first."

Toyota said it had "made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totalling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totalling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

Chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart wants to pay more for used games than any other buyer.

Beginning March 26, customers at 3,100 stores will be able to trade in video games played on Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo consoles. The credit can be applied immediately toward the purchase of anything sold at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online.

Video games will be refurbished and sent back to stores in new packaging and sold as used games. Wal-Mart expects to start selling used games sometime this summer, depending on the inventory it collects, Mac Naughton said.

GameStop has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” GameStop said in a prepared statement. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Used games still represent about 30 percent of GameStop’s annual sales and about 40 percent of its profits.

Many other retailers exited or downplayed the video game segment because the industry seemed to be moving rapidly toward digital gaming. GameStop built up its digital business, strengthened its used business and amassed 30 million PowerUp reward program members.

Successful launches of the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 during the holiday shopping season signaled that gamers still aren’t willing to give up their hardware and software.

GameStop promoted its buyback program during the launch of the pricey new consoles. Trade-ins allowed customers to get a break on the consoles, which cost $500 and $400 and weren’t being discounted.

Best Buy also buys used games.

Wal-Mart is trying to build up its used business now because the Xbox One and PS4 are expected to have strong sales over the next couple of years.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,” Mac Naughton said. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

There are almost 1 billion games sitting around in homes, and 8 out of 10 are not being played, said Laura Phillips, senior vice president of entertainment for Wal-Mart U.S. “Customers are sitting on cash they can use at Wal-Mart,” Phillips said.

Wal-Mart recently entered the used-merchandise business, selling everything from refurbished TVs to smartphones.

GameStop shares retreated as much a 6 per cent in morning trading, making it one of top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said yesterday its trade-in service would accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp's PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360, and customers could in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam's Club.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US, said in a statement.

The move would see Wal-Mart take on retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, and GameStop, which also offered trade-in programmes for used videogames. Games of the type are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would not likely lose market share, it would be forced to enter into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

"We know that WMT (Walmart) "invests in price" ... and we expect GME (Gamestop) will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share," Schick wrote in a note to clients.

Microsoft shares were up 4.3 per cent and analysts at Barclays hiked the stock's price target to $44 from $43.

It is Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s new effort to capture a different and growing element of the retail market.

The newspaper described the small store is a "hybrid format--part traditional convenience store, part grocery, part quick-serve restaurant." The site also features six canopied gasoline dispensers.

Walmart partnered with Bentonville Butcher & Deli to operate a deli counter in the back of the store. There are soda and frozen drink fountains, milk shakes and full coffee bar.

Refrigerated food-to-go includes market fresh pizzas, sandwiches and other meat entrees. There is also fresh fruit and a Greek yogurt smoothie station.

The store offers beer and wine in a walk-in cooler, as well as frozen food.

The small grocery component includes five aisles with hundreds of packaged foods and nonfood items from breakfast cereals to dog food and diapers. Shirley's Flowers has a fresh flowers kiosk near the front doors next to the Hallmark Cards. The store also has Krispy Kreme doughnuts, magazines, books and an ATM, as well as interior and exterior seating areas.

The center of the store closely resembles a traditional c-store with cashiers in a corral with a wide range of tobacco products.

The retailer is testing an online grocery delivery service with a similar name, WalmartToGo.com, said a report by Arkansas Business. Wal-Mart spokesperson Deisha Barnett told the newspaper that the Walmart to Go c-store is a "one-off project."

"It's a convenience store test concept," she said. "We're not planning any more across the country."

Walmart currently operates 20 small-format Walmart Express stores, approximately 15,000 square feet in size. The units have performed well, it said, and the company is expanding them beyond the initial three-market pilot. The company also is testing several 2,500-square-foot, college-based convenience store-type retail outlets called Walmart on Campus.

Bill Simon, Walmart U.S. president and CEO recently said that its "small-store expansion … including fresh, pharmacy and fuel, will help us usher in the next generation of retail." In what industry observers have pegged as a strategy to quell competition from the dollar-store channel, Wal-Mart has announced that it is significantly accelerating its capital plan for U.S. small-store format openings for the current fiscal year.

Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores has 10,942 stores under 71 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 10 countries, with fiscal-year 2014 sales of more than $473 billion.###4678||Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky Bloomberg News

Shares fell about 12% on Friday.



TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, said a lot of ipeople bought Symantec because it had a new CEO and was involved in online security. "How can you miss?" was the thinking, he said.

However, Symantec didn't "change with the times" and was focusing on personal computers rather than mobile.

Pointing to FireEye (FEYE), Cramer said that a stock can do very well in this industry when it delivers but when it offered 14 million shares in a secondary offering, FireEye shares suffered.

Cramer admitted he "fears" that when the insiders in Symantec start selling their shares, the stock will suffer. He also thinks this will happen to any company going public now.

"Insider selling is what wrecked 2000," Cramer concluded, and it can wreck these companies, too.

Symantec also reiterated its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which was previously provided on January 29, 2014:





Revenue of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, compared to $1.748 billion in the year-ago period.

GAAP operating margin of 18.0 to 19.5 percent compared to 14.6 percent in the year-ago period.

Ankara has found the internet difficult to silence over allegations of corruption. Hours after Turkey’s government moved to block access to Twitter, Turkish citizens struck back – on the social media network itself.

Some circulated a manipulated picture of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, sinking his teeth into the blue bird that serves as the network’s mascot. They were not alone: the number of tweets sent after the midnight ban rose 140 per cent over normal levels, according to data provided by analytics firm Brandwatch.



Dodging the ban

Twitter sent out mobile numbers that allowed Turkish consumers to keep using its service. In another technical fix against the ban, Turkish downloads of Hotspot Shield, the world’s most popular virtual private network service, rose to 270,000 on Friday – from a daily average of 7,000.

The Turkish users’ defiance and the sheer scale of their activity suggest no immediate end to the battering Mr Erdogan has suffered in cyberspace.

Seeking to silence allegations of corruption against him and his government in the run-up to local elections on March 30th, he has removed some 7,000 policemen from their posts and boosted Ankara’s powers over judges and prosecutors.

But the internet has proved harder to handle. A formal corruption investigation has stalled, Twitter and YouTube have been used to circulate apparently incriminating voice recordings of Mr Erdogan and his circle – including some he has acknowledged as authentic.

Yet more explosive leaks are expected ahead of this month’s elections – according to one rumour, more revelations will come on March 25th.

But if Turkey’s Twitter ban was intended to thwart the dissemination of such allegations, it has backfired spectacularly.

“Erdogan is constantly on the run now. I don’t think he has time to think,” said Soli Ozel at Kadir Has university in Istanbul. “He is trying to keep the scandal as muted as possible at all costs, but he can’t control the technology. Instead, he is fuelling the fire of suspicion and making everyone anticipate what, if anything, will come out on the 25th.”

Mr Erdogan took aim at Twitter, saying he would “root out” the microblogging service for national security reasons. But he failed to account for Turkey’s predilection for social networks – a response, many say, to a cowed media – which means Twitter has greater penetration among web users here than in any other country.

Even President Abdullah Gul, who signed a Bill increasing government control over the internet, tweeted his opposition to the measure.



Free speech

Before long, the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the UK government, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and many other non-governmental and international bodies had sent tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech. Celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Richard Branson, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood piled in.

The Turkish bar association filed a criminal complaint against the ban, which it said was illegal. As sporadic Twitter service returned, mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure, supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy.

The government says it was done as Twitter had failed to respect such court complaints; a lawyer for Twitter was in Ankara for meetings yesterday.

“These steps are very crucial for the Turkish legal system,” said Selin Erciyas, at Mehmet Gun & Partners, an Istanbul law firm. “We will see if there is a true objective legal system or whether it is just Erdogan that decides things in court.”

– (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2014)###4686||Empty###4687||Empty###4688||MUNICH--German luxury car maker BMW AG gave a bullish outlook for profit and sales this year, but warned that its forecasts depend on political and economic stability.

Norbert Reithofer, chief executive officer of the Munich-based BMW automotive group, on Wednesday reaffirmed the company's target to sell more than two million cars for the first time this year. Boosted by higher car sales, Bayerische Motoren Werke's pretax earnings should show "clear growth" in 2014, he said.

Mr. Reithofer's upbeat outlook contained a considerable caveat in light of the continuing political uncertainty in Europe over Russia's planned annexation of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine and Europe's still weak economic recovery. Car sales in the European Union have risen nearly 7% so far this year, but industry executives remain cautious in their outlook for the full year.

"Just like you, we are monitoring the political and economic developments in the world," Mr. Reithofer said in a prepared speech. "Everything is fragile. Things could change at any moment."

As previously reported, BMW sold 1.96 million cars world-wide last year, an increase of 6.4%, and achieved sales of EUR76 billion, down 1% from a year earlier. BMW's net profit rose 4.5% to EUR5.34 billion last year, a record high for the automotive group.

Much of BMW's growth is coming from China and the U.S.

In 2013, BMW built 300,000 cars in its Spartenburg, South Carolina plant. With demand increasing, Mr. Reithofer reiterated that BMW is considering expanding capacity at the plant. No decision has been made.

In China, BMW expanded capacity to 300,000 cars a year last year and is already making preparations to expand further to 400,000. The German car group will also build a new engine plant with its joint venture partner Brilliance. The plant is expected to open in 2016.

###4693||Empty###4694||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec fired chief executive Steve Bennett on Thursday US time, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell as much as 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company said the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Symantec is facing stiff competition from nimbler network security software makers such as Palo Alto Networks and Checkpoint Systems.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you just add this to the list," Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for the fourth quarter.

The California-based company's shares closed at US$20.90 on Thursday US time on the Nasdaq.###4695||Empty###4696||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

"The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them," the bank said in a statement.



The bank added, that the cardholders can still withdraw cash from the ATMs of Rossiya and its partner banks Sobinbank and the United Payment System.



The bank is allegedly closed to the Kremlin regime and is subjected to international sanctions over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.



The news signalled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia.



Earlier sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials.



Sobinbank, part of the Rossiya banking group, said, quoted by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, that its call centers had been swamped by customers who were abroad and suddenly found their cards were not working.



Also affected was the Russian SMP Bank, majority owned by brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who were named as individuals in the US sanctions list.



“All other operations, including the issuance of deposits and making payments remain unaffected and without any restrictions,” SMP Bank said in a statement, adding that it has no assets in the United States.###4701||The crew of one of two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft used in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 walk away from their plane in Perth.

France has provided new satellite data showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.

The new information, given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia, shows "potential objects" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

It was one of the last calls made to or from the mobile of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah in the hours before his Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur, the Mail Online reported.

Anyone buying a pay-as-you-go SIM card in Malaysia has to fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number.

In this case, police traced the number to a shop selling SIM cards in Kuala Lumpur.

They found that it had been bought "very recently" by someone who gave a woman's name - but was using a false identity.

There has been speculation that Zaharie, 53, was linked to anti-government protest groups in Malaysia.

Everyone else who spoke to the pilot on his phone in the hours before the flight took off has already been interviewed.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud", Royal Australian Air Force flight Lieutenant Russell Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.



Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."



Details on the French data were not immediately released. The statement from Malaysia called the information "new satellite images", while a statement from France's Foreign Ministry said "radar echoes taken by a satellite" had located floating debris but made no mention of imagery.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is leading the search in waters off Australia, declined to offer details about the information from France. The authority did not respond to multiple requests by The Associated Press for access to the data.



"Any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans," AMSA said.

But a Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data consisted of radar echoes captured on Friday and converted into fuzzy images that located objects about 930 kilometres north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured on Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22m by 13m, said the official, who declined to be identified because he isn't authorised to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.



Information about the new data emerged as authorities coordinating the search, which is being conducted about 2500km southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours. It was spotted on Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a New Zealand air force Orion dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.



"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue co-ordination centre. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

Royal New Zealand Air Force Air Commodore Mike Yardley said there had been no sightings of interest. The only thing the crew saw was seaweed. A picture of something floating in the southern Indian Ocean, as seen from the New Zealand Orion was released.

The sighting of a wooden pallet raised hopes. While they were commonly used in shipping, they could also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.



AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.



"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."



Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of Sunday night.



Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether flight MH370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared, but did not immediately respond to the email.



An official with Malaysia Airlines said on Sunday night that the flight was carrying wooden pallets but provided no further details, including the number of pallets.



When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they first found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.



The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Big box retailer Walmart has announced that on March 26 it will begin accepting trade-ins of used video games for store credit that will allow customers to purchase anything in the store. Over 3,100 Walmart locations will participate in the program, though Sam's Club and neighborhood market locations will be unable to accept used games. That said, this credit will be usable at any Walmart location, and will even allow customers to purchase items online.

What's significant about this trade-in program is that it doesn't just apply to games. What that means is that although Walmart might not have as large a selection of games as Gamestop, it's still likely to take a fair chunk out of that retailer's bottom line, particularly if it offers customers a better deal for their old titles.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

“We know that WMT “invests in price” ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,” Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.###4708||This will appear next to all of your comments

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.

NEW YORK | The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.



Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.



The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.



Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.



The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.



Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.'s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for "technological answers to saving them money and time."



Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.



The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's "every day low price" model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.



As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.



Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.



Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.



Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.



The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.



The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.



Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.



Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.



As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.



"They're doing the work for me," said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. "The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away."###4715||What would you get if you combined your income tax filing with the health history form you fill out at your doctor’s office?

One way to find them is to click the “Find Local Help” button on HealthCare.gov. By typing in your ZIP code, you can see what groups and institutions have federal grants to provide help.

Another route would be to call your local hospital. Many are offering enrollment guidance themselves, or know where to find such help nearby. Check njha.com/reform to see a list of sign-up sessions scheduled between now and March 31, the deadline to purchase private insurance through the federal exchange.

There are two enrollment offices in the northern part of the state that work directly with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If you have a complicated set of circumstances, it may be worth the ride to consult them. The Edison enrollment assistance center is at 1719 State Route 27, Festival Plaza, (732-484-9710). The Wayne center is at 1211 Hamburg Turnpike, Suite 301, (201-414-0465).

Both centers are open seven days a week.

Another option is to consult a local insurance broker who handles health insurance. While agents typically handle small business accounts, they can handle individuals as well, said David Oscar, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters. Their help is free to clients; agents ultimately get paid by the insurance carrier for sending business its way.

You can locate a nearby agent at njahu.org.

Even with the help of a trained professional, the experts say to plan on spending at least 90 minutes on the process — longer if you’re enrolling on behalf of a large family.

The most difficult part may be “reading the questions thoroughly and not reading them too fast,” said Oscar. Some of the questions are silly, he said, such as the one asking about the pregnancy status of all females in the household, including infants.

That’s why it helps to gather all the information you need before you apply, whether that application is by phone (800-318-2596), computer (HealthCare.gov), or face-to-face:

• Not just your Social Security number, but the numbers of everyone you’re signing up for, including small children. (You don’t need proof of your Social Security number; you just need to know what it is.)

• If you are a permanent resident, bring your green card.

• If you are switching from a policy you have but don’t like, bring that policy number and company name.

• Something that helps document your income, whether it’s your taxes for last year, or better yet, recent pay stubs. You will be required to state your best guess for what you’ll earn in 2014, and the more accurate your prediction, the better, say tax advisers.###4716||Photo by AMSA via Getty Images

The big news from overnight in the search for MH370, via the Associated Press:

Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in northeast Ohio.

An Australian search and rescue official says that planes have been sent to check on two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight that were spotted on satellite imagery in the Indian Ocean about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth.

But John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority cautioned Thursday against expectations that this may help solve the mystery of the plane that went missing with 239 people on board nearly two weeks ago. Young told reporters, "We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sited close-up."

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. One of the objects spotted was said to be 24 meters (nearly 80 feet) in length and the other 5 meters (about 15 feet) long. Both were in an area that officials described as being about a four-hour flight off Australia's southwestern coast.

The satellite images represent the first significant new lead investigators have had in days, but there is still plenty of reason for caution. This search has already contained more than its fair share of red herrings, including (most notably in this particular case) satellite images released by China in the days after the jetliner went missing that appeared to show debris floating roughly in the area the 777 disappeared from air traffic control radar. A search of that area, however, turned up nothing and investigators have since shifted their attention to the opposite side of the Malaysian peninsula and well beyond.

The new images were actually recorded four days ago—on March 16—but were somewhat lost in the shuffle given the massive scale of the area being searched. "Due to the volume of imagery being searched, and the detailed process of analysis that followed," the info wasn't brought to the attention of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority until Thursday morning local time, according to an official statement from the agency.



Australia quickly dispatched four planes to investigate the area in question—described as a 23,000 square-kilometer area about 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth—but the search produced no debris sightings by the end of the day local time. (The fact that it's a four-hour flight out and a four-hour one back isn't making things any easier for the planes doing the sweep.) The search will begin again Friday morning, according to officials.

Chancellor George Osborne's facelift for the £1 coin could have unintended consequences for the UK's economy.

Designed to tackle counterfeiting in the UK, the new 12-sided coin should be much harder to forge than existing currency.

The Royal Mint estimates that three per cent of all £1 coins are fakes, or £45m worth.

Some warn that this counterfeiting - in a demand-driven recession - is less of a problem that it might seem.

Ben Southwood, head of macro policy at the Adam Smith Institute, says that production of fake coins means higher aggregate demand, less unemployment, and a narrower output gap.

"While the Bank of England kept policy too tight, counterfeiters were doing their job for them," says Southwood.

But counterfeiting is merely a partial band-aid for the Bank of England's unwillingness to support aggregate demand.

Southwood recommends that as Osborne closes down the counterfeiting route to buoying aggregate demand, "he should open up a more legitimate one, telling the Bank of England to ignore inflation and switch to targeting nominal income or wages."###4719||Putin laughs in the face of Western sanctions by asking for his £5,000 monthly salary to be transferred to the Russian bank singled out for punishment

Opened Rossiya Bank account - earmarked for sanctions by U.S.

Putin's £4,500 monthly salary will now be paid into the bank

Chechnya President Ramzan Kadyrov also opened an account there



Ukrainian PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk hit out at Putin the 'armed gangster'



Vladimir Putin yesterday mocked the West's sanctions against Russia - as eastern Europe began boosting its defences amid fears of further Kremlin land grabs.



Putin dismissively brushed aside concerns raised by Washington, Brussels and London and inked Crimea's switch to rule by Moscow in defiance of international objections.



He also laughed off punishments imposed by the U.S. and EU on his closest friends and their banks.



Putin opened an account in blacklisted St Petersburg-based Rossiya Bank, which was singled out for sanctions by America, and ordered that his monthly £4,500 salary be paid into the bank.



'I have ordered the administrative department to transfer my salary there,' he said.



Scroll down for video

Vladamir Putin today said he would be transferring his salary to Russian Bank Rossiya Bank - despite the fact that the U.S. has said that it plans to sanction the organisation

The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, joined him. 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it,' he said.



And Putin joked in abusive slang that a gaggle of oligarchs including Yuriy Kovalchuk and Gennadiy Timchenko - seen by the U.S. as his 'cronies' and subjected to sanctions in support of Kiev - are 'typical moskali', bearing Ukrainian names.



But the Ukrainian premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday said he was signing an EU association deal - the first step to membership - to protect his country from 'armed gangster' Putin.



He insisted 'Russia has undermined the global security system.



'Russia has started to behave like an armed gangster in Europe, therefore we should find an adequate answer to stop an international crime because this is an international crime.'



In slashing a gas subsidy to Ukraine, he was using 'energy as a new nuclear weapon,' he said.

Poland responded by announcing that it will speed up the £3 billion purchase of a missile defence system, with Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz calling the turmoil in neighbouring Ukraine the 'biggest crisis' since escaping the Soviet noose 25 years ago.



President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov (right) also transferred his money to the sactioned bank. He said: 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it'

France yesterday offered to send four fighter jets to the Baltic states and to ensure twice weekly AWACS patrols.



Yesterday 32 Crimean Tatars has requested refugee status in Poland following Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula.



Meanwhile, Ukraine was plunged into a corruption crisis amid claims that officials in the new government maybe complicit in an alleged £2.5 billion embezzlement scandal involving the Naftogaz state oil and gas company.



Naftogaz chief Yevgen Bakulin is suspected of heading a 'criminal group' whose members include other senior current and former Ukrainian government members.



Bakulin was detained last night after the corruption claims by Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.###4720||Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced on Tuesday a new program that will allow gamers to trade in used video games for store credit. The world’s largest retailer said the game trade-in program will begin at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores on March 26. Customers will be able to buy the refurbished games in those stores and online later this year.

Currently, Wal-Mart offers trade-ins online, but only in a limited capacity.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

The program will allow customers to exchange used games for store credit -- but not cash. Wal-Mart said the trade-in games will be sent out to be refurbished and “made available for purchase in like-new condition.”

Games eligible for trade-in must be in their original packaging, and they will be evaluated for damages by electronics department staff. Customers will receive a specific trade-in value for each game, which they can use immediately at any Walmart or Sam’s Club store, or online at Walmart.com and SamsClub.com. USA Today reported that values will vary by game “from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.”

Customers will be able to purchase pre-owned, used video games in stores and online later this year. Games will be marked “Certified Pre-Owned,” or “fully refurbished and in like-new condition.”

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” Mac Naughton said.###4721||Empty###4722||The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) released their joint critical systems review of Boeing’s 787-8 Dreamliner Wednesday. The review was initiated in January 2013, after a series of problems with the plane’s electrical system and batteries surfaced and eventually caused the entire fleet of 787s to be grounded for three months.

The review team consisted of six FAA officials and seven Boeing employees, who spent six months validating the 787’s certification process. The review committee’s report stated:

The CSRT [critical systems review team] determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane’s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification.

The review team made four recommendations:

Boeing should establish a means to ensure suppliers identify program risks and complementary mitigation plans. Boeing should continue to implement and mature the gated design and production processes with sufficient resources for development programs, and to minimize risks throughout the life cycle of the program. (“Gated” design establishes a series of programmatic criteria (gates) that must be met before moving to the next development phase.) Boeing should ensure suppliers are fully aware of their responsibilities, including integration responsibilities and accountability for subtier performance. Boeing should require its suppliers to follow industry standards for the training, qualification and certification of supplier personnel performing Boeing-required (non-FAA) inspections.

The panel also recommended that the FAA make three changes to its policy and guidance documents.

The CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane division said:

The findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise.

Boeing stock was down about 0.1% in the noon hour Wednesday, at $123.89 in a 52-week range of $83.80 to $144.57.###4723||WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than five years after the financial crisis struck, the biggest U.S. banks are better able to withstand a severe recession than at any time since the meltdown, the Federal Reserve has determined.

Results of the Fed's annual "stress tests" showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks' financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year's tests.

"The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago," said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The banks' stronger positions should enable them to pursue business plans, pay dividends to shareholders, raise capital from investors and expand services to customers, said Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed's stress tests' "severely adverse" scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That's down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year's tests — even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks' progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.

The 30 banks were also tested on how well they would withstand severe downturns in Europe and in Asian countries like China and Japan.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Nearly all U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in assets were in the group of 30 that were tested. Together they account for some $13.5 trillion in assets — about 80 percent of U.S. banks' total amount. Twelve of the 30 banks were added to the testing roster for the first time this year.

Most of the 30 banks tested, along with hundreds of others, received federal bailouts during the financial crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.

Zions, the only bank to fall short this year, is based in Salt Lake City. It slid to a loss in the fourth quarter as it booked hefty charges related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items.

Zions said in a statement that its performance on the stress tests was worse than it expected mostly due to significantly higher commercial real estate losses, significantly greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue. The bank said that it will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Ally said it was pleased that the test results "recognized the substantial transformation that the company has undergone since last year."

The Fed concluded last March that Wall Street powerhouses JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needed better plans for coping with a severe downturn and gave the banks until September to revise them. The two banks were allowed to increase their dividends and buy back their stock on condition they submitted revised capital plans that satisfied the Fed.

At the same time, the Fed approved requests outright from 14 of the 18 banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

But the Fed forbade Ally and BB&T Corp. from making any dividend increases and share buybacks they may have been seeking.

Next Wednesday, the Fed will announce whether it has approved each bank's request, if one has been made, to raise dividends for shareholders. Its decisions will be based on how each bank would fare in a severe recession if it increased its payout.

Raising dividends costs money. The government doesn't want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.

The other banks tested were: American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Comerica Inc., Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp, M&T Bank Corp., Northern Trust Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., Santander Holdings USA Inc., State Street Corp., U.S. Bancorp and UnionBanCal Corp.

The service will begin starting March 26, according to Reuters.

The service means Walmart will accept games for a number of consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360.

Customers who take part in a trade in will receive store credit, but not cash, at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online, the company said, according to Reuters.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement, according to Reuters.

Other retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, and Target also offer trade-in programs for used videogames as well.

All traded-in videogames will be refurbished before being made available for purchase to buyers, according to Walmart.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," said Naughton.###4725||Among the companies expected to actively trade in Tuesday’s session are GameStop Corp., Hertz Corp. and James River Coal Co.###4726||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

GameStop's unique selling point has always been the fact that it is the one big chain where you can go and trade in games, so does this mean that we're watching the end of an era? Probably not.

As it turns out, a handful of big chains have already tried to get in on the used-game market. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been accepting games for years now, and they've taken very little from GameStop. Analysts have said that they "do not believe Wal-Mart will have a material impact on GameStop's dominant used video game market share" and that "[history] suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share." In classic market style, GameStop's stock fell 5% on the news.

Why GameStop can hold it down

There are two main reasons that GameStop has been able to defend its moat. First, the company is, ostensibly, staffed with video game fans. When video gamers are looking for someone to talk to, they head to GameStop, where the in-depth discussion never ends. Just kidding: No one talks to employees anymore. What do you think this is, 1950?

The real reason GameStop can hold off Best Buy is that it generally has a bigger selection of games, and the value you get for trading in doesn't fluctuate enough between the two to drive business to Best Buy. If you're going to get the same amount for your game but you've got a broader selection of things to buy at GameStop, you're probably going to go there.

Wal-Mart is likely going to face the same headwinds as Amazon has. Amazon -- a company that competes on price for everything else -- has done, at best, a mediocre job of paying players for used games. Wal-Mart's plan is to take used games for store credit, without selling used games until they build up a collection. So for the first few months, you can walk in, leave your game, get some Wal-Mart credit -- the company won't give cash for games -- and then come back in a few months to buy a different used game.

GameStop isn't out of the woods

Just because Wal-Mart isn't going to crush GameStop doesn't mean that GameStop is fine. The company is still grappling with the increase in digital sales and the fact that the future is going to be all digital. While that time is still a ways off, GameStop needs to have a plan in place ahead of time. The good news is, if you believe that GameStop will get its act together -- I'm still on the fence -- today's fall would offer you a nice discount to get into GameStop. On the other hand, if you think it's all on its way to pear-shaped, maybe now is the time to cash out on those old Sonic games.###4730||Empty###4731||Citi Bike honchos need tens of millions of dollars to save the struggling bicycle-share program — but Mayor de Blasio said Friday that it won’t come from the wallets of New York City taxpayers.

“At this point, city budget money is not on the table,” he said. “We will collaborate with them to help them find ways to be more efficient and more effective.”

The program was launched last year with a promise from Mayor Michael Bloomberg that it would not require public funding.

But lawsuits, glitches and a lack of use have made Citi Bike’s first year a rough ride — and the program needs a small fortune to stay in business, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Alta Bicycle Share, Citi Bike’s parent company, could generate revenue by raising the annual membership fee of $95, but a City Hall source said that can’t happen until it fixes its operations.

Department of Transportation officials said that rather than raise rates, the program needs to capitalize on all the publicity it got in its first year to win new sponsors as well as private financing.

“If you’re sitting on the story of the year in New York City, you have a lot of opportunities,” a DOT official said.

Brooklyn City Councilman Brad Lander left the door open to public funding.

“Every other form of transportation receives some public subsidy,” Lander said, noting all other cities with bike-share programs subsidize the service.

He said he spoke to DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg about using taxpayer money and she “seemed open to it.”

Asked about this claim, a DOT spokesman referred to the mayor’s earlier statement.

Alta Bicycle Share said it was seeking outside investors.

Manhattan City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, who heads the Transportation Committee, said marketing could expand Citi Bike.

“City dollars should be a last resort only if we are unable to gather interest from new private partnerships,” he said.

He plans to introduce legislation next week that will require Alta to release its financial data.

Trottenberg said she’s confident Citi Bike would resolve its problems and even expand. It has a six-year contract with the city.

“We all know Citi Bike has been tremendously popular with New Yorkers,” she said. “But there have been significant financial and operational issues, including redistribution of bikes to where the riders are and technology issues.”

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Mar.20, 2014 - Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) today announced that its board of directors has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. This appointment follows the termination of Steve Bennett as the company's president and chief executive officer and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors. A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. On behalf of Symantec's board, chairman Daniel Schulman said, "We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness.

The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market. By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader." As interim president and chief executive officer, Mr. Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

NEW YORK � The �everyday low price� king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

Wal-Mart said it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products with those of its competitors. The world�s largest retailer began offering the feature that�s called �Savings Catcher� on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers such as Target and Best Buy are offering to match the lower prices of rivals � but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart�s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn�t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit-card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it�s successful, others might follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.�s U.S. discount division, said shoppers are looking for �technological answers to saving them money and time.�

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program will be rolled out nationwide, said it�s hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Walmart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart�s �everyday low price� model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper.

On top of that, the retailer�s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.###4735||Empty###4736||Graeme Smith of Mondi addresses the goals for sustainable packaging and the need for the whole value chain to embrace the responsibility for bringing through a new generation of resource-efficient, recyclable solutions. more###4737||REUTERS: Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10% in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," the company said.

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5% organic growth and higher than 30% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5% revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5% decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company's sales team.

Symantec had been reorganising its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software-maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list," Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

The Mountain View, California-based company's shares closed at US$20.90 on Thursday on the Nasdaq. – Reuters

###4742||Empty###4743||The safe-haven yen stayed below a recent peak against the dollar and the euro stood firm on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea's weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar held steady at 101.76 yen, staying above a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday. The dollar gained some support against the yen after US Treasury yields rose on Monday as safety demand for government debt receded.

The euro edged up 0.1 % to $1.3934, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit on Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

Against the yen, the euro edged up 0.1 % to about 141.79 yen.

After Sunday's referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and the European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

"In immediate focus is Russian president Putin's speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

"But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving US government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar," he said.

PUTIN SPEECH President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia's State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow's involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia's armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

One possible resistance level for the dollar against the yen now lies around 102.30 yen, said Philip Wee, senior currency economist for DBS Bank in Singapore.

The dollar's 20-day moving average now lies roughly around 102.30 yen, while the 100-day moving average comes in slightly above that level, around 102.38 yen.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8729.

The dollar had hit a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8698 against the Swiss franc last week on trading platform EBS, but has since pulled up from that trough as investor risk aversion ebbed.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against six major currencies, was at 79.355, clinging above a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the US consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar's likely direction.

Investing.com - German economic sentiment deteriorated sharply in March, dampening optimism over the health of the euro zone's largest economy, industry data showed on Tuesday.

In a report, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment tumbled by 9.1 points to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to fall by 2.7 points to 53.0 in March.

The Current Conditions Index improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February, missing expectations for an increase to 52.0.

Meanwhile, the index of euro zone economic sentiment dropped to 61.5 in March from 68.5 in February, worse than expectations for a decline to 67.3.

On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.

Following the release of that data, the euro added to losses against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD shedding 0.22% to trade at 1.3892, compared to 1.3913 ahead of the data.

Meanwhile, European stock markets remained lower.

The review, which was initiated by the FAA after a battery fire aboard a 787 in Boston in January 2013, encompassed the entire plane, not specifically the battery issue.

It made seven recommendations for further improvements in Boeing processes and the agency's oversight, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said.

The Boston fire and another battery incident in Japan several days later prompted regulators to ground the plane for three-and-a-half months last year. The plane has also suffered a series of mishaps with brakes, fuel lines, electrical panels, hydraulics and other systems.

Boeing redesigned the battery, charger and containment system to ensure battery fires would not put the plane at risk, and the Dreamliner was returned to service. The cause of the battery problems has not been determined and is the subject of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation.###4752||Tech Stocks New Lows: China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), Liquid Holdings Group Inc.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration proposed new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

"Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can't finish, we won't shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don't have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can't get coverage again until next year," HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare's six-month enrollment period. Most of those bug have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website's capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.###4755||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Business News###4761||Less than two years after being hired by Symantec Corp., CEO Steve Bennett was ousted by the security giant's board Thursday, but according to industry observers familiar with Symantec, its struggles to define and execute a security product strategy go far deeper than any one executive.

They don't know who they are, they don't know what they want to do, and that's infiltrating all the way through their organization. J.J. Thompson,

CEO, Rook Security

Much of Bennett's time at Big Yellow was spent implementing what he termed the Symantec 4.0 strategy, which mostly focused on paring back products, services and staff. Though Symantec's stock price more than doubled during his first year, Bennett was unable to maintain that momentum; the stock price has dipped 15% in the past year. Similarly, sales of Symantec's line of consumer products, headlined by its Norton-branded endpoint antimalware technology, declined 2.8% in 2013, a foreboding statistic considering how closely linked the company's brand is with traditional endpoint security.

Chris Rodriguez, network security senior industry analyst at San Antonio, Texas-based consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, said that while Symantec has products in emerging security product segments, such as the high-growth mobile space, the company has struggled to compete against a myriad of upstarts. In mobile, for instance, Rodriguez said security technology from rivals Avast Software and Lookout Inc. is just as effective and often much cheaper, if not free.

'Bloated' Symantec facing deep-rooted issues Despite those obvious headwinds, a variety of experts told SearchSecurity that the root of Symantec's issues runs much deeper than Bennett, and that much more than a new CEO will be needed to steer the company in the right direction. Kevin McDonald, executive vice president for Irvine, Calif.-based managed IT services provider Alvaka Networks, said that the security industry has largely recognized that "Symantec was synonymous with bloated," from the company's software to its staff. While calling the decision to fire Bennett a "mind-blower," McDonald admitted the company may not have innovated enough to stave off emerging powerhouse rivals such as FireEye Inc. that are focused on detecting advanced attacks at the network level. Still, he predicted that the next Symantec CEO would benefit greatly from the moves that Bennett made. "I felt like there was finally stability in the company and they had somebody that knew how to look at the overall operation and make it work," McDonald said. "Bottom line is I felt like Bennett was paring back some of the bloat, and then expanding in the places he felt they needed to." John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the Bethesda, Md.-based SANS Institute and the former long-time lead security analyst for Gartner Inc., said that many of the issues Bennett faced during his tenure as Symantec CEO actually had much deeper roots, going back to John W. Thompson's leadership of the company from 1999 to 2009. Pescatore said Thompson set the tone for the company as it expanded into a variety of markets beyond information security. Pescatore noted that Microsoft's entry into the antivirus market threatened Symantec's core revenue stream. That trend continued under Bennett's predecessor, Enrique Salem, with the company soon providing everything from storage services to desktop management.###4762||The Board Of Directors of Symantec Corp.

THE missing Malaysia Airlines plane went down in the Indian Ocean presumably killing all those on board, authorities said after viewing new satellite data.

Malaysia Airlines has informed the relatives of those aboard missing flight MH370 that they believe no one on the plane survived.

The following SMS message was sent to relatives: “Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived. ... we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a 1am AEDT news conference that a new analysis of satellite data showed that the missing plane plunged into the southern Indian Ocean.

Mr Najib said the Inmarsat satellite company had employed never-before used technology and found that MH370 flew along the southern corridor.

“Its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean west of Perth,” he said 17 days after MH370 disappeared enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board.

“This is a remote location far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness that I regret that I must inform you that according to this new data that MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.

“The past few weeks have been heartbreaking. I know this news must be harder still.”

The news was greeted with an outpouring of grief by the relatives of passengers, whose agonising wait to find out what happened is now apparently over.

Relatives of Chinese passengers, who were the overwhelming majority of those on the plane, were called to a hotel near the airport in Beijing to hear the announcement. Afterward, they filed out of a conference room in heart-wrenching grief.

One woman collapsed and fell on her knees, crying “My son! My son!”

The overnight developments came after Prime Minster Tony Abbott announced that two “objects” were located by a RAAF P3 Orion in the search for MH370.

Mr Abbott told Parliament the first object was grey or green and circular and the second was orange and rectangular.

Distraught family members of those on board were being booked on charter flights to take them to Perth to be near the expected salvage operation.

News_Image_File: Bearer of bad news ... Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak after his press conference.

HMAS Success is in the vicinity of the possible debris, about 2500km southwest of Perth, and hopes to be there within hours to recover the objects.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority emergency response division general manager John Young said the P3 Orion had to leave before the HMAS Success arrived last night and it was possible the ship would have to wait until the first light of morning to find the objects.

MH370 WAS CO-PILOT’S FIRST 777 FLIGHT WITHOUT MINDER

“Relocation is proving difficult. That is partially a function of the poor visibility and the fact that the aircraft are a long way apart. It is quite difficult to get the next aircraft or the next ship into the spot to take over the watching where the object is because they are all at the end of their endurance and have to leave,” he said.

“You may find that we will be doing this for maybe three or four more days before we are confident that we have either found all of the objects there, or if they are there we simply can’t find them. And that’s the plan.”

News_Image_File: Searching for answers ... HMAS Success is nearby and will be there within hours to recover the objects.

Earlier in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein had told a media conference that the new items had not yet been identified or linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

“Two orange objects, approximately one metre in length, and one white-coloured drum were sighted by search aircraft, but remain unidentified and have not been conclusively linked to MH370,” he said.

News_Image_File: On the way ... the commanding officer of HMAS Success, Captain Allison Norris of the Royal Australian Navy.

“HMAS Success detected two radar targets within the search area but could not locate the targets on further investigation of the area.

“Earlier today a Chinese search plane reportedly sighted objects within the Australian search area. These objects are not in the vicinity of those that were identified by Australian authorities last week.

HMAS SUCCESS CAPTAIN STEERS SHIP THROUGH HOSTILE SEAS

“A few minutes ago the (Malaysian) Prime Minister received a call from the Prime Minister of Australia who informed him that an Australian search aircraft had located two objects in the Australian search area — one circular and one rectangular.

“HMAS Success is in the vicinity and it is possible that the objects could be received within the next few hours or by tomorrow morning at the latest.”

News_Image_File: Items located ... Malaysian PM Najib Razak takes the call from Tony Abbott.

Mr Abbott said an RAAF P3 Orion located the two objects about 2.45pm AEDT.

The PM said a US Navy Poseidon, a second Australian Royal Australian Orion and a Japanese Orion are also en route to the search area.

“I caution again ... that we don’t know whether any of these objects are from MH370, they could be flotsam,’’ he told Parliament.

“Nevertheless we are hopeful that we can recover these objects soon and they will take us a step closer to resolving this tragic mystery.’’

News_Image_File: On a mission ... Prime Minister Tony Abbott says a US Navy Poseidon, a second Australian Royal Australian Orion and a Japanese Orion are also on the way to the search area.

Hishammuddin said Malaysian police have interviewed over 100 people, including the families of both the pilot and co-pilot.

“As far as the transcript is concerned, the technical committee is considering releasing it and we will keep you informed about the decision,” he said.

“The Inspector General of the Police will attend tomorrow’s press conference to answer further questions on the investigation.

“We can also confirm that MH370 was carrying wooden pallets. However, there is as yet no evidence that these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the Australian search area.”

Hishammuddin said France has now provided two lots of images of potential debris from MH370.

EXPERTS SAY NEW FINDINGS ‘COULD BE LIFE RAFTS’

Paul Edwards, former chief of staff of British Army Aviation, told Britain’s Sky News the sightings were “quite significant”.

“It is certainly encouraging because of the shape, because of the colour orange obviously, it could be from the aircraft.

“The good news is that the aircraft has spotted it and surface ships are in the area which means that quite quickly we’re going to get an Australian warship alongside to get eyes on it, and actually identify it and — if it’s small — fish it out of the sea. To me that’s quite a significant development and very encouraging.

“(As it’s only been) a short time, there’s more chance of getting there and, crucially, actually identifying it.”

Professor Chris Bellamy, from Britain’s Greenwich Maritime Institute, said the orange items could possibly be life rafts.

“I’m afraid that doesn’t give much hope that there will be anybody in the life rafts. If the plane broke up then the slides might have inflated automatically,” he told Sky News UK.

“We’re against the clock here because in the 16 or 17 days since the plane disappeared that stuff could have gone an awfully long way.”

The development comes after Chinese aircrew earlier spotted objects in the search area off Perth.

Picture: YouTubeThe official Xinhua news agency said earlier on Monday that “white and square” objects were spotted by searchers on board a Chinese Ilyushin-76 plane, which was on its way back to Perth at the time of the sighting.

US Navy P8 Poseidon was unable to relocate the objects after it was tasked to investigate the reported sightings by the Chinese aircraft at 33,000ft.

At the request of the RAAF, one Australian pilot was on board the Chinese plane to join the search.

Chinese icebreaker Xuelong changed its course and was heading towards the area.

Multiple countries are now helping in the search with new satellite images pushing the Australian-led operation towards further areas of potential debris.

Civil and military aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, the US, China and Japan are all taking part in the massive hunt for the Malaysia Airlines plane, which disappeared more than 16 days ago with 239 people on board.

After a fruitless day of searching yesterday, satellite images from France provided some fresh impetus. They were reportedly taken on Friday although few details have been released.

“Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor. Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre,” the transport ministry said in a statement in Kuala Lumpur.

While the statement from Malaysia called the information “new satellite images’’, France’s Foreign Ministry said they were “radar echoes”. It is thought the radar echoes — electronic signals — had been converted into fuzzy images.

PLANE FLEW AS LOW AS 3650 METRES BEFORE VANISHING

New evidence supports previous eyewitness accounts that the missing Malaysian airliner flew as low as 3650 metres over Malaysia before it vanished.

Military radar tracking showed the plane changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea and headed back over the peninsula towards the Straits of Malacca, according to a source close to the investigation, CNN reports.

The Boeing 777 with 239 people on board flew as low as 3650 metres feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source.

Malaysian authorities have not confirmed the CNN report.

‘PALLET’ MYSTERY

So far there has been nothing concrete found, only the grainy satellite images and a visual sighting of what appeared to be a wooden pallet which has yet to be located.

Authorities co-ordinating the search yesterday sent planes and a ship to try to “re-find’’ the pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours.

It was seen Saturday by spotters on a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate it could not find it.

News_Image_File: Objects ... satellite imagery from AMSA.

“That’s the nature of it,’’ AMSA aircraft operations co-ordinator Mike Barton said. “You only have to be off by a few hundred metres in a fast-travelling aircraft.’’

AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.

“We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry,’’ Mr Barton said. “They’re usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft ... It’s a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well.”

News_Image_File: More data ... the Chinese satellite image.

During a visit to Papua New Guinea, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the satellite images were good leads but it was “still too early to be definite”.

“But obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope — no more than hope, no more than hope — that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,” he said.

LARGE FLOATING OBJECTS

On Saturday it was revealed that a Chinese satellite had picked up what appeared to be a floating object, about 22.5 metres by 13 metres. It was seen about 120km from the position where an Australian satellite image showed what also appeared to be debris of about 24 metres in length.

One of the objects located by the French satellite on Friday was estimated to be about the same size as the object captured by the Chinese satellite (22 metres by 13 metres), according to a Malaysian official, who declined to be identified because he isn’t authorised to speak to the media.

It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

The Australian image was taken on March 16 and the Chinese image was taken on March 18.

Authorities have not yet officially revealed what date the French image was taken or what it showed.

News_Image_File: First light ... a Japanese P-3C Orion readies to join the search.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled.

They are unsure what happened next.

‘MYSTERY CALL’ DENIED

Malaysian police have denied that a mystery phone call was made to Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the missing plane.

It was reported earlier that a mystery woman called the captain before takeoff, raising fears about his motives.

The Mail Online reported that the captain’s phone records revealed he took a two-minute phone call from a woman using a mobile phone number obtained under a false identity.

But Assistant Commissioner Datin Asmawati Ahmad dismissed the report as “mere speculations”.

“Please be advised that the Royal Malaysia Police take no responsibility over the dissemination of such information which originates from unnamed and unverified sources. The news in the tabloid are mere speculations,” Asst Comm Ahmad said in a statement.

“We would like to draw your kind attention to the fact that the news was picked up from a foreign tabloid which has no exclusive rights to the details of our investigations.

“Secondly the IGP has never issued any public statement that categorically places the MH370 investigation under an act of terrorism.”

RELATIVES STILL FURIOUS

Earlier in Beijing, a Malaysian Government team had spent a marathon six hours briefing relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on the plane. It was the third meeting and comes after criticism by Chinese relatives that they were being kept in the dark about the search.

“The government wishes to reiterate its commitment and continued engagement with the relatives of those on board MH370,” the Transport Ministry said.

Some relatives were still dissatisfied, however.

“I’m so furious,’’ said one woman after the meeting in Beijing. “I watch the television every day. Very often I feel like I’m about to go insane. My emotions are all over the place. I asked the Malaysians to give the answers and they said they couldn’t.”

This weekend’s Formula One grand prix in Malaysia is also causing problems, with relatives of passengers on the missing flight forced to move hotels.

The relatives will be put up at a new hotel as the search continues. Several foreign officials, investigators and journalists are also being forced to move.###4765||BY JACOB RESNECK / GlobalPost

It's hard not to see this as having to do with the audio files Twitter users are passing around involving the prime minister and a corruption investigation.

ISTANBUL — Turkey has blocked Twitter hours after the prime minister vowed he’d “eradicate” the popular social media site.

A controversial new internet law passed last month allows the country’s telecommunications authority to order content removed within hours without a court order.

On Thursday night, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed Twitter wasn’t complying with the new law, and told a rally of thousands that he’d bring the site down.

The press advisory of the Prime Ministry later in the night clarified Erdogan's statement, arguing that Twitter officials currently "ignore" some court rulings in Turkey, which order the social media platform to "remove some links" as per the complaints filed by Turkish citizens.

"[In Erdogan's speech] it is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens," the statement said.

Reaction to the move — which came around midnight Friday local time — was swift. Major newspapers posted instructions offering simple technical workarounds to access the site.

“This is certainly a step backwards in terms of openness, transparency and the democratization process of Turkey,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Restrictions on political speech and discourse of this scale is unacceptable in any country including in Turkey.”

Twitter representatives confirmed reports that the site had been disrupted.

“We're looking into this now,” said Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler. The company’s official account offered Turkish cell phone subscribers ways to send tweets via text message.

The cause of the ban is most certainly political as Turkey prepares for March 30 local elections, seen as a key test of power for the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, now in its 11th year of rule.

Anonymous users have been posting links to YouTube of audio recordings purporting to be wiretaps that expose rampant corruption within Erdogan's inner circle.

This follows a corruption scandal that erupted Dec. 17 that implicated three cabinet ministers as well as businessmen with close ties to the prime minister’s closest associates.

The government has responded to the accusations with mass purges of the police and judiciary as well as by ordering evidence destroyed. Erdogan has said the accusations are part of a plot hatched by a former ideological ally, Fethullah Gulen — a Pennsylvania-based Islamic cleric — whom he accuses of conspiring to bring down his government.

“It was just a matter of moment for Prime Minister Erdogan and his men to decide to ban Twitter,” said Erkan Saka, an outspoken blogger and communications lecturer at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Twitter remains the main channel for freedom of expression and dissemination of corruption file leaks.”

Cyber law experts say the ban on Twitter is reminiscent of the YouTube ban that lasted for 18 months from 2008-2010.

“Certainly this is politically motivated just prior to the local elections,” Akdeniz said. “I suspect the decisions were issued prior to the PM's speech but they were only executed subsequent to his speech.”

Some of the alleged leaked wiretaps appeared to record Erdogan himself instructing media companies to censor coverage of last spring’s Gezi Park protests. Such censorship — during the protests CNN Türk famously showed a documentary on penguins in Antarctica in place of the news — is another reason why Twitter has been an important tool for Turkish citizens to share information, unrestricted, in real time. Several media companies during Erdogan’s tenure as prime minister have been fined or taken over by companies close to the government.

The recently passed internet law was panned by press freedom groups, including the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which warned it would have a chilling effect on free speech. The Turkish government claimed that the law was meant to protect children and the privacy of individuals.

Right now, the warnings from CPJ and other press freedom groups are looking prescient.

“CPJ urges the Turkish government to immediately unblock Twitter, and to respect the press freedom and free expression rights of its citizens,” said Geoffrey King, the group's internet advocacy coordinator, late Thursday.###4766||You are using an older browser version.

Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to "shake up" the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

There are 880 million video games sitting in homes today, Mac Naughton said. And according to a cited NPD report, 80 percent of these games, or more than 700 million, are rarely played. Clearly, there is a market for second-hand games, just look at GameStop's quarterly revenue for evidence of that. But why trade these games in at Wal-Mart instead of GameStop or Best Buy?

Wal-Mart's "true differentiator," Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can't compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It's credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.

Wal-Mart will accept all games (provided they are not scratched or damaged beyond repair) and refurbish them via a third-party company. These games will then be sold at stores and online with a "certified pre-owned" label on their packaging. Wal-Mart expects to have a solid inventory of secondhand games available this summer.

GameStop has its own dedicated refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas and it is this very operation that management believes sets GameStop apart from competitors. We've reached out to Gamestop for comment on this story but we have not heard back.

Just because Wal-Mart is getting into the used game market, it doesn't mean the company is backing away from new games anytime soon. The company's new release business will "remain a focus" for Wal-Mart going forward, Mac Naughton said.

But why get into the secondhand market now, in 2014, when an increasing amount of attention is paid to download services? It's a question we poised to Mac Naughton and he said Wal-Mart isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many. Still, he explained that Wal-Mart is indeed eyeing the digital market as a future growth opportunity.

"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good," he said. "We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges."

Wal-Mart's move into the used-game market will also conceivably affect publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, which do not participate in second-hand sales. We've also reached out to these companies, but have not heard back. We'll have more in the future.

Finally, though Mac Naughton never mentioned GameStop by name during the call, he said Wal-Mart's aim with its secondhand program is to "pay more than anybody else" for your old games. Of course, trade-in prices will vary, but he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.

Here's how Wal-Mart's used-game program works:###4771||Empty###4772||Empty###4773||Mannheim, Germany - German analyst and investor sentiment plunged in March at the fastest pace in nearly a year amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could weigh on Europe's largest economy, a leading survey showed on Tuesday. Mannheim-based think tank ZEW's monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

It was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

“The Crimea Crisis is weighing on expert's economic expectations for Germany,” said ZEW president Clemens Fuest.

“Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

The United States and European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.

The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0 yet still underscoring the strength of the German economy.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said the combination of emerging market turbulence earlier this year and the stand-off between Russia and the West may have a “mildly dampening impact on Germany's investment climate” and therefore on growth.

But he noted that “it would take a much more serious crisis in Ukraine to derail the recovery in Germany and the euro zone as a whole”.

The German economy, a growth locomotive in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8 percent this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.

Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January.

Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.

The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said. - Reuters###4774||Empty###4775||Breaking News Sign up to get our Breaking News stories in your inbox.

GameStop GME, -2.39% shares dropped 3.1%. The move came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.33% said it would allow customers to hand in used videogames in exchange for gift cards, which can be used in its retail stores or online. The change in policy from Wal-Mart Stores could eat away at GameStop’s dominance of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S. Wal-Mart shares are up marginally.

Microsoft MSFT, +0.61% shares rose 4.3%. Analysts at Barclays hiked the stock’s price target to $44 from $43. “Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365. It can drive better earnings growth as it transitions its ubiquitous on-premise install bases (Office and Windows Server) to its cloud platforms,” analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a report. Barclays rates the stock at overweight.

Decliners

Bloomberg GameStop shares are sliding.

NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +1.19% shares fell 3.1%. The exchange operator will host an investor’s day on March 27. Analysts from Jefferies who recently met with Nasdaq executives said the management is upbeat about Nasdaq OMX NLX, its derivatives platform.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. KORS, -3.52% slid 2.2%. Analysts at Barclays initiated coverage of the U.S. luxury sector with a positive industry outlook but Michael Kors was issued an underweight rating.

Gainers

Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ, +0.57% shares added 3.7%. The stock’s rating was raised to overweight from equalweight and its price target hiked to $38 versus $33 at Barclays on Tuesday.

SanDisk Corp. US:SNDK shares gained 4.4%. The stock will be added to the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index on March 24. The index is composed of 100 tech and telecommunications companies that regularly pay a dividend.

Shares of United States Steel Corp. X, -0.73% rose 5.3%. Analysts at Nomura lowered U.S. Steel’s first-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to 35 cents from 40 cents. The stock is rated a buy with a target price of $32. The stock is down 14% year to date.

Tickers to Watch

TSLA: Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, -2.21% rose 2.3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the stock’s six-month price target to $200, which is still below its current trading level of $239.

MSG: Madison Square Garden Co. MSG, +0.67% shares are up 0.8%. The entertainment company said Tuesday that it named Phil Jackson, one of the successful coaches in the NBA history, as president of the New York Knicks. Jackson won two championships as a player with the Knicks in 1970 and 1973. He also coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles and the Los Angeles Lakers to five titles.

HTZ: Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, +1.92% shares edged up 0.1%. The company said Tuesday it received board approval to proceed with a spinoff of its equipment-rental business that is expected to close by early next year. The new company will be called HERC, the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, while Hertz will retain the rental-car businesses. Hertz said it will receive about $2.5 billion in proceeds from the spinoff that will be used to pay down debt and fund a new $1 billion stock buyback program.

At the same time, Hertz said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed as revenue rose to $2.56 billion, with its adjusted per-share earnings coming in at 26 cents. But results fell short of analyst expectations compiled by FactSet.

THC: Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, -1.93% rose 1.6%. Analysts at Mizuho said they would be buyers of hospital stocks like Tenet due to the sector’s recent weakness on changes related to individual mandate exemption rules and earnings. “We do not think either issue will have a meaningful negative impact on our EPS estimates for the hospital group,” the analysts said in a note. Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, -0.44% climbed 3.4% and HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -1.72% advanced 2.2%.

Gul himself used Twitter to express criticism, by posting on his account that "shutdown was unacceptable".

On Thursday evening, Erdogan vowed to close the social network, through which a series of wiretapped conversation allegedly proving corruption in the cabinet have reached Turkish society.

Erdogan claimed that "everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic" and he did not care "what the international community says at all," as the BBC quoted him as saying. Hurriyet Daily News also reveals he expressed readiness to "eradicate" the micro-blogging platform.

Later on, Prime Minister's spokesman said the measure had been taken after the social media had failed to respond to a court ruling to remove links from the platform.

On Friday morning, millions of Twitter users reported they were unable to into their accounts, even though the ban later proved to be futile as many ways could be found to circumvent it.

In response President Gul, who had previously approved a controversial Internet bill allowing for the closure of websites by the Turkish Telecommunications Authority, said Friday that sites should be blocked if courts found that they had violated personal privacy. He also said he hoped the ban would not last long.

Earlier he also turned on Erdogan when the latter suggested he might crack down on social media to put an end to what he considers a plot against the government led by his rival Fethullah Gulen.

The EU expressed criticism at Turkey's move to shut down Twitter, with EU enlargement commissioner Stefan Fuele saying he was "gravely concerned." European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes even described the move as "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

Twitter did not immediately comment on the issue, but announced later it had hired a lawyer to negotiate with the Turkish Telecommunications Authority and discuss a possible legal solution.

Some Turkish ministers tried meanwhile to justify the move, with Forestry Minister Veysel Eroglu quoted by Hurriyet Daily as saying that blocking Twitter would ensure a more peaceful election and will prevent the spreading of "sensational and deceitful news".###4780||Atlassian Falls, Correction In Software Stocks Continues Into Earnings

3:02 PM ET A sell-off in Atlassian stock accelerated Friday as the correction...###4781||Istanbul: Turkish President Abdullah Gul set himself publicly at odds with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, saying that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter.

Turkey’s courts blocked access to Twitter following Erdogan’s vow, on the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, to ‘wipe out’ the service. In a defiant stand, Erdogan said he did not care what the international community had to say about it.

The prime minister, who has been in power for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing.

Gul, however, took to Twitter himself to say complete bans on social media platforms were unacceptable and to voice his hope that the block would be short-lived.

Turkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.

“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted. He said that individual internet pages should only be blocked if there is a court order on the grounds that a person’s privacy is being violated.

Gul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has remained a close ally, but he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure than the combative prime minister and their relationship has at times appeared strained.

In the run up to the elections, the president has been hesitant to openly criticise Erdogan, despite the brewing scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government. Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a corruption scandal Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content.

“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

Twitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread internet disconnections on Thursday night. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said he was ‘gravely concerned’ by the move.

“Being free to communicate and freely choose the means to do it is [a] fundamental EU value,” Fuele wrote on his Twitter account.

Turkey’s financial markets were also unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares falling 0.7 per cent and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 per cent from 11.12.

San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the social media service on Thursday. “Twitter, mwitter!”, he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.

“We will wipe out all of these,” Erdogan said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the republic of Turkey is,” he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.###4782||Empty###4783||Asia's markets were mixed in edgy trade after Russia ratcheted up tensions in Eastern Europe by formally absorbing Crimea from Ukraine.

Investors are also awaiting the end of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, hoping for some guidance from its new head Janet Yellen on her plans for interest rates.

Tokyo rose 0.36 per cent, or 51.25 points, to end at 14,462.52 and Sydney added 0.21 per cent, or 11.0 points, to 5,355.6.

But Seoul lost 0.13 per cent, or 2.53 points, to close at 1,937.68 and Shanghai finished 0.17 per cent lower, giving up 3.46 points to 2,021.73.

Hong Kong ended virtually flat, edging down 14.81 points to 21,568.69.

President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty taking Crimea into Russia's fold following a weekend referendum which Western leaders slammed as illegal.

The move comes less than three weeks after Russian troops seized control of the strategic peninsula in response to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Moscow government.

Kiev's new leaders warned the showdown had entered a "military stage" after soldiers were killed on both sides following a shootout in Crimea.

Despite the continuing crisis in Europe, traders are focused on the Fed's two-day meeting which ends later on Wednesday.

On Wall Street on Tuesday the Dow rose 0.55 per cent, the S&P 500 shot up 0.72 per cent - to end just short of a record high - and the Nasdaq climbed 1.25 per cent.

"Putin indicated he isn't seeking 'a partition of Ukraine', soothing market fears (for now) that the crisis will escalate further," National Australian Bank said.

"It gave investors the chance to start focusing on the (Fed) meeting tonight."

While analysts expect a further cut in the bank's stimulus program as the economy picks up, they also predict it will scrap its unemployment rate threshold.

The Fed previously said unemployment must fall to 6.5 per cent before it considers raising interest rates.

On currency markets the dollar traded at 101.61 yen against 101.42 yen in New York Tuesday afternoon.

The euro bought $US1.3924 and 141.49 yen compared with $US1.3932 and 141.29 yen.

The Japanese currency hardly moved after official data showed Japan's trade deficit expanded 3.5 per cent year-on-year to 800.3 billion yen ($A8.68 billion) in February.

It was the 20th straight shortfall but well down from a record deficit in January.

The median forecast by economists was for a smaller deficit of 595 billion yen, according to a poll by the leading Nikkei business daily.

Oil prices dipped. New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, was down seven cents to $US99.63 in afternoon trade, and Brent North Sea crude for May dropped 23 cents to $US106.56.

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."###4785||Empty###4786||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Big box retailer Walmart has announced that on March 26 it will begin accepting trade-ins of used video games for store credit that will allow customers to purchase anything in the store. Over 3,100 Walmart locations will participate in the program, though Sam's Club and neighborhood market locations will be unable to accept used games. That said, this credit will be usable at any Walmart location, and will even allow customers to purchase items online.

What's significant about this trade-in program is that it doesn't just apply to games. What that means is that although Walmart might not have as large a selection of games as Gamestop, it's still likely to take a fair chunk out of that retailer's bottom line, particularly if it offers customers a better deal for their old titles.

The French images show more objects in the southern corridor, a huge stretch of ocean towards Antarctica. This covers the path the plane could have taken if it headed south but it is not known how close to the other sightings – by Australia and Chine – the latest objects are. The Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement today: "This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor. "Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

This is the third promising discovery as the international search enters its third week. Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein was yesterday given a hand written note in the middle of his daily press briefing. China spotted the 74ft by 42ft piece of debris via satellite images. It was 75 miles south west of an earlier sighting by Australia. Six aircraft had already covered 13,900 square miles of ocean south west of Perth in Australia in the hunt for the plane. Investigators are also looking into claims that the captain of the missing flight, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, received a two-minute long call from a mystery woman shortly before take-off. Suspicions have been raised because the call was made from a Pay as You Go SIM card obtained recently under a false identity.

There are fears that the discovery backs up claims Captain Zaharie, 53, had possible links to terror groups, who frequently use untraceable SIM cards to avoid detection. It has been claimed he is a supporter of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was jailed for five years in a controversial court hearing which took place just hours before the missing flight departed. The Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur at 12.40am on March 8 and went missing half an hour into the fight to Beijing. It disappeared off military radar altogether at 2.15am. Authorities also face a race against time to locate the plane's black box voice and data recorder, which transmits an electronic signal for just 30 days before running out of battery. The family of the 239 people on the aircraft are frustrated with the lack of information they are receiving.###4790||Empty###4791||Empty###4792||Text size

Shares of enterprise and consumer software vendor Symantec (SYMC) are down $2.64, or almost 13%, at $18.26, after the company yesterday afternoon abruptly announced it terminated CEO Steve Bennett, saying it needed new management to "driver on the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth.

The stock has gotten gotten five downgrades this morning, that I can see, from Jefferies & Co., R.W. Baird, UBS, MKM Partners, and Cowen & Co.

The bears, including those downgrading today, see disruption despite much progress made by Bennett to date. Some bulls, however, defended the shares, pointing out the low valuation.

Brent Thill, UBS: Cuts his rating to Neutral from Buy, and cuts his price target to $21 from $27. "Our Buy-rating was predicated on the turnaround abilities of prior CEO Steve Bennett, view there was 1,000bp of OM expansion over the next few years, and belief that it could innovate in product. We believe the Board was happy w/ Steve Bennett's operational performance but less so with the product strategy which increases the risk profile of revs and leverage going forward. Don't see much downside at 11x CY14e EPS, 3% div yield, but no catalysts and absent a permanent CEO and new CFO arriving product strategy, revs growth and margins too opaque [...] Key risk is that the new product portfolio and strategy expected to be unveiled at the Vision user conference in May is not ready or worse underwhelming which raises earnings risk. If the Board felt a new CEO was needed to address the product direction and/or quicken the pace of the existing strategy, both scenarios suggest a prolonged turn in bookings which we see as required to resume stock momentum."

Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen & Co.: Cuts his rating to Market Perform from Outperform, and cuts his price target to $20 from $25. "Mr. Bennett's hiring had precipitated a wave of investor optimism that the former Intuit CEO could transform SYMC into a co. capable of material operating improvement. His strategy was, in our view, necessarily far-reaching, and some disruption had always been inevitable. Nonetheless, the impact to bookings over the last two quarters had been more painful than most, including us, had expected. We also suspect part of the reason for the change in leadership is that Bennett is short on technical expertise (and we note the co.'s integrated product strategy has taken longer to deliver than expected), although we don't believe that tells the entire story. While SYMC hasn't changed its long-term targets, the co. indicated that it will accelerate its focus on product innovation and growth. That may cause some investors to believe the co. will taper its cost-cutting. For our part, we continue to believe 30%+ op. margins by FY17 is very achievable; however, given the changing of the guard, our prior view that SYMC could be a mid 30s op. margin company in 3-4 years no longer holds. We also continue to be very skeptical of SYMC's 5%+ growth target, regardless of how much increased emphasis SYMC may opt to place on this going forward."

Walter Pritchard, Citigroup: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $28 price target. "It is clear the move was precipitated by the board and was made because the board didn't believe the company was moving fast enough towards goals outlined. Bennett had only been CEO for six quarters and had made significant change in the process. It is not clear in our view what could have moved faster. Perhaps waiting three quarters to make significant changes to the sales organization was the issue, although its unlikely this would have been decided without input from the board. September appeared to be the bottom (~17% billings decline), with billings declining 10% in December. We forecast "less bad" March (-5%) and then flattening of billings in FY15 and a return to modest growth. Our inputs up until this point continue to lead us to believe this is likely. The company did reiterate March quarter guidance, although with timing of quarter close in 10 days, it is not clear anyone can have great confidence in this reiteration. This is all in the stock at 8x cash flow, in our view – Shares are cheap and investor sentiment is worst in our space. Its been rare that software stocks trade below 8x cash flow, suggesting the market believes numbers are still too aggressive. While fundamentals may have taken a turn for the worst, we note that our FCF (unleveled) estimate for FY14 ($1.28B) is below average of last year's ($1.48B) and looks reasonable to us."

Raimo Lenschow, Barclays: Reiterates an Overweight rating, and a $26 price target. "Though it was clear that operational improvements were necessary at the company, it was likely too much and too quick for the BoD which ultimately led to today's event. While Symantec is committing to the previously set guidance, in addition to the "5/30" long-term goal set by Steve Bennett, it is nevertheless a short-term blow to the investment case. However, we feel longer term Symantec's positioning in the industry and the current valuation (c. 10x CY15 PE), which is one of the cheapest in our sector still supports the potential for share price improvement and ongoing earnings and cash flow growth […] Given that Mr. Brown expressed his wishes not to be considered for the permanent role, the candidate will likely be external though we would expect much of the operational actions introduced by Mr. Bennett to remain intact as in our view they were generally the right steps to take but were executed upon much too aggressively, like realigning 90% of the company's sales force in a single quarter and creating a sizable billings and deferred revenue hole for a mostly recurring revenue business model […] Given recent management hires, particularly the appointment of Amit Mital as Chief Technology Officer, who joined the company after a 20-year career at Microsoft, we believe that from a product perspective the company is still generally well positioned in the industry. We would also note that interim CEO Mike Brown does have public company CEO experience, joining Symantec through the acquisition of VERITAS Software in July 2005, and had also previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation which is likely to provide some level of business continuity throughout this transition."###4793||Istanbul: Turkish President Abdullah Gul set himself publicly at odds with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, saying that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter.

Turkey’s courts blocked access to Twitter following Erdogan’s vow, on the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, to ‘wipe out’ the service. In a defiant stand, Erdogan said he did not care what the international community had to say about it.

The prime minister, who has been in power for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing.

Gul, however, took to Twitter himself to say complete bans on social media platforms were unacceptable and to voice his hope that the block would be short-lived.

Turkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.

“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted. He said that individual internet pages should only be blocked if there is a court order on the grounds that a person’s privacy is being violated.

Gul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has remained a close ally, but he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure than the combative prime minister and their relationship has at times appeared strained.

In the run up to the elections, the president has been hesitant to openly criticise Erdogan, despite the brewing scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government. Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a corruption scandal Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content.

“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

Twitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread internet disconnections on Thursday night. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said he was ‘gravely concerned’ by the move.

“Being free to communicate and freely choose the means to do it is [a] fundamental EU value,” Fuele wrote on his Twitter account.

Turkey’s financial markets were also unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares falling 0.7 per cent and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 per cent from 11.12.

San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the social media service on Thursday. “Twitter, mwitter!”, he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.

“We will wipe out all of these,” Erdogan said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the republic of Turkey is,” he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.###4794||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###4796||You are using an older browser version.

Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, hours after the country's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "eradicate" the social network in response to alleged recordings of him making corrupt statements being posted on the site.

A number of incriminating wiretaps, including one in which Erdogan supposedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence during a police graft probe, have surfaced on the internet in the past weeks.

Erdogan denies corruption and says the recording was a fabrication. The leaks come at a particular sensitive time for the government with key local elections taking place this month.

Speaking at a rally on Thursday Erdogan said: "We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic."

By the early hours of Friday morning, the country’s 10 million Twitter users began to report access the site being blocked. They are now confronted with a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing court orders as reason for the site's closure.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban on her Twitter account as "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

"Turkish people and the (international) community will see this as censorship. It is," she s

Turkey has no current plans to block access to other social media platforms such as Facebook, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on Friday.

"The path was taken to block access within the framework of a court decision because of the failure to overcome the problem with the management of Twitter," the official said.

TOKYO, March 21 (Reuters) - Mt. Gox said on Friday it found 200,000 “forgotten” bitcoins on March 7, a week after the Tokyo-based digital currency exchange filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it lost nearly all the 850,000 bitcoins it held, worth some $500 million at today’s prices.

Mt. Gox made the announcement on its website. Online sleuths had noticed around 200,000 bitcoins moving through the crypto-currency exchange after the bankruptcy filing.

The exchange, headed by 28-year-old Frenchman Mark Karpeles, said the bitcoins were found in an old-format online wallet which it had thought no longer held any bitcoins, but which it checked again after its bankruptcy filing.

“On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC,” the statement said.

It added that it moved the 200,000 bitcoins from online to offline wallets on March 14-15 “for security reasons.” “These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels,” it noted.

Many of Mt. Gox’s 127,000 creditors, who feared they had lost their investments when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, are skeptical about what the exchange has said happened to the bitcoins it had. In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox also said $28 million was “missing” from its Japanese bank accounts.

BITCOIN TRACKING

On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago overseeing a class action against Mt. Gox revised a previous order, allowing some of the exchange’s bitcoin movements to be tracked.

“Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we’ve been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it “found” these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins,” Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters in emailed comments.

Edelson is representing Illinois resident Gregory Greene, who proposed the class action over what he claims is a massive fraud. Mt. Gox blamed the loss of 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own on hackers who attacked its software.

Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins is now about $7 billion. (Additional reporting by Tom Hals in DELAWARE; Editing by Ian Geoghegan and Miral Fahmy)###4801||



All three of Ohio's largest banks passed the latest round of stress tests mandated by regulators, meaning they would be expected to survive if the economy collapsed like it did six years ago.

Only one of the 30 banks most significant to the U.S. financial system, Zions Bank of Salt Lake City, didn't pass the stress test imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Locally, KeyCorp of Cleveland, Fifth Third of Cincinnati and Huntington of Columbus all passed, as did three other banks with a significant presence in Northeast Ohio: PNC, Chase and U.S. Bank.

The tests have been assessed four times since 2009 on the 18 most significant banks. This year, however, 12 banks with more than $50 billion in assets were added. That added banks like Huntington.

The tests look at how the bank would fare if it were pounded by loan losses and were hemorrhaging capital.

Specifically, regulators looked at the health of the banks if the economy was hit by a deep recession with high unemployment, a tanking stock market and a drop in home values to 2001 levels.

In addition, the tests this year looked at what would happen if a bank's largest counterparty defaulted.

One part of the stress test looked at potential loan loss rates among the banks. Key, Fifth Third and Huntington all were below the average of 5.6 percent.



In this post-meltdown era, banks must get approval for things they spend capital on, such as dividends paid to shareholders and purchases of other banks. The Federal Reserve next week will release results on whether the banks' requests for their capital have been approved.



###4802||Istanbul: Turkey on Friday blocked access to Twitter nine days before local elections, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan acted on his vow to shut down leaks targeting his government amid a corruption probe.

The move was criticised both within Turkey and overseas, as users accessed Twitter via proxies and other work-arounds. President Abdullah Gul was one of them, posting to his Twitter account that the total ban of a social media platform "can't be condoned" and that he hoped it wouldn't last.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called Erdogan's ban a "groundless, pointless, cowardly" act of censorship. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the premier is "waging a campaign against all the media and press that he cannot directly influence or control."

The shutdown began hours after Erdogan said San Francisco-based Twitter had ignored court orders to remove content related to the graft investigation. He's also threatened to block Facebook and YouTube, where users have shared material including videos, recordings and transcripts that were first leaked via Twitter. Some of them are tied to a police investigation of government corruption which has cost four cabinet ministers their jobs and roiled markets.

It has been estimated that there are 10 million Twitter users in Turkey.###4803||Empty###4804||Text size

France has provided new satellite data showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.

The new information, given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia, shows "potential objects" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

Anyone buying a pay-as-you-go SIM card in Malaysia has to fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number.

In this case, police traced the number to a shop selling SIM cards in Kuala Lumpur.

They found that it had been bought "very recently" by someone who gave a woman's name - but was using a false identity.

There has been speculation that Zaharie, 53, was linked to anti-government protest groups in Malaysia.

Everyone else who spoke to the pilot on his phone in the hours before the flight took off has already been interviewed.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud", Royal Australian Air Force flight Lieutenant Russell Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.



Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."



Details on the French data were not immediately released. The statement from Malaysia called the information "new satellite images", while a statement from France's Foreign Ministry said "radar echoes taken by a satellite" had located floating debris but made no mention of imagery.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is leading the search in waters off Australia, declined to offer details about the information from France. The authority did not respond to multiple requests by The Associated Press for access to the data.



"Any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans," AMSA said.

But a Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data consisted of radar echoes captured on Friday and converted into fuzzy images that located objects about 930 kilometres north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured on Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22m by 13m, said the official, who declined to be identified because he isn't authorised to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.



Information about the new data emerged as authorities coordinating the search, which is being conducted about 2500km southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours. It was spotted on Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a New Zealand air force Orion dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.



"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue co-ordination centre. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

Royal New Zealand Air Force Air Commodore Mike Yardley said there had been no sightings of interest. The only thing the crew saw was seaweed. A picture of something floating in the southern Indian Ocean, as seen from the New Zealand Orion was released.

The sighting of a wooden pallet raised hopes. While they were commonly used in shipping, they could also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.



AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.



"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."



Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of Sunday night.



Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether flight MH370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared, but did not immediately respond to the email.



An official with Malaysia Airlines said on Sunday night that the flight was carrying wooden pallets but provided no further details, including the number of pallets.



When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they first found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.



The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Reuters

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it could keep interest rates unusually low even after the US job market returns to full strength and inflation rises to the central bank's target.

In announcing its view on future rates after a two-day policy meeting, it also dropped a set of guideposts it was using to help the public anticipate when it would finally start bumping overnight borrowing costs up from zero.

It said, however, that dropping a promise to hold rates steady "well past the time" the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent did not indicate any change in its policy intentions. Rather than relying on unemployment and inflation thresholds to guide expectations, it said would lean on a wide range of economic indicators in making its decision.

But what stood out in the central bank's statement was its embrace of easy money policies even after the Fed achieves its goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation.

"Economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run," the Fed's policy panel said after its first meeting chaired by Janet Yellen.

Yellen, who took the helm of the central bank on Feb. 1, is set to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).

U.S. stock prices fell after the statement was released, while yields on U.S. government debt rose.

The central bank also proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota dissented, saying that dropping the threshold could hurt the credibility of the Fed's commitment to return inflation to 2 percent.

MEASURE WIND DOWN

The decision to continue to scale back its stimulus keeps the Fed on track for the measured wind down laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke. The Fed repeated that it plans to continue trimming the asset purchases in "measured steps" as long as labor conditions continue to improve and inflation shows signs of rising back toward the Fed's 2-percent goal.

The Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.

The Fed had said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.

But the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs.

Of the Fed's 16 policymakers, only one believes it will be appropriate to raise rates this year; 13 expect a first rate hike next year, and 2 others see the first rate hike coming in 2016, according to fresh forecasts published on Wednesday. But once rate hikes start, Fed officials see slightly sharper increases than they did in December, with rates ending 2015 at 1 percent and ending 2016 at 2.25 percent, according to the median of forecasts.

In December, Fed officials expected short-term rates to be just 1.75 percent by the end of 2016.

The new forecasts also show Fed officials see unemployment dropping slightly faster, to between 5.6 percent and 5.9 percent by the end of 2015. In December their forecasts called for unemployment falling to between 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015.

KEEPING MARKETS IN LINE

The Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring.

It began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10 billion.

At the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But as the actual jobless rate neared the threshold, officials began to seek a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy.

They want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts. If traders start to price in earlier rate hikes, the result would be tighter financial conditions that could deter the very investment and hiring that the Fed wants to promote.

Many Fed officials, including Yellen, have said recent weakness in economic data, from jobs and retail sales to industrial production and home building, appears largely due to the unusually harsh winter and should soon dissipate.

US Fed revamps rates guidance, trims bond buys further

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy's strength, and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.

KEY POINTS:

* Fed dropping its promise to hold rates steady "well past the time" the U.S. unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent doesn't indicate any change in the Fed's policy intentions.

* Fed cuts monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

* Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.

COMMENTS: MARGARET KERINS, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME STRATEGY, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, CHICAGO:

"Her speech was extremely dovish, but we believed going in to the Fed meeting today the market was priced to the perfect dove. There was a slight change in the summary of economic projections, the jobs were slightly more hawkish and the rapid improvement in the labor market was reflected in those projections by the Fed themselves, even though they're adding in quite a grouping of labor market indicators that they're watching.

"They're going to have to focus on that lack of growth potential going forward, and introducing that today. But clearly the market is reading it as hawkish. We don't think that the Fed given where we are in the economic cycle and in terms of the recovery, and our expectation that the economy will take off following this somewhat weather-related downturn that it's very, very hard to be credible about keeping rates really, really low."

BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:

"I think the (stock) market initially reacted negatively to the Fed's statement because the forward guidance is mildly hawkish. Yellen is no dove. She's a pragmatist. The new forward guidance axes the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and replaces it with inflation expectations. The interesting twist here is that the Fed is fine with a zero federal funds rate provided the Fed projects inflation to still be below its target of 2 percent. It used to be that the Fed would tolerate projected inflation running a half percent hotter than that. Also, it's not just about the Fed's projections, but the public's expectations of inflation. The Fed wants to keep inflation expectations anchored and those expectations can be fickle."

SCOTT CLEMONS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN PRIVATE BANKING, NEW YORK:

"It strikes me as a pretty dovish statement, but what surprised me is the word choice. Right now the unemployment rate remains elevated. I think that the Fed is far more focused on that than they are on their other mandate, inflation."

"The bigger picture here, to me this sends a very strong signal that the Yellen Fed is a continuation of the Bernanke Fed in one very important aspect. Whereas the Fed is often thought of as having two policy tools, balance sheet operations and interest rates, under Bernanke and Yellen they have made communication a very potent third tool as well. They're going to communicate, communicate, communicate so that when the fed funds rate begins to move higher, hopefully the collective economy shrugs its shoulders and says, 'Yeah, we knew that was coming.'"

JIM KOCHAN, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:

"The committee has updated its forward guidance, I wish they would tell us what that updated forward guidance is. We can assume their forward guidance is that they will be looking at broader measures of labor market activity to see when it's appropriate to raise interest rates, and 6.5 percent doesn't have much meaning anymore. If there are going to be any surprises it's going to be with the press conference. I think it was very much as expected."

DAVID MOLAR, PARTNER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR AT HIGHTOWER, SAN DIEGO:

"The Fed moved the goal post again. It goes from a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold to a qualitative approach which is nebulous for the market. No one knows what will trigger further tapering, a pause in tapering or an increase in asset purchase. It's a major change in policy. This Fed seems to be making it up as it goes along. The markets are spiking on this even though analysts have been expecting this along. Gold has sold off and you are seeing pressure on bonds and rate-sensitive sectors."

MARK GRANT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SOUTHWEST SECURITIES, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA: "What seems to be troubling the market is that even though it reiterated that it wouldn't be raising rates this year, people were put on notice that a hike is coming. We'll likely see some rise in short rates as a result of this, if not out across the whole curve." SHAUN OSBORNE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: "It's a little bit more hawkish than people expected. They seem to see interest rates rising sooner rather than later. People had been expecting something slightly more dovish given the effects on economic activity from the harsh winter. This is helping the dollar." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO, LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "I think everybody expected a $10 billion cut in the rate of QE3 purchases to $55 billion, so there's no surprise there. "There was a high degree of speculation in terms of changing the Fed language, so there was some clarity on that point. "Probably the biggest takeaway was the Fed saying they would possibly consider maintaining monetary policy or interest rates lower than what they would normally be even when the Fed guideline targets of unemployment and inflation were hit. So the question becomes whether that would in fact create some inflation pressure." THOMAS DI GALOMA, CO-HEAD FIXED INCOME RATES, ED&F MAN CAPITAL, NEW YORK "This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets -- the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015."

WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, ROCKWELL SECURITIES, NEW YORK "So far this is just what the market wanted-the Fed staying accommodative. It doesn't look like too much has changed, although dropping the 6.5 percent unemployment rate might be a key issue. Yields are jumping up right now, which might be a sign that people think Yellen will tighten sooner rather than later, or that inflation could come into the market if the Fed keeps rates low well past 6.5 percent."

BRUCE McCAIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, KEY PRIVATE BANK, CLEVELAND, OHIO "At this point, there are relatively few surprises. I think in some sense, as the Fed tapers it becomes less important for the market. What becomes more important from here is whether the economy can recover its momentum once the weather issue thaws. One of the headlines I saw was that a majority of members do expect a rate hike. I think that's a little disappointing for investors. In addition, if we replace the 6.5 percent rate with a variety of indicators, that makes Fed actions less predictable, which adds to the market uncertainty." PAUL MANGUS, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH AND STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO PRIVATE BANK, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA "The one difference I could see early on was a little bit more information on when and by how much the Fed may increase rates in 2015, which is a long way off yet. Other than that, we expected to hear more about a wider range of economic indicators beyond the unemployment rate and that was in the release, so that was not a surprise. The economic information that was supplied was also pretty much as expected, mentions of weaker labor markets earlier in the year due to weather conditions but showing signs of improving. Other areas of the economy are continuing to show signs of gradual improvement, but the Fed was looking for a much stronger economic background before it would start any type of tightening efforts, so it would continue to support liquidity in the marketplace."

Buying used Car###4810||###4811||It was handbags at dawn yesterday and the bloodied loser was Mulberry boss Bruno Guillon, who paid with his job for meddling with middle England's favourite handbag-maker.

The Somerset firm announced Guillon's departure with "immediate effect" after the firm's attempt to chase the spending power of high end shoppers on New York's Fifth Avenue and Hong Kong's Causeway Bay alienated the John Lewis crowd back home – who were its most loyal shoppers, even if they had to save up for months to buy one of its soft leather bags.

In a terse statement to the stock exchange, the company's chairman Godfrey Davis said he was returning to lead the business and thanked the Frenchman for his hard work.

That "hard work" included engineering a slump in sales and profits that has seen the company's stock market value crash from £1.5bn to just £400m.

His two year reign also saw the departure of Emma Hill, the creative genius who was credited with bringing about the brand's renaissance in the first place, with bestselling designs such as the Alexa – a satchel named after presenter Alexa Chung – and the Del Rey, dedicated to singer Lana Del Rey.

It has been reported that Hill, who had previously worked for Burberry and Marc Jacobs, did not agree with Mulberry's push upmarket and her important position remains vacant.

Davis politely insisted that Guillon, who joined from Hermès in 2012, had improved the quality of the Mulberry offering and increased its appeal in overseas markets. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he said.

Four years ago, when Davis was still running Mulberry, he told the Guardian it was a "grave mistake for luxury brands to think all their customers are super-rich". He drilled into staff the importance of being friendly to customers and the firm's internal mantra "we don't believe in bad manners, fashion egos or size zeros" was an antidote to austere Bond Street boutiques.

Back then, Mulberry's classic Bays-water bag, costing £500, was within touching distance for many British women. Today, after Guillon introduced more exotic finishes such as ostrich skin, they start at around £900. Its smallest bag – a clutch style wallet measuring 11cm by 20cm – costs £495, while keyrings run to £100.

Having watched Burberry's success over the last decade, Guillon was eyeing the $390bn global market for designer clothes and accessories, where well-heeled shoppers do not bat an eyelid at a four- or five-figure price tag. Recent initiatives include a collaboration with model Cara Delevingne unveiled at London fashion week and included a bag inspired by her lion tattoo.

But with more than 60% of Mulberry's sales rung up in the UK, its traditional shoppers were priced out of the market and have since defected to fast-growing brands such as Michael Kors and Coach whose arm candy are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals.

When Guillon took over in 2012 Mulberry could do no wrong for shoppers or investors. It was the sleeper success of the luxury goods sector, having quietly metamorphosed from a staid brand, adopted by the green welly brigade in the 1980s, into a fun and unpredictable label capable of conjuring up "it-bags" that "it-girls" such as Chung were happy to sling over their shoulders. Like many brands it owes a debt to Kate Moss, a friend of Hill's, who lit a fuse in the fashion press when she stepped out with a Bayswater in the crook of her arm a decade ago. Moss's patronage proved a turning point for the brand, putting it on the radar of Grazia readers.

Lorna Hall, head of retail at trend consultancy WGSN, said it can be very hard for fashion brands to move upmarket and even more so in the glare of the stock market where executives are forced to publish regular sales updates. "When you make this kind of shift there is always a danger of alienating your existing customers," she said. "Mulberry has made a big shift in its prices. It had customers who were willing to pay £500 but they won't go above that. She was Mulberry shopper - not a Louis Vuitton or a Chanel shopper."

Davis has rescued the brand before. He took charge in 2002, when after years of losses, Mulberry's biggest shareholder, the Singaporean billionaire Christina Ong, ousted the founder, Roger Saul, in a bloody boardroom coup. History repeated itself on Thursday but there were no tears, from investors anyway, with the shares closing the day up more than 5%.###4812||Empty###4813||Colorado started off 2014 with a declining unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, continuing a sustained downward trend evident in 2013.

The last time the unemployment rate was as low as 6.1 percent was December 2008.

In addition employers added 7,300 nonfarm payroll jobs from December to January for a total of 2,412,200 jobs.

The number of people actively participating in the labor force increased 5,900 to 2,754,600 and total employment increased 8,000 to 2,586,100 causing the number of unemployed to decline 2,000, according to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down one and one-tenth of a percentage point from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

The Colorado unemployment rate peaked at 9.1 percent in October 2010 and has declined almost without interruption since then, said officials.

In December, Colorado posted an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent.

The December figure was the lowest unemployment rate in five years.

By comparison, the unemployment rate in September was 6.9 percent; 6.8 percent in October, 6.5 percent in November, and 6.2 in December.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Ottawa is acting against those "responsible for undermining Ukraine's sovereignty." The 14 individuals named Friday included Gennady Timchenko, a founder of Gunvor Group, one of the world's largest commodity-trading companies.

Canada's move came a day after the U.S. included Mr. Timchenko in a new round of economic sanctions against Russia for its takeover of Ukraine's Crimea.

Others on Ottawa's latest list for "economic sanctions and travel bans" include an aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin, senior government officials, and Yuri Valentinovich Kovalchuk, the single largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya. Rossiya and Kovalchuk were also put on the U.S. sanctions list Thursday.

Ottawa also imposed economic sanctions against the bank itself "for its support of Russian officials who bear responsibility for the crisis."

Mr. Harper is currently traveling to Ukraine, where he is meeting officials before heading to the Netherlands and Germany.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade in their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores.

Starting next week, customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers for in return for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games. The latter was an apparent reference to GameStop’s program.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think the move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

And Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pointed out that GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###4818||Airbnb may raise a massive $500 million round with a valuation of $10 billion, according to an anonymously sourced report from the Wall Street Journal.

In a related report by The Inquisitr, a Texas principal tried banning speaking Spanish on campus only to lose her job over the incident after an outcry from Hispanics.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the one who threatened the Turkey Twitter ban. The government censored the web domain for all internet users in the country, but that did not last very long at all. The Twitter company itself sent out messages reminding everyone how to use cell phone-based SMS text messaging to access Twitter. They also gave tips on alternative computer settings that could bypass Turkey’s blocks, which simply use redirects of the domain name so using an outside DNS server can help. Other private companies offered Twitter access in Turkey via Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and internet proxies services.

Philip Howard, head of the Digital Activism Research Project, claims that Turkey’s Twitter ban only caused the service to become more popular within the country:

“Trying to ban Twitter has backfired. It’s drawn the world’s attention to the country’s increasingly tough censorship and surveillance strategy. News of the ban seems to have driven more Turks to try Twitter out for the first time, breaking national records for Twitter use. Tip sheets for getting around the ban spread like wildfire.”

Instead of deterring people, the Turkey Twitter ban actually emboldened people and the number of Tweets out of Turkey increased to record levels. It’s claimed by some that practically the only people who are not using Twitter in Turkey now are pro-government supporters. It’s estimated by some survey that almost 15 percent of the Turkish population is now using Twitter.

But why was Turkey’s Twitter ban implemented in the first place? Some reports claim Prime Minister Erdogan targeted the social media platform because Turkish users were using it to spread news and videos showcasing the corruption of the Turkish government.

David Kramer, president of the pro-democracy group Freedom House, claims that a truly democratic nation should not be afraid of Twitter:

“The decision to block Twitter, a leading medium of communication in Turkey, is quite a dramatic step for a government that claims to be democratic. It is a bold attempt to stop news of government corruption from getting out in the run-up to local elections. The government should immediately reopen Twitter and recognize that free, unhindered space for debate is essential in Turkey, as it is anywhere else.”

Turkey’s Twitter ban is not the first time they’ve attempted internet censorship. The government tried the same thing with YouTube only to have technically savvy Turkish people bypass their efforts. Twitter is also banned in China but many Chinese still use the social media service regardless of their government’s censorship.###4820||First Alert Weather: Cold front on the way

New York is taking a closer look at high-frequency traders—and how stock exchanges are helping them, for a price.

Eric Schneiderman, the state’s attorney general, said he has opened an investigation into the sale of products and services that offer high-frequency traders faster access to data. Schneiderman has made the combating of what he calls “Insider Trading 2.0” a central focus.

Stock markets charge traders thousands of dollars to “co-locate” their servers at the exchanges’ data centers, giving them access to data milliseconds before those whose servers are elsewhere. Schneiderman is also looking at dark pools and at high-frequency traders themselves.

“This new breed of predatory behavior gives a small segment of the industry an enormous advantage over all other competitors and allows them to use new technologies to reap huge profits based on very, very minor, but nonetheless unfair, advantages,” Schneiderman said yesterday. “Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets, as structured today, are increasingly too focused on catering to them.”

The attorney general said he would push for new rules to curtail those advantages.

“My office is going to continue to shine a light on unseemly practices,” Schneiderman said. “I look forward to joining with other regulators and my colleagues in government in taking real, concrete steps to deal with this problem.”###4825||Why did this happen?

Dollar Soars as End of ZIRP in Sight

The Federal Reserve left investors with a very clear message overnight.

Janet Yellen began to set expectations for tightening. Bernanke went to lengths to make it known than tapering does not equal tightening but Yellen spoke about how and when rates will be increased.

"In fact there was an entire new paragraph dedicated to how the central bank will approach the removal of policy accommodation and what sent stocks plunging and the dollar soaring was Yellen's comment that the first rate will most likely be 6 months after Quantitative Easing ends," says Kathy Lien at BK Asset Management.

According to Lien if the Fed maintains its current pace of tapering, asset purchases will cease in the fall, which means that the first rate hike will be in the summer of 2015.

The net result has been a bullish US dollar exchange rate complex and a weaker commodity dollar complex.

We are seeing the likes of the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars all suffer as global investors shift funds back to the US in anticipation of better interest rates and thus yields on their investments.###4828||By continuing to browse our site you agree to our use of cookies, privacy policy and terms of service.

Specifically, economic strength.

The message was this: Whenever I decide to, I can pick up a pen, and kill a significant financial institution in your country.

Related: Does Putin Want to Carve Up Ukraine and Take the Spoils?

Obama’s victim was the St. Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya.

In response to Russia’s takeover of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, Obama yesterday authorized the Treasury Department to add 20 members of Putin’s inner circle, as well as Bank Rossiya, to the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s list of “specially designated nationals.”

The designation makes the individuals named ineligible to do business with U.S. financial institutions, which is likely a major personal inconvenience. But for Bank Rossiya, the designation is something like the kiss of death.



Bank Rossiya is not the largest bank in Russia by a long shot, but its significance lies in its clientele rather than its size. In announcing the sanctions, the Treasury Department noted that Bank Rossiya “is the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation” including members of the Ozero Dacha Cooperative, an exclusive community where members of Putin’s inner circle live. In addition, it provides financial services to the single largest segment of the Russian economy – the oil, gas, and energy sector.

Essentially, this is a credit union for oligarchs, with a side business in financing the Russian energy industry. Its customers include many more high-profile Russians than just those named in the Treasury statement. As of Thursday it is, for all intents and purposes, out of business.

If account holders want to do any kind of business at all short of paying their utility bills and using Russian ATMs, they are going to need to go elsewhere, said experts.

“They’ve got to go to another bank,” said Lester M. Joseph, former principal deputy chief of the Department of Justice’s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering section. “That bank is pretty much a pariah.”

Currently the international investigations manager at Wells Fargo Bank, Joseph said when heard about the sanctions on Bank Rossiya, the first thing he did was check to see if it was a customer of his institution. “It is not, thankfully,” he said.

The impact doesn’t stop there, Joseph explained. His next step, which is ongoing, is to see if any banks that Wells Fargo has relationships with are also doing business with Bank Rossiya, and to make sure that none of those banks are routing transactions from the Russian bank through Wells Fargo’s system. “If a transaction from that bank is coming from another bank, we would have to block it,” he said.

Related: IMF Now Divides Congress Over Support of Ukraine

Joseph said that every other bank in the U.S. is – or ought to be – doing exactly the same thing.

Considering the volume of international wire transfers that flow through the systems of U.S. banks, he said, this essentially shuts down Bank Rossiya’s access to a huge portion of the worldwide banking system.

As one U.S. official told Reuters, Bank Rossiya will be “frozen out of the dollar.”

And it only gets worse.

Even if governments in other countries don’t join the U.S. in sanctions against Bank Rossiya, their bankers will have a very strong incentive to stop doing business with the Russian bank if they have any ties at all to U.S. institutions – which virtually all significant international banks do.

Related: Russia’s Provocative New Act of Aggression in Ukraine

“If they are doing business with that bank, and they are also doing business in the United States, if something slips through,” then suddenly they’re facing U.S. regulatory action, said Robert Rowe, vice president and senior counsel for the American Bankers Association. International wire traffic is voluminous and largely automated, he said, making it easier for an international bank to simply stop doing business with Bank Rossiya rather than trying to route transactions associated with it away from the U.S.

Rowe said this would affect not only individuals who do their banking at Bank Rossiya, but perhaps more importantly, the oil and gas companies that arrange their trade financing through the bank.

“That’s where it’s going to have an impact,” said Rowe.

Banking experts said that one of the uncertainties surrounding yesterday’s move is how Russia will respond. The Russian government immediately released a widely mocked list of U.S. officials whom it said would be blocked from doing business in Russia.

Related: Confusion Reigns Over Path Forward in Crimea

Politicians named on the list rushed to Twitter to boast about being sanctioned and to leave sarcastic comments about being forced to forgo vacations in Siberia.

However, according to John Byrne, executive vice president of the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists – a trade group for bankers and law enforcement professionals who deal with issues including OFAC compliance – that’s likely not the end of it.

“There’s no question these sanctions are an appropriate and effective national security tool,

he said, “but this is a country that can fight back.”

How Russia reacts to the sanctions, Byrne said, will be closely watched by the financial community. And that reaction is by no means predictable. In general, major industrialized countries don’t try to shut down each other’s financial institutions without evidence of blatant illegal activity – which does not appear to exist in the case of Bank Rossiya.

“This is a new thing,” said Joseph. “It’s not a rogue bank. It’s a bank in a country where we do a lot of business. It’s not involved in a criminal case.” Compared to other actions by past administrations, he said, “It’s much more complex.”

Top Reads from The Fiscal Times###4830||Watch out, GameStop, you have a new competitor in the used game market. Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to "shake up" the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

There are 880 million video games sitting in homes today, Mac Naughton said. And according to a cited NPD report, 80 percent of these games, or more than 700 million, are rarely played. Clearly, there is a market for second-hand games, just look at GameStop's quarterly revenue for evidence of that. But why trade these games in at Wal-Mart instead of GameStop or Best Buy?

Wal-Mart's "true differentiator," Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can't compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It's credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.

Wal-Mart will accept all games (provided they are not scratched or damaged beyond repair) and refurbish them via a third-party company. These games will then be sold at stores and online with a "certified pre-owned" label on their packaging. Wal-Mart expects to have a solid inventory of secondhand games available this summer.

GameStop has its own dedicated refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas and it is this very operation that management believes sets GameStop apart from competitors. We've reached out to Gamestop for comment on this story but we have not heard back.

Just because Wal-Mart is getting into the used game market, it doesn't mean the company is backing away from new games anytime soon. The company's new release business will "remain a focus" for Wal-Mart going forward, Mac Naughton said.

But why get into the secondhand market now, in 2014, when an increasing amount of attention is paid to download services? It's a question we poised to Mac Naughton and he said Wal-Mart isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many. Still, he explained that Wal-Mart is indeed eyeing the digital market as a future growth opportunity.

"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good," he said. "We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges."

Wal-Mart's move into the used-game market will also conceivably affect publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, which do not participate in second-hand sales. We've also reached out to these companies, but have not heard back. We'll have more in the future.

Finally, though Mac Naughton never mentioned GameStop by name during the call, he said Wal-Mart's aim with its secondhand program is to "pay more than anybody else" for your old games. Of course, trade-in prices will vary, but he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.

Here's how Wal-Mart's used-game program works:###4831||Empty###4832||UK Chancellor George Osborne will officially unveil the new £1 coin in today's budget announcement.

The new 12-sided coin is based on the old threepenny bit and will replace the current coin, which has been in circulation for 30 years. The new £1 coin will be introduced in 2017.

Osborne will reveal in his Budget 2014 speech that a replacement is needed because the pound coin has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

Royal Mint now estimates that about 45 million of £1 coins in circulation are forgeries.

"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," Osborne will say.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

The Treasury will also confirm that while the Queen will remain on one side, the other side's design will be open to public competition.

"The Bank welcomes [the] news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency," said the Bank of England in a press statement.###4833||State AGs Eye Comcast-Time Warner Deal

Airbnb is said to be raising between $400 million and $500 million, led by TPG, a massive firm that has funded companies ranging from Burger King to J. Crew. If true, this round will bring Airbnb’s total funding to between $726 million and $826 million — the firm previously raised $326 million since its founding in 2008. An Airbnb spokesperson declined to comment on the news. TPG did not immediately respond to VentureBeat’s request for comment.

Fed officials including Richard Fisher, James Bullard and Narayana Kocherlakota are all due to speak later on Friday, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen surprised markets mid-week by suggesting the possibility of raising interest rates early next year.

U.S. yields have all moved higher as markets brought forward the risk of a Fed rate hike by April. The dollar index last traded at 80.192 .DXY, not far from the high of 80.354, a level not seen since late February.

“A heavy Fed speaker calendar Friday will be carefully parsed for any effort to roll back this week’s shift forward in tightening expectations,” analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients.

However, they noted that most of the Fed speakers are generally on the hawkish end of the spectrum.

“In any event, we would expect the Fed to struggle to fully reverse the move in rates...unless data begins to significantly disappoint expectations once again.”

U.S. data on Thursday was mixed but a rebound in factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region held out hope the economy might be regaining strength after being hobbled by severe weather.

Against the yen, the euro eased to 141.07 yen, back near the lower-end of this week’s 140.46-141.97 range.

The U.S. dollar struggled to make further gains on the Japanese currency after topping out at 102.69 on Wednesday. It last stood at 102.39.

The greenback also lost steam against the Canadian and Australian dollars. It last traded at C$1.1237 after reaching a 4-1/2 year high of C$1.1279, while the Aussie popped back above 90 U.S. cents from a low of $0.8995.

Trading in Asia is expected to be subdued with Japanese financial markets shut for a holiday.

There is little in the way of key economic data out of Asia on Friday although investors will be keeping a close eye on the yuan, which skidded to its lowest in more than a year at 6.2334 per dollar.

Rick Scott cheered the news that Floridas unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent for January, his Libertarian rival isnt buying it.

Adrian Wyllie went on the attack on Monday, insisting the lower unemployment rate means nothing.

The number of working Floridians has decreased dramatically on his (Gov. Scotts) watch, and his lackluster policies have directly resulted in thousands of lost jobs in Florida, Wyllie insisted on Monday. Floridas labor participation rate has fallen from the 25-year average of 62.4 percent, down to 59.6 percent, according to the Florida Legislature Office of Economic and Demographic Research.

In U.S. trading on Tuesday, was trading at 1.6584, down 0.32%, up from a session low of 1.6546 and off a high of 1.6647.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6383, the low from Feb. 10, and resistance at 1.6666, Monday's high.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine," signaling that Russia's moves in the area would be limited.

The speech came one day after President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters opting to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy, which came at the pound's expense.

Trading was somewhat edgy, as CNN reported that Ukraine Defense Ministry Spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Elsewhere, mixed U.S. housing and consumer inflation data watered down the dollar's gains against the pound albeit slightly.

The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.

The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase..

U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Sterling was down against the euro, with up 0.33% at 0.8396, and down against the yen, with down 0.58% at 168.31.

On Wednesday, markets will pay close attention to the Federal Reserve.

The U.S. central bank is to announce its decision on interest rates and monetary policy followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen, her first as head of the monetary authority.###4841||The state's unemployment rates continues to drop - while job creation in the Tampa Bay area is lagging behind the rest of the state.

That's according to the numbers released today by state economists. The state's unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work. Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

“With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we’re making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," the governor said in a prepared statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let’s keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one.”

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

Florida has added close to 200,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest amount in the nation according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But it was not such good news for the Tampa Bay area. The region lost 14,100 jobs and its unemployment rate rocketed back up to 6.5 percent from an adjusted 6 percent in December.###4842||This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Visa and MasterCard have blocked credit card services to some Russian bank customers as a result of US sanctions.

Four banks are so far affected, all of which have links to Russians blacklisted by the US.

Visa and MasterCard, both US-based companies, are forbidden from having any dealings with those targeted by the sanctions.

The banks, which said card services stopped without warning, have described the move as unlawful.

'Frozen out'

One of the banks affected, Bank Rossiya, is described by the US as Russia's 15th largest, with assets of $12bn (£7.27bn).

The St Petersburg-based bank has been singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials. US officials said it would be "frozen out" from the dollar.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bank Rossiya had nothing to do with events in Crimea and promised to transfer his wages there.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to protect Bank Rossiya

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

President Putin also instructed the Russian central bank to step in, if needed, but the latter said the sanctions on Bank Rossiya did "not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability".

'Illegitimate'

Visa and Mastercard also confirmed they had stopped providing services to SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday. Vladimir Putin, Russian President

The bank, which is Russia's 39th biggest with $5bn in assets, called the actions "illegitimate" because its owners, rather than the bank itself, were the subject of sanctions.

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

But Visa said more than 99% of its business in Russia was untouched by sanctions.

Russian shares fell sharply on Friday as investors weighed the impact of western sanctions over Ukraine.

The MICEX index, which is priced in roubles, fell as much as 3% and the RTS, which is priced in dollars fell 3.6%.

Stocks slumped after US President Barack Obama said sanctions might be extended to key parts of the Russian economy if Russia took further action in Ukraine.

Share falls

Russia's mining, defence and natural resources sectors could all be targets.

Stocks recovered some ground during the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to restore calm following the introduction of asset freezes and visa bans by the US against high ranking Russian officials.

The MICEX closed down 1% and the RTS index was down 1.3% at the end of the day.

Although only banks with connections to high-ranking Russian officials have been targeted, Russian bank shares were broadly lower.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed 1.17% lower - having fallen 2.9% earlier on Friday, while shares in VTB Bank were 2.61% lower after falling 4.3% earlier in the day.

Other sectors were also hit. Gas giant Gazprom was down 0.9%, oil firm Lukoil ended the day 1.36% higher. Russian steel company NLMK closed 1.94% lower.

Shares in gas producer Novatek closed down 9.63%. The company is part owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder in Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy Russian businessmen targeted by Western sanctions.

Negative outlook

Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch warned they were changing their outlook for the Russian economy to "negative" from "stable" - the first stage before a possible downgrade in the country's credit rating - because of the potential impact of sanctions.

Fitch said: "Since US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Gennady Timchenko, owner of gas firm Novatek and shareholder in Bank Rossiya, has been targeted by sanctions

President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised the move, suggesting it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

Russia's credit rating is currently BBB.

Meanwhile the rouble was stable on Friday having previously fallen sharply on Thursday evening in response to the announcement of further US sanctions.

Later on Friday morning Germany said it had decided to suspend approval of all defence-related exports to Russia.

Berlin ordered defence contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear to Russia earlier this week.

The ministry spokesman said this was a "one-off" case, but future deals would also be blocked.

"The (Rheinmetall) case that you are talking about is a one-off case. Nevertheless it is true that given the current situation in Russia, we are not approving any exports of defence goods to this country at the moment," the spokesman said.###4844||In the stress tests, the Federal Reserve examined how the biggest U.S. banks would fare in various economic scenarios, an exercise required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.

Last month, Mt. Gox, announced that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins in a theft. The total value of the lost bitcoins, which also included the company's own 100,000 bitcoins, was estimated to be $473 million. The company revealed the theft and soon after filed for bankruptcy.

Now, as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings, the company claims to have found 200,000 bitcoins in "old format" electronic wallets. These recovered bitcoins are worth $120 million at the current exchange rate. According to the announcement posted by the Japanese exchange on its website, it now holds a total of 202,000 bitcoins out of which 2000 bitcoins were with the company prior to the civil rehabilitation filing.

The investigations for the remaining 650,000 bitcoins are being carried out and the company will be updating users with new developments. Mt. Gox reopened its website recently so that users who have their money stored with the exchange's wallet service could check their balance. It may also be looking to rebrand itself and recover from the theft once the investigations conclude, but for now it is still far from recovering the lost money.

NEW YORK — The ‘‘Every Day Low Price’’ king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Walmart told the Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called ‘‘Savings Catcher’’ on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego, and Atlanta.

The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals, but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Walmart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart Store Inc.’s US discount division, said in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for ‘‘technological answers to saving them money and time.’’

Walmart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it is hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Walmart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread, and laundry detergent. But Walmart’s ‘‘every day low price’’ model is under attack by online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items for less. On top of that, the retailer’s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Walmart’s US discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health. The discounter has also seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Walmart has had a pricematching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Walmart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. By last summer, Walmart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets.###4855||Almost immediately after Walmart announced that it is entering the used-game industry, GameStop's stock shared plunged by five percent last Tuesday, March 18, USA Today reported.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

The music streaming service will soon cost $4.99 a month, The Washington Post blog reported via the official Pandora announcement. People who are already subscribing to the premium streaming service will keep the $3.99 rate for now.

Pandora has 3.3 million paid subscribers and 250 million total registered users, according to the company.

The service will also no longer be available at the annual rate of $36, changing to a monthly option only.

Pandora cited costs of royalties as an impetus behind the change. Royalty rates that go to artists through SoundExchange have risen 53 percent in the past five years and are expected to increase 9 percent more next year, according to the Pandora blog.

The streaming service will continue to offer free, customizable listening stations with ads.

Even if users decide to go back to the free streaming option, Pandora will still make money, a report from CNNMoney noted.

Subscription fees brought in $52 million in 2013, only accounting for 12 percent of Pandora's total revenue last year, according to CNNMoney's analysis of the 2013 report.

The company actually makes more profit from users who listen to ads, compared with paid subscribers, Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Company, told CNNMoney.

"That subscription price needs to go up because the value of an hour of advertising is rising," she said. "Raising the price closes the gap of what that person is worth in an ad-driven world."

Pandora's competition, which includes Spotify, iHeart Radio and Rhapsody, continues to grow as streaming services like Apple's iTunes Radio and Beats Music come into the mix.

Despite the rise of similar services, Pandora is still the leader among its competitors and posted a $9 million profit last quarter, its largest since going public in 2011, according to The Washington Post blog.###4859||Empty###4860||Top Consumer Shares:

was last down 0.18% to 101.57, having reached intra-day highs of 101.77 as President Putin spoke. The pair fell to lows of 101.32 earlier in the session.

The pair was likely to find support at 101.19, last Friday’s low and a five-week low and resistance at 101.93, the session high.

Market sentiment recovered after President Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The speech came one day after the Russian president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

But the dollar remained under pressure after data showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But, U.S. housing starts fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Elsewhere, the euro remained slightly lower against the dollar, with slipping 0.13% to 1.3903.

The euro slid earlier after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

The report indicated that the economic upswing in Germany is not at risk. The assessment of current economic conditions improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February.###4864||###4865||Empty###4866||Wal-Mart store signage is seen from the store lot on April 23, 2012 in Mexico City, Mexico.(Photo by Daniel Aguilar/Getty Images) (Photo by Daniel Aguilar/Getty Images)

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

All three major U.S. stock indices were down on the committee's afternoon statement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI)falling 44 points as of 3 p.m. EDT.

The Federal Reserve in recent months has moved away from its stance connecting the unemployment rate to its readiness to lift interest rates, and that trend continued today. While the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, it's mostly because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search. The Fed recognizes that issue and today announced that it would drop the unemployment rate as the primary measuring stick for the economy's strength. It will instead rely on a multitude of factors to decide when raising interest rates is the correct move. With that in mind, here are some large industrial companies making headlines today.

Inside the Dow, Boeing (NYSE:BA) had a couple of favorable headlines hit the news feed today. Boeing and Comair announced an order for eight 737 MAX 8s, the first such order from an African operator. The order was actually booked in December 2013 but was previously unidentified on the Boeing orders and deliveries website; it is valued at $830 million at list prices. This order will support future fleet expansion for the brands operated by Comair. There's also an option for the carrier to take another eight aircraft in the future.

In other positive news for the aviation juggernaut, the Federal Aviation Administration announced today that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is safe after a thorough review of its lithium-ion battery issues.

"We concluded that the aircraft was soundly designed, and that Boeing and the FAA had processes in place that were designed to identify and correct any issue that might arise during the manufacturing process," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said, according to USA Today. "It's many layered. You don't have single points of failure."

This is welcome news for Boeing investors who have grown weary of the Dreamliner project running over budget due to production delays and other issues. As production of the 787 Dreamliner continues to accelerate, investors hope the project will become profitable for Boeing in 2016.

Outside the Dow, investors of General Motors are hoping that its recent recalls of millions of vehicles globally doesn't turn into a nightmare akin to Toyota's (NYSE:TM) unintended acceleration problems. Toyota just agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine, which is the largest penalty imposed on any automaker, according to federal prosecutors. Ultimately, the defect led to a recall of more than 10 million vehicles and the company's admission to concealing information and making false statements regarding safety issues.

"Other car companies should not repeat Toyota's mistake," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned in a statement, according to Automotive News. "A recall may damage a company's reputation, but deceiving your customers makes that damage far more lasting."

Toyota will record the $1.2 billion in after-tax charges against earnings. While this is a huge penalty it won't put a dent in the automaker's cash pile of nearly $60 billion. That said, this drawn-out process could have larger ramifications for its brand inside the automotive industry, where Toyota long ago captured the image of reliability and safety. While General Motors is beginning its own battle with ignition issues linked to at least 12 deaths, Toyota's tarnished image could open up the door for Ford to continue increasing its market share and positive brand image in the U.S. market.###4869||Why did this happen?

From the Associated Press:

The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.

The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker’s disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.

“Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues … Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress,” Holder told a news conference.

Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, “we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust,” said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. “In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first.”

Toyota said it had “made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totaling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.

###4871||In the absence of hard facts, speculation about what really happened on Flight 370 has been rampant. But do any of these explanations hold up? We take a look at the competing theories

It’s 12 days since the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A 250-ton Boeing 777-200 has, for the time being, vanished. Twenty-six countries have joined a search of 2.24m square nautical miles from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite images have given investigators cause to believe there may be debris in the southern Indian Ocean, but so far, a search of the area has found nothing.

In the absence of confirmed sightings, speculation has been rife about what happened to the plane and the 239 people on board, with competing theories feverishly discussed by professionals and amateurs. Some sound more plausible than others. Here, we assess the relative merits of the more prominent explanations for the plane’s disappearance.

1. What happened?

It was an accident …

Those remaining hopeful that no one deliberately wronged MH370 and its passengers were boosted by a much-shared online post by Christopher Goodfellow, a former pilot. Something malfunctioned, Goodfellow surmised, and a sharp turn to the left made in the flight’s first hour was, in fact, a swift attempted re-route by the pilot to the nearest runway on which he could land: a 13,000-foot strip on Pulau Langkawi, the largest island in an archipelago of 104 in the Andaman Sea.

The left turn is the key here. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a very experienced senior captain with 18,000 hours of flight time. We old pilots were drilled to know what is the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Airports behind us, airports abeam us, and airports ahead of us. They’re always in our head. Always. If something happens, you don’t want to be thinking about what are you going to do – you already know what you are going to do. When I saw that left turn with a direct heading, I instinctively knew he was heading for an airport. He was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi, a 13,000-foot airstrip with an approach over water and no obstacles.

Goodfellow theorised that “there was most likely a fire or electrical fire” He suggested that the plane’s transponder and ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) were shut off as casualties of a scramble to tackle this blaze. “In the case of fire the first response is to pull all the main [electrical] busses and restore circuits one by one until you have isolated the bad one,” he said, adding that the crew could have been incapacitated by smoke before they could land, leaving the plane to fly on for six or more hours on autopilot, before eventually crashing.

Goodfellow’s theory was comfortingly simple, but suffered from a major shortcoming. Malaysian authorities have said the plane appeared to have been re-routed a second time after that first sharp turn. A third tracking device, on the plane’s engines, continued sending intermittent electronic “pings” via satellite to the ground for another six hours, indicating that the plane continued to fly.

The final “ping” put its last known position on one of two arcs. Investigators said that the electronic “pings” put its last known position on one of two arcs of a circle emanating out from the satellite that detected it. One arc is to the north, over China, and the other is to the south over the Indian ocean, off the western coast of Australia. Goodfellow’s assumed autopilot could not have taken the plane to either destination.

“If the pings are accurate, the plane turned again,” said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and an author on aviation. “Autopilot only does what it tells you to.” He went on: “It is also very unlikely that the plane could have carried on flying for hours after it had indeed suffered a fire or other mechanical catastrophe”. Smith concluded: “It is not a strong theory.”

It was no accident …

After it was discovered that the two separate communications systems were turned off, investigators said that they had concluded that MH370 was the victim of a hijacking or sabotage. “These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,” Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said. Little other solid evidence has been produced or cited by the Malaysians for why this conclusion was reached. Still, two theories followed.

a) The pilot or co-pilot were responsible

Attention has focused on captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. A transponder and ACARS can only be shut down by someone who knows what he or she is doing. “The flight crew, by virtue of the controls and the circuit-breaker panels in the cockpit, have the ability to remove power from them,” said Dennis Schmitz, a veteran engineer and executive in the aviation communications industry. Malaysian ministers also initially said, at a 15 March news conference, that one of the communicating systems was switched off before the last known verbal message from the cockpit – “all right, good night”.

But authorities later backtracked on this, admitting they did not know exactly when the systems were shut down. The pilots did not show signs of radical activity, although Shah’s support for a Malaysian opposition leader jailed the day before the flight has been much analysed. The pair also did not request to fly together, and appear to have been upstanding professionals, according to several profiles. Adding to the confusion, US officials briefed reporters in recent days that the plane was first manually rerouted before that final verbal sign-off – again indicating foul play in the cockpit from someone with technical knowhow. “That is a red flag,” said Smith.



Shah kept a flight simulator at home. Malaysian officials said on Wednesday that some files had been removed from it several weeks ago. “The experts are looking at what are the logs, what has been cleared,” Malaysian police inspector general Tan Sri Khalid Bin Abu Bakar told reporters, at a news conference. Hishammuddin Hussein, the defence and acting transport minister, appeared to confirm reports that the FBI had been asked to help analyse the files, which he said were being looked at with “local and international expertise”.

b) The plane was hijacked by someone else

If the plane was deliberately sabotaged, and the pilots were not responsible, someone else on the plane must have been. Malaysian military radar “appeared to show that the missing airliner climbed to 45,000 feet” before descending steeply, the New York Times reported, which could potentially indicate a struggle in the cockpit. However, this report also prompted speculation that a knowledgeable flyer had deliberately flown that high in an attempt to deprive some on board of oxygen, thus knocking them out or even killing them.

There remains a lack of consensus among experts about the precise technicalities of ACARS. A full disabling of the system requires circuits to be broken not only in the cockpit “but also in the electronics bay”, according to Smith. This bay is found beneath the flight deck, indicating that someone involved was at one point outside the cockpit.

The passengers included two men flying on stolen passports and at least one from China’s restive Xinjiang region, whose separatist militants were blamed for a knife attack at a railway station that killed 29 people earlier this month.

Yet the men travelling on stolen passports appear to have been seeking asylum in Europe and had no clear connection to terrorism or militant groups. Background checks on passengers and crew have turned up no likely suspects, and China has announced that it has unearthed nothing untoward in the profiles of the two-thirds of passengers who were Chinese. Commandeering the plane, disabling its communications systems and flying it smoothly would require organisation and expertise that would seem difficult to hide.

However, no message claiming responsibility for taking the plane appears to have been left by any passenger, and no group has claimed responsibility for it. And – to state the obvious – nothing appears to have been done with it.

2. Where is the plane?

The northern of the two arcs identified by investigators as the possible locations from where the plane sent its final “ping” sweeps from southern to north-western China, prompting speculation that MH370 might have flown over south Asia towards smaller central territories, where it could have landed. Some have even suggested it could have been parked, awaiting use in a future terrorist attack. But “there are hundreds of planes in airports and depots all over the world,” Smith pointed out. “Why take this one and force the whole world to look for you?”

Kazakhstan and Krgyzstan were quickly singled out as potential landing spots. Yet both governments stressed that they would have detected the plane, and did not. “Even if all on-board equipment is switched off, it is impossible to fly through in a silent mode,” Serik Mukhtybayev, deputy head of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Committee, said in a statement. “There are also military bodies monitoring the country’s air space.” Dair Tokobayev, vice-president of Kyrgyzstan’s main civilian airport, told Reuters: “This plane did not fly over Kyrgyzstan’s territory.”

And for the plane to have reached that arc several hours after losing contact with the ground, it would have probably have needed to avoid detection by several major militaries in the region. While most countries protect the locations of their radar sites, researchers estimate that China alone has about 30 long-range systems.

“They must have long-range radar out there,” said Ron Ruggeri, a veteran air-traffic controller and instructor at Vaughn College of aeronautics and technology. “If the plane did go that way, somebody would have seen it.” He went on: “Things are also a little on-edge in that part of the world. If they did not know who this plane was, I’d expect them to scramble jets to find out”.

b) The plane flew somewhere else

Dismissing the significance of the two possible arcs, some have speculated that sightings show the MH370 went on to fly elsewhere. Residents of some remote islands in the Maldives said they had spotted a “low-flying jumbo jet” on the morning the MH370 disappeared, according to Haveeru, a local news site. Their description seemed to match that of the missing jet.

However the Maldives government swiftly dismissed the suggestion. “Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country,” said the Maldives National Defence Force in a statement, adding that airport radar had come up short, too.

Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox, suggested on Twitter that the plane might have been “effectively hidden, perhaps in northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden”. The Pakistani government has firmly rejected the notion and said the plane was not detected by its radars. Indian officials have also pushed back against speculation the plane flew over the country.

c) The plane flew to the south and probably crashed into the sea

Proponents of the second arc, which curves away gradually from the western coast of Australia, have MH370 heading south from its sharp left turn, over the Indian ocean. The lack of confirmed sightings by radar systems to the north, and the fact that no wreckage of the plane has been recovered in Asia, has boosted speculation that this is the more likely of the two directions. On Thursday, the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, told parliament in Canberra that satellite imagery had found two possible pieces of debris at a location 2,500km (1,500 miles) south-west of Perth. Detailed analysis of that imagery produced “new and credible information”, he said, although an initial aerial search turned up nothing.

Map shows where the Australian Maritime Safety Authority plans to search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on 18 March 2014.

After hitting the southern arc and flying on for a little longer, the plane could have descended into the two-mile-deep ocean and sunk, along with its two “black box” data recorders that will have collected information and audio from the cockpit. More than a third of the recorders’ 30-day batteries, which allow it to send a beacon-like signal to investigators, have now expired.



Experts stress that the south is likely to prove more fruitful. “I look for who would have the best intelligence,” said Dr Todd Curtis, a former airline safety analyst for Boeing. “The US has a view of what’s going on all over the world, and when the White House announced last week that it was despatching the seventh fleet to the Indian Ocean, it signalled to me that this was the most likely location. And since then, the Australians have taken the lead down there.”

Australia said on Thursday that it had halved the search area in the Indian Ocean – albeit to an area still covering 300,000 square kilometres – and moved it closer to Perth.

Reuters quoted a source close to the investigation on Wednesday as saying: “The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor.” Within hours, however, this had been challenged by the Malaysian defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein. “They are both equally important,” he said of the two arcs. “But the southern corridor is much more challenging.”###4872||Nobody, except perhaps Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, seems very happy about Turkey's ban on Twitter. It has caused an uproar among Turkish citizens, who are finding ways get around the ban, Turkey's own president, and now the White House.

The Obama administration condemned the ban in an emailed statement on Friday, stating that blocking Twitter undermines a citizen's "ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association," and "runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world."

Erdoğan said Thursday he wanted to "eradicate" Twitter, but the block seems to have backfired: Turks have sent 1.2 million tweets within the country since the block, using various circumvention tools — including IP addresses being spread via graffiti.

The White House statement, issued by Press Secretary Jay Carney, reveals that the U.S. government has "conveyed" serious concern over the situation.

"We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information," Carney wrote.

Erdoğan said on Thursday that he doesn't care what the international community says. The United States and Turkey have remained friendly in recent years, based on a personal rapport between President Obama and Erdoğan. But that relationship has strained in recent months, according to analysts, after disagreements on Egypt — Turkey backed ousted President Mohamed Morsi — and Syria, when the U.S. decided not to launch a military operation.

The full White House statement is below:

The United States is deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools. We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world. We have conveyed our serious concern to the Turkish government, urge Turkish authorities to respect the freedom of the press by permitting the independent and unfettered operation of media of all kinds, and support the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies.

UPDATE, 4.30 p.m. ET: The U.S. State Department echoed the White House in condemning the ban, with its own statement.

The United States supports freedom of expression in Turkey and opposes any action to encroach on the right to free speech. We urge the Turkish Government to unblock its citizens’ access to Twitter and ensure free access to all social media platforms. An independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies. Today's shutdown of Twitter is contrary to Turkey's own expressed desire to uphold the highest standards of democracy. We have conveyed our serious concern over this action to Turkish authorities.###4873||Oracle reports its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and analysts have hopes for a good quarter.

They are expecting 4% growth in revenue over the year-ago quarter, and EPS to be $0.70, up from $0.65.

If the company exceeds these targets, it will be a two-in-a-row beat.

Oracle could really use that. It missed revenue expectations for the prior three quarters in a row, an almost unheard of series of misses for the company as it struggled to stop its hardware business from shrinking.

With revenue soft, Oracle spent most of 2013 in cost-cutting mode. That meant that many Oracle employees didn't get their bonuses, Wall analyst analyst Steve Koenig, of Wedbush said in a research note published last week:

"Our checks suggest FY13 bonuses were trimmed or eliminated for many employees across the company , which augurs wells for cost control, but not so much for ORCL's ability to attract and retain talent."

Koenig clarified to Business Insider, "It's anecdotal, but we heard from more employees that they are not getting their fiscal '13 bonuses, which ended [last] May. And it seems that that sort of thing is more frequent than it has been in the past. [This affects] people in marketing, internal development, etc."

The company has been beefing up its revenue numbers with cloud acquisitions. However Koenig says that once those acquisitions get absorbed, Oracle hasn't been making much hay with them.

"Some of the SaaS acquisitions they've done don't look they are generating a whole lot of growth. I've heard that RightNow is doing really well, but I conclude that Taleo is probably not growing well," he says. Oracle bought customer service cloud RightNow for $1.5 billion in 2011 and bought human resource cloud Taleo for $1.9 billion in 2012.

He says that if you strip out the revenue from whatever cloud acquisition Oracle has most recently completed, "cloud revenue out stays flat."

Still, Koenig isn't panning the stock altogether. He maintains a "neutral" rating and target price of $40. The stock is trading at about $38 now.

He thinks Oracle is going to beat consensus expectations tomorrow, and that it's doing an especially good job in selling its the latest version of its bread-and-butter product, the database. Oracle released a new version of its database, 12c, last summer. 12c is designed for cloud computing applications, an area where enterprises are investing heavily.

Oracle declined comment.###4874||In the stress tests, the Federal Reserve examined how the biggest U.S. banks would fare in various economic scenarios, an exercise required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Below are the Fed’s estimates for the minimum capital ratios the banks would see in the “severely adverse” economic scenario.###4875||JavaScript is disabled in your browser.

Results of the Fed's annual "stress tests" showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks' financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year's tests.

"The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago," said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The banks' stronger positions should enable them to pursue business plans, pay dividends to shareholders, raise capital from investors and expand services to customers, said Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed's stress tests' "severely adverse" scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That's down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year's tests — even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks' progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.

The 30 banks were also tested on how well they would withstand severe downturns in Europe and in Asian countries like China and Japan.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Nearly all U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in assets were in the group of 30 that were tested. Together they account for some $13.5 trillion in assets — about 80 percent of U.S. banks' total amount. Twelve of the 30 banks were added to the testing roster for the first time this year.

Most of the 30 banks tested, along with hundreds of others, received federal bailouts during the financial crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.

Zions, the only bank to fall short this year, is based in Salt Lake City. It slid to a loss in the fourth quarter as it booked hefty charges related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items.

Zions said in a statement that its performance on the stress tests was worse than it expected mostly due to significantly higher commercial real estate losses, significantly greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue. The bank said that it will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Ally said it was pleased that the test results "recognized the substantial transformation that the company has undergone since last year."

The Fed concluded last March that Wall Street powerhouses JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needed better plans for coping with a severe downturn and gave the banks until September to revise them. The two banks were allowed to increase their dividends and buy back their stock on condition they submitted revised capital plans that satisfied the Fed.

At the same time, the Fed approved requests outright from 14 of the 18 banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

But the Fed forbade Ally and BB&T Corp. from making any dividend increases and share buybacks they may have been seeking.

Next Wednesday, the Fed will announce whether it has approved each bank's request, if one has been made, to raise dividends for shareholders. Its decisions will be based on how each bank would fare in a severe recession if it increased its payout.

Raising dividends costs money. The government doesn't want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.

The other banks tested were: American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Comerica Inc., Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp, M&T Bank Corp., Northern Trust Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., Santander Holdings USA Inc., State Street Corp., U.S. Bancorp and UnionBanCal Corp.

SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) – Drought-plagued California will ease some protection for fish in the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, officials said Tuesday, a move expected to make more water available for farming and ease political tensions in an election year.

SPONSORED

The move marks a retreat from restrictions imposed earlier in the year which had widely been expected to be tightened further, rather than eased, and was welcomed in the agricultural community.

“California’s agriculture is critical to the world’s food supply,” said assemblywoman Kristin Olsen, who represents part of the San Joaquin Valley, who had lobbied hard against the restrictions. “An inability to produce that food would clearly be devastating to health and human safety not only in California but around the globe.”

Citing recent rains, regulators said Tuesday there was enough water in the state’s reservoirs now to partially ease restrictions.

“We were quite concerned at that time about the issue of public health and safety,” Tom Howard, executive director of the state Water Resources Control Board, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “This really had the markings of a historic drought.”

The move comes after weeks of intensive lobbying from growers, lawmakers from agricultural regions and the state’s two U.S. Senators, who said the restrictions, along with the possible curtailment of water rights for some agricultural and municipal customers, would harm the state’s economy.

The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of a drought that may still turn out to be one of the worst in its history despite storms that brought rain and snow last week, leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water and possibly forcing farmers to leave fallow a half-million acres of land.

Recent storms dropped nearly a foot of rain in some areas, boosting reservoir levels and the snowpack that the state relies on for drinking water in the spring, but still leaving supplies way below normal for this time of year.

Earlier this month, concern that the state was about to restrict water supplies to farmers even further swept through the agricultural community, spurring intensive pushback and a series of tense meetings with water regulators in the administration of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

“We are very concerned that if the current proposal as reported to us is enacted, it will have significant near- and long-term effects on the California economy and, more importantly, will not achieve the desired water supply security intended,” U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jim Costa and John Garamendi, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to the water board.

CUTBACKS STILL POSSIBLE

Under the new rules announced Tuesday, which Howard said may be modified again next month, the two massive public water projects responsible for pumping in the delta will be able to deliver it to farmers and others, once the state determines that there is enough flowing to meet the health and sanitation needs of residents.

Scott Shapiro, an attorney specializing in water issues for the Sacramento firm Downey Brand, said expanding the allowable uses of tight water supplies was not just important for farmers.

“It’s not just for agriculture, because there are other needs that may be contracted for that go beyond health and safety,” Shapiro said. “It could include other municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.

In addition to allowing more of the water pumped from the delta to be used for purposes other than meeting health and safety needs, the state planned to reduce by about a third the amount of water that the projects were required to leave in the delta as a way of protecting fish, Howard said during the press briefing.

But he cautioned that the state could still implement severe cutbacks to the water rights of many users if dry conditions continue.

Environmental groups, long critical of what they say is over-use of the state’s limited water resources for farming in dry areas, did not immediately respond to the rules change.

Mark Cowin, director water resources for the state, said that fish and wildlife experts consulted by his department said that endangered species in the delta would not be harmed by the looser rules.

Malaysia said Saturday that a Chinese satellite had spotted a large object along a broad stretch of ocean where officials hope to find a Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing for more than two weeks.

Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted an object 74 feet by 43 feet.

‘‘The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify,’’ he said.

State broadcaster CCTV tweeted an image of the object and said it was captured around noon Tuesday, about 75 miles south of another satellite image that was taken days earlier of two objects in the water.

Planes and ships have been searching the area of the earlier discovery for three days but have found nothing so far. Flight 370 went missing March 8 shortly after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

After about a week of confusion, authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777 for several hours after it disappeared from air traffic control screens indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia up to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Three Australian planes took off at dawn Saturday for a third day of scouring a desolate stretch of the southern Indian Ocean for possible parts of the missing plane.

Officials are still cautioning the search will be a protracted operation, with Minister Hussein saying searchers were facing a "long haul."

Efforts by more than two dozen countries have thus far failed to uncover conclusive evidence as to what happened to the jet, with the apparent slow progress leading to frustration and fresh questions. Searches on Friday proved fruitless, despite improved weather conditions from a day earlier.

Also on Friday, a purported transcript of the final conversations between the pilots of the plane and air traffic controllers was published by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. They appear to show the last 54 minutes of air-to-ground recordings for Flight 370.

The log ends with the words "All right, good night," believed to have been spoken by the missing plane's co-pilot before the cockpit's contact to air traffic control was severed.

A satellite spotted two large objects in the area earlier this week, raising hopes of finding the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Six aircraft and two merchant ships were scouring the area on Saturday, although Australian officials have cautioned the objects, one up to 72 feet in length, may not be related to the missing aircraft or might have sunk.

A small flotilla of ships from China is expected to arrive in the next few days.

Officials with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority were also checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information. The images that led to the focus on the southern Indian Ocean were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them.

Meanwhile, Malaysia has asked the U.S. for undersea surveillance equipment to help in the search, according to the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to assess the availability of the technology and its usefulness in the search, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said.

The Pentagon says it has spent $2.5 million to operate ships and aircraft in the search and has budgeted another $1.5 million for the efforts.###4887||Last Updated: 17 Apr 2014

Mulberry was the it-brand a few years ago, its handbags adorning the arms of every celeb worth their salt, from the Duchess of Cambridge to Alexa Chung (who had a satchel named after her). However, after just two years in charge of the luxury fashion house and three profit warnings in the space of 18 months, boss Bruno Guillon has left.



‘I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years. He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales,’ said Godfrey Davis, who has been promoted from non-exec chairman to exec chairman until the company finds a successor to Guillon.



A tad disingenuous perhaps, given the brand’s struggle to sell its pricey bags in Asia last year. Mulberry’s troubles have also coincied with the exit of creative director Emma Hill, credited with giving the company that je ne sais quoi. Hill quit in June last year amid rumours she’d fallen out with Guillon over pushing up prices.



Investors took the news of Guillon’s departure rather well – shares were up almost 2% in mid-morning trading. After the Frenchman presided over a 66% slump in the share price, shareholders will be hoping Mulberry can find the next big thing.

The last time the unemployment rate was as low as 6.1 percent was December 2008.

In addition employers added 7,300 nonfarm payroll jobs from December to January for a total of 2,412,200 jobs.

The number of people actively participating in the labor force increased 5,900 to 2,754,600 and total employment increased 8,000 to 2,586,100 causing the number of unemployed to decline 2,000, according to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down one and one-tenth of a percentage point from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

The Colorado unemployment rate peaked at 9.1 percent in October 2010 and has declined almost without interruption since then, said officials.

In December, Colorado posted an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent.

The December figure was the lowest unemployment rate in five years.

By comparison, the unemployment rate in September was 6.9 percent; 6.8 percent in October, 6.5 percent in November, and 6.2 in December.

The rate was 4.3 percent in January compared to 4.2 percent in December.

The rate was 5.0 percent last January. The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent -- the lowest national rate since October 2008.

"Despite a slight increase in the January unemployment rate, Iowa's unemployment conditions have improved substantially from one year ago," said Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development in a news release issued Monday. "The state's annual average unemployment rate for 2013 dropped to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2012. Iowa had the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation in 2013."

INDEPTH LOOK AT STATS:

Iowa nonfarm employment decreased by 7,300 jobs in January, lowering the total to 1,536,900. The monthly drop was dominated by larger-than-expected service sector layoffs in trade and transportation, as seasonal workers were laid off. In the goods-producing sector, construction also contributed to the loss.



Government was down 800 jobs in local and federal government, outweighing the gains in state government. Nonfarm employment has steadily trended upward despite the recent weakness, and is currently 19,500 jobs higher than one year ago (+1.3 percent).

Professional and business services added the most jobs in January (+1,600), partly due to early seasonal hiring in accounting and tax specialty firms. This monthly gain more than offset the slight loss in temporary help services. Financial activities added 900 jobs to offset smaller losses over the last few months. This sector has been resilient in Iowa, and is 900 jobs higher than a year ago and also at an all-time high.



Alternatively, retail trade accounted for over half of the jobs lost this month (-4,500), which was largely due to retail stores reducing their staff to pre-holiday levels. Transportation and warehousing industries also dropped employment (900), reflecting the seasonal layoffs of package delivery couriers. The construction sector pared jobs for the second month in a row (-2,600). However, the outlook for this sector is bright with the demand for new residential housing and commercial buildings on the rise.

Compared to last January, nonfarm employment has added 19,500 jobs. As a result of the annual benchmark revision, manufacturing is once again leading all sectors in year-over-year gains (+4,100). Education and health services followed closely behind (+4,000), and professional and business services ranked in third place (+3,900). Information services has been on a downward trend for the past decade, and trails last year’s level by 800 jobs. Construction is down a slight 400 jobs from one year ago.

Symantec's (SYMC) board announced that company director Michael Brown will replace Bennett on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is hired.

The maker of Norton antivirus software and corporate cybersecurity systems has been struggling with disappointing financial results, and it is in the process of reorganizing its business. Symantec said in January 2013 that it planned to refresh its product offerings with a focus on integrating its services across devices.

The company employs more than 20,000 people, and says 99% of Fortune 500 firms are Symantec customers.

Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said the company was working to find a CEO who could "drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

Schulman praised Bennett's progress in reorganizing the company and reducing costs, adding that his firing was "not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Bennett had been at the helm of Symantec since July 2012. He was previously a member of the company's board, and served as president and CEO at financial software company Intuit (INTU) from 2000 to 2007.###4895||You are using an older browser version.

###4902||Shares of Symantec ( SYMC ) dropped 6% in after-hours trade on Thursday after the software security maker announced the removal of Steve Bennett as the president and chief executive officer.

Bennett took over Symantec's reigns in mid-2012 and initiated several organizational changes to counter the company's lower sales and profitability.

However, while the realignment of the organization's structure by eliminating several mid-level management positions bolstered the bottom line, sales force reorganizations have not yet yielded the desired results. On the other hand, Symantec's sales were impacted by the disruptions in customer relationships.

Moreover, the weak PC market is affecting the sales of Symantec's security solutions. As per the latest report from IDC, PC shipments will drop 6.1% in 2014, the third consecutive year of decline. This will affect the sale of Symantec's PC security solutions and business volume to a considerable extent.

To counter this decline, the company is concentrating more on the mobile business, which will enable it to generate additional volumes.

Nonetheless, Symantec reiterated fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 guidance reflecting that the CEO's exit would not have a material impact on the company's operations.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion reported in the year-ago period.

Non-GAAP operating margins are also unchanged at 24.5% to 26.0% compared to 24.1% last year. Management also expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 40 cents and 42 cents compared with 44 cents in the year-ago period.

Symantec is making efforts to attract small and mid-sized businesses with the introduction of enhanced versions of storage management and Internet security solutions. These solutions are primarily targeted at information-driven businesses.

However, the company faces increased competition from other bellwethers such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Intel ( INTC ).

Currently, Symantec has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock at this time would be Juniper Networks ( JNPR ), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).###4903||Investing.com -

Investing.com - German economic sentiment deteriorated sharply in March, dampening optimism over the health of the euro zone's largest economy, industry data showed on Tuesday.

In a report, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment tumbled by 9.1 points to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to fall by 2.7 points to 53.0 in March.

The Current Conditions Index improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February, missing expectations for an increase to 52.0.

Meanwhile, the index of euro zone economic sentiment dropped to 61.5 in March from 68.5 in February, worse than expectations for a decline to 67.3.

On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.

Following the release of that data, the euro added to losses against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD shedding 0.22% to trade at 1.3892, compared to 1.3913 ahead of the data.

Meanwhile, European stock markets remained lower. The EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.5%, France's CAC 40 declined 0.2%, Germany's DAX shed 0.6%, while London's FTSE 100 inched down 0.3%.###4904||Empty###4905||Empty###4906||

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.

The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker's disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.

"Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues ... Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress," Holder told a news conference.

Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, "we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust," said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. "In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first."

Toyota said it had "made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totalling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totalling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.###4907||Why did this happen?

The letter, dated Thursday, was signed by Reps. Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a "breakthrough" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that "a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it."

Due to Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado's and Pennsylvania's Medicaid programs had already announced that they're funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California's is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is "encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi."

Meanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.

Health insurer WellPoint (WLP) chimed in Friday with concerns about new hepatitis C drug costs, said executive Ken Goulet.

Biotech Stocks Cheaper

Gilead's (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), whose sole drug, Soliris, goes for upward of $400,000 a year, tumbled 8%. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which also sells an expensive hepatitis C drug called Incivek, retreated 5%.

Biogen Idec (BIIB), which has a costly multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, lost 8%.

IBD's top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 4.5%.

AbbVie (ABBV), which will likely come out with a rival and possibly cheaper rival to Sovaldi later this year, initially rallied Friday, but closed down a fraction.

"It's like Gilead caught a cold and the rest of the market caught pneumonia," said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Opportunity Fund .

Sovaldi A Bargain?

Analysts, for the most part, advised staying calm. Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that "pricing discussions could generate headline 'concern,' but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they're curing patients and improving society. ... HCV is an important public health issue (like HIV was) and validates the significance of this market."

Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a client note that she'd spoken to Gilead officials and they were already making their case that Sovaldi is actually a bargain.

"A liver transplant related to HCV costs up to $250,000 and another $50,000 each year for meds so that the person does not reject the liver," she wrote. "Gilead has co-pay programs in place (in which) the out-of-pocket cost is as low as $5."

ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex's Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year. Sovaldi's cure rate is also much higher than Incivek's, so the cost "per cure" is even better, he said in a webinar Friday.

Dems Seek 'Public Shaming'

Schoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a "public shaming" not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.

"This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi," Haines wrote.

Such a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a large nonprofit with a history of criticizing Gilead over its HIV drug pricing, recently turned its fire on Sovaldi.

"Gilead's latest display of out-of-touch greed comes on the heels of the company's January pricing its new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), at $1,000 per pill ... 1,100% more than Gilead's most expensive AIDS drug, Stribild," the AHF said in a Feb. 4 press release.

All this has played out as biotech stocks have hit a lull the last few weeks, after a bull run not seen since the 1990s, leading some to fear that the party may be over. Vandeventer says that while biotechs are a "high beta group," this is probably just a correction. After all, he points out, drug prices have been a political football since the early 1990s.

According to New York Times, a Chinese satellite has spotted an object in the southern Indian Ocean that could be from the missing airliner. The object is close to the remote area of the ocean where a multinational search party has been looking for the Malaysia Airlines plane since the past two days.

Satellite images beamed by the China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), have spotted a large object that measures 74 feet by 24 feet (22.5 meters by 13 meters) in the ocean. The location of this object is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south west of the objects that were reported to have been sighted by a commercial satellite two days ago. According to Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein of Malaysia, Chinese ships would be sent to the location to verify if they were indeed from the Malaysia Airlines plane. SASTIND had spotted similar objects a few days ago which were later dismissed to be not from the plane.

It was on Thursday that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, revealed that an Australian commercial satellite had spotted large objects floating in a remote area in the Indian Ocean that could be from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. Since then, ships and planes combing the area were not able to find anything after two days of search. This new revelation by the Chinese authorities could be a breakthrough in what has been a depressing two weeks of search for the families and authorities. Meanwhile China has sent two military planes to Perth, where it would join other aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, USA and Japan for the massive search for the Malaysia Airlines plane.

Meanwhile, in a related Inquisitr report, we had mentioned that primary investigations by authorities which led to the unearthing of transcripts between the pilots of Malaysia Airlines and Air traffic controllers on the ground did not find anything amiss in the behavior of the pilots.

The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has become one of the most compelling mysteries in the history of aviation. The aircraft took off as a routine flight from Kula Lumpur on March 8 and was headed towards Beijing. On board the plane were 227 passengers and 12 crew members. After about two hours of normal flying, it disappeared from the radar screens that were tracking it – never to reappear again. Meanwhile the plane continued to ping an ACARS Inmarsat satellite for over 8 hours after its disappearance. The Rolls Royce manufactured engines from the Boeing 777 were designed to send reports to the UK monitoring center on a periodic basis using the satellite.

Do you think there is any chance that the Malaysia Airlines plane could have landed in some remote area of the planet where authorities haven’t looked at yet?

NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop’s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###4921||Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC) owes Los Angeles $9.7 million in unpaid franchise fees, the city alleged in a lawsuit filed at U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on Friday.

The cable operator, which generates about $500 million in annual revenue from its Los Angeles system, owes $7.2 million in fees for 2010 and 2011, and $2.5 million in fees from 2008 and 2009, according to the complaint.

TWC said in a prepared statement that it believes the lawsuit is without merit. "As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen," TWC said in the statement.

As The Los Angeles Times noted, the lawsuit was filed a few weeks after TWC announced that it would hike subscription fees on its cable systems in Southern California by about 6 percent on average.

Starting March 26, gamers will be able to trade in used games at Walmart which will in turn begin being sold to the public later this year.

The process is simple: bring in your used game, with its original packaging, to the electronics department of any of the 3,100 Walmart stores across the United States. An associate will scan your game and give it a once-over to determine its value before providing you with a credit voucher that can be used in any Walmart or Sam's Club both in store and online. Your trade-in will then be refurbished and sold as a used title beginning "later this year."

Unlike GameStop, however, Walmart will not offer the option of receiving cash for game trade-ins, nor will it accept video game hardware.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a press release. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart has tested the used game market in the past; it previously had a small, kiosk-based game trading system located in some of it stores.

The website, which matches up travellers and people with rooms to rent, is reportedly close to securing a private fundraising at a valuation for the whole business of $10bn.



That would make it more valuable than either Hyatt ($8.4bn) or IHG ($8bn), despite the fact that both these firms have substantial international networks of physical assets (hotels to you and me), while Airbnb doesn’t own so much as a single bed.



It also makes Airbnb the joint most-valuable VC backed start up on the planet, alongside Dropbox and Chinese smartphone biz Xiaomi, despite the fact that the firm has never disclosed either its revenue or profits. Co-founders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gabbia - who started the firm only six years ago in San Francisco - will become the sharing economy’s first paper bilionaires.



The funding round is expected to net between $400m and $500m, and is being led by TPG (the private equity group behind car-sharing outfit Uber’s fundraising last year). Airbnb, which claims to have hosted over 11m guests since it began, is expected to use the money to expand into peer-to-peer cleaning and transport services.



Given that the firm’s last fundraising two-and-half years ago valued it at a mere $2.5bn, this new round is being seen as a major endorsement for the sharing business model. (Read MT's recent feature on the business of sharing).



But novel and thrifty as it is, this modus operandi is not without perils, as a steady stream of punter horror stories attest. Take this one from the Sydney Morning Herald about an airbnb rental in New York used to host a ‘sex freak party’, resulting in eviction and a bill for $87,000 for the apartment’s hapless tenant.



Such glitches aside, the valuation - coming as it does only a month after Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp - will certainly add to fears that a big bubble is inflating in the tech sector. If and when it bursts, it won’t just be the shareconomy that feels the pain…

Wal-Mart's got game.

The world's largest retailer on Tuesday announced plans to seriously expand its video game trade-in program to its stores. Customer who bring in used video games can receive store credit -- but not cash -- at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores beginning March 26.

Until now, Wal-Mart offered trade-ins on a much more limited basis online.

For Wal-Mart, like most major retailers, it's about about driving more customers into the store and boosting revenue. Retailers like Wal-Mart and McDonald's that more widely appeal to lower-income customers have faced a tough time battling back from the economic downturn. These customers face bleaker employment prospects and many don't have extra money to spend.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.

Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Wal-Mart.com. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," added Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching on their tablets and smartphones for the lowest prices while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals -- but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store's U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for "technological answers to saving them money and time."

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's "every day low price" model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs onto the Savings Catcher page on www.walmart.com/ and types in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data show that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.

"They're doing the work for me," said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. "The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away."###4928||Empty###4929||Empty###4930||Sign up for one of our email newsletters.

WASHINGTON — More than 20,000 taxpayers have been targeted by fake Internal Revenue Service agents in the largest phone scam of its kind the agency knows of, the IRS inspector general said on Thursday.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes and demand payment with a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration.

Legitimate IRS agents usually initiate contact by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early, the office said. But the scam has become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” he said in a statement. “The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming.”

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected.

The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the office said.

The scam has been effective in part because scammers mask caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of targets' Social Security numbers and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are not connected to a bank account.

Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores and use them just like a bank card until the money runs out or they add more.###4931||BRUSSELS: EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord Thursday on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy.

Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People's Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP's Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the eurozone's 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long.###4932||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- A new round of funding could value Airbnb at over $10 billion, signifying the company's role as a disruptive force in the hotel industry.

Private-equity firm TPG Capital is expected to lead the funding over the next few weeks -- negotiations are still in progress -- possibly bringing in up to $400 million for the property rental upstart.

The idea for Airbnb was conceived in 2008 by three Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard graduates who relocated to San Francisco, originally calling the site Airbedandbreakfast.com.

Since its inception, Airbnb has become a leader in the share economy. The site is a destination for millions of tourists looking for cheap rooms, while giving homeowners a new source of income.

Airbnb's reach spans 160 countries with more than 600,000 listings, and the site has accommodated 11 million guests in its five-year history, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company said it had a record 250,000 guests in one night on New Year's Eve 2013.

The hotel industry has begun to take notice of the company's tremendous growth.

Airbnb has cut into the industry's market share by offering cheap prices and unconventional accommodations. For example, a person can stay in a large treehouse in Hawaii for under $100 a night, much less than comparable hotel prices in the area.

The novelty of the living arrangement, along with the cheap rates, has many tourists checking with Airbnb before looking into more traditional accommodations. Airbnb takes 3% from a host's booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.

The hotel industry has complained, saying that the site is not subject to the same regulation and tax structure that traditional hotels are, making the competition unfair.

Homeowners in New York and San Francisco have questioned the legality of Airbnb's practices regarding subletting property, and tenants say the site has diminished the supply of rental properties, driving up long-term rents.

Amid the criticism, current valuations of Airbnb make it worth more than Hyatt Hotels (H), valued at $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), valued at $9.39 billion, signaling investors see the site as the possible future of travel stay.

TPG Capital's new round of funding indicates that a public offering may be in the company's future. That would give the site fresh capital to expand advertising and hire new employees.

As a public company, Airbnb could become a marquee name in the world of short-term travel accommodations.

Starting next week, you can take your old video games to Wal-Mart and get store credit for them. According to Carl Howe, Vice President of Research at the Yankee Group, it's a smart move for the superstore.

"I think what the retailers have found is that there’s a very robust secondary market for games. They’re expensive enough and the demographic that buys games is young enough that they’re pretty cost sensitive."

The used game market in the US is worth more than $1.5 billion, which is not great news for game publishers. Companies like GameStop and Best Buy, however, have deep roots in the used game market.

Wal-Mart does have size on its side. Its hired an outside company to handle refurbishment of the old games that come in, and plans to start selling them at Wal-marts by the end of the year.

Bond prices crept steadily higher as the day progressed before moving roughly sideways going into the close. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.5 basis points to 2.75 percent.

The modest move to the upside by treasuries partly reflected easing concerns about the outlook for interest rates.

While worries that the Federal Reserve could raise rates sooner than anticipated contributed to a sharp drop by treasuries on Wednesday, traders seemed to realize that the guidance was not all the surprising.

In her post-meeting press conference, new Fed Chair Janet Yellen seemed to suggest that the central bank could begin raising rates by mid-2015.

The comments initially triggered fears across the , although analysts later noted that many economists have been offering the same forecast.

Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota released a statement this morning explaining his dissenting vote at the Fed meeting.

Kocherlakota said he wanted the Fed's statement to include language indicating that the central bank would keep rates at near-zero levels at least until the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent.

Traders also continued to digest the recent batch of U.S. economic data, which has generated optimism that the is poised to break out of the winter doldrums.

On Thursday, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected increase by its index of leading economic indicators, while a separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a significant turnaround in regional manufacturing activity.

Next week's trading could be impacted by more key economic data, including reports on new home sales, durable goods orders, and personal income and spending.

Bond traders are also likely to keep an eye on the results of the Treasury Department's auctions of two-year, five-year, and seven-year notes.

Market Analysis###4942||ISTANBUL, Turkey (Reuters) - Twitter must get a legal representative in Turkey and agree to block individual accounts if it is to resolve a row that has led the government to block access to the service, Industry Minister Fikri Isik said on Friday.

Courts blocked Twitter overnight after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s defiant vow to “wipe out” the social media service, which has been awash with allegations in a corruption scandal shaking his government ahead of elections.###4943||Warning Of IRS Nationwide Phone Scam Video

- If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS, be suspicious.



Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they are calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever. Officials say more than $1 million has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people. The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who do not pay up.###4944||As the Turkish government’s effort to ban use of Twitter continued Friday, the country’s Internet users rushed to install apps such as Hotspot Shield, which had 270,000 downloads from Turkish users within 12 hours, according to David Gorodyansky, the company’s chief executive. On a typical day, there would be 10,000 downloads in Turkey.

(NYSE:WMT) announced on Tuesday a new program that will allow gamers to trade in used video games for store credit. The world’s largest retailer said the game trade-in program will begin at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores on March 26. Customers will be able to buy the refurbished games in those stores and online later this year.

Currently, Wal-Mart offers trade-ins online, but only in a limited capacity.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

The program will allow customers to exchange used games for store credit -- but not cash. Wal-Mart said the trade-in games will be sent out to be refurbished and “made available for purchase in like-new condition.”

Games eligible for trade-in must be in their original packaging, and they will be evaluated for damages by electronics department staff. Customers will receive a specific trade-in value for each game, which they can use immediately at any Walmart or Sam’s Club store, or online at Walmart.com and SamsClub.com. USA Today reported that values will vary by game “from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.”

Customers will be able to purchase pre-owned, used video games in stores and online later this year. Games will be marked “Certified Pre-Owned,” or “fully refurbished and in like-new condition.”

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” Mac Naughton said.###4948||The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it will continue to gradually withdraw economic stimulus, but decided to move its goalposts for raising interest rates.

At the conclusion of Janet Yellen's first meeting as chair, the central bank announced a decision to reduce monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, down to $55 billion a month starting in April.

But the economy is still being supported through near-zero interest rates, which have been in place since 2008. As for when those rates would rise, policymakers decided to abandon their previous threshold of 6.5% unemployment, in favor of a broader view of the job market.

"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent," the statement said.

Forward guidance: The Fed modified its so-called forward guidance for a potential interest rate hike, because its previous guidance of 6.5% unemployment wasn't leaving much wiggle room.

The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in February. And according to its latest economic forecasts released Wednesday, the Fed now believes the unemployment rate could fall as low as 6.1% this year.

The Fed has now decided to move toward a more qualitative approach in determining interest rate policy.

"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments," Fed officials wrote in the statement.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Yellen said the job market has improved more than many had anticipated, though she stressed that it's still weak and offered a list of various labor market measures that the Fed would be looking at.

Yellen said repeatedly that the change in guidance does not signal any immediate shift in the Fed's current policy intentions. She said rates would likely remain low for a "considerable period" after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.

Investors were spooked after Yellen responded to a question by suggesting that a "considerable period" could be defined as around six months. That led investors to believe that rates could rise sooner than previously thought. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 100 points in afternoon trading.

Tapering: The Fed has been buying bonds -- mainly long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities -- since September 2012 in an attempt to stimulate the economy. But it began reducing the program this year in a process nicknamed "tapering."

The Fed has said it would continue its plan to taper by $10 billion a month unless its outlook for the economy changed substantially.

While the job market had been in a rut over the winter, economists have speculated that the slump was a temporary result of extreme weather, and indicators would recover in spring.

In its statement, the Fed said economic activity slowed during the winter months, "in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."

Yellen said bad weather contributed to a spate of weak economic data over the first few months of the year. But she said most Fed officials expect the drag from cold weather will "begin to wash out in second quarter."

Only one Fed member formally dissented against the statement. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota felt that the change in forward guidance could weaken the Fed's credibility and cause uncertainty.###4949||The euro held strong over the weekend even as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated.

The common currency traded at $1.39 at 5:45 GMT on Monday morning after economic data from the bloc supported the European Central Bank's view that the region was headed towards sustainable recovery.

The euro was resilient despite news that Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that asked the world not to recognize the Crimean vote on whether to join Russia and succeed from Ukraine. The veto highlighted the growing tension between Western leaders and Moscow as the crisis in Ukraine raged on.

On Sunday, more than 95 percent of Crimean citizens voted to join Russia in a vote that many Western leaders consider to be a violation of Ukraine's treaty as well as international law. In response, the US and Europe have said they will respond to the vote by enacting economic sanctions on Russia as early as Monday. Meanwhile, in other parts of Ukraine, pro-Russian rallies have flared up creating worries that Moscow could intervene further.

However, the euro remained supported despite the turmoil after data last week showed that the region's unemployment rate finally decreased. According to the Wall Street Journal , the EU's statistics agency reported that the number of people with jobs from October to December rose 0.1 percent to 145 million. That figure marks the first rise in eurozone employment since 2011 and added to the common currency's growing strength.

ECB President Mario Draghi expressed his concern about the rising euro last week, saying that the currency's strength could intervene in the bloc's efforts to increase inflation. Consumer prices in the region rose by just 0.8 percent in February, far below the bank's two percent target and dangerously close to deflation. Many are expecting the bank to step in and fight the region's falling inflation using monetary policy at its April meeting.

President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty taking Crimea into Russia's fold following a weekend referendum which Western leaders slammed as illegal.

The move comes less than three weeks after Russian troops seized control of the strategic peninsula in response to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Moscow government.

Kiev's new leaders warned the showdown had entered a "military stage" after soldiers were killed on both sides following a shootout in Crimea.

Despite the continuing crisis in Europe, traders are focused on the Fed's two-day meeting which ends later on Wednesday.

On Wall Street on Tuesday the Dow rose 0.55 per cent, the S&P 500 shot up 0.72 per cent - to end just short of a record high - and the Nasdaq climbed 1.25 per cent.

"Putin indicated he isn't seeking 'a partition of Ukraine', soothing market fears (for now) that the crisis will escalate further," National Australian Bank said.

"It gave investors the chance to start focusing on the (Fed) meeting tonight."

While analysts expect a further cut in the bank's stimulus program as the economy picks up, they also predict it will scrap its unemployment rate threshold.

The Fed previously said unemployment must fall to 6.5 per cent before it considers raising interest rates.

X###4955||Empty###4956||Empty###4957||The latest clue in the two-week search for a missing Malaysia Airlines jet comes from a French satellite, which has picked up images of what may be debris from the Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean.

In a statement Sunday, Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said the country had received images from French authorities “showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor.” Search efforts have been focused on this area, southwest of Perth, Australia, after both Chinese and Australian satellites picked up evidence of objects floating in the area in the past week, the Associated Press reports.

No evidence of the missing flight MH370 has been found, although searchers discovered a wooden pallet of the sort used when loading some airplanes. The airliner has been missing since March 8 after vanishing while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people, most of them Chinese nationals, on board.

Authorities say the search could be hampered Sunday by a tropical cyclone in the vicinity.

[AP]###4958||Shares of business software giant Oracle fell by more than four percent in after-hours trading after the company reported third-quarter earnings that were worse than what analysts had expected.

Oracle reported per-share earnings of 68 cents on revenue of $9.3 billion. That compares with the 70 cents on $9.4 billion that analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had predicted.

Oracle shares rose 62 cents, or 1.65 percent, during the regular session, and closed at $38.22 a share. The shares have risen by about 28 percent since hitting a recent low in June.

New software licenses rose by four percent. Hardware sales rose by eight percent. Software license updates and product support revenues rose five percent to $4.6 billion.

Oracle said it expects to report earnings of 92 to 99 cents a share in Q4, which is more or less in line with the consensus view of 96 cents. It says it expects overall sales to grow between three and seven percent, but that’s assuming the currency environment stays where it is today, which it won’t.

Speaking of currencies, Oracle took a hit on revenue growth thanks — or no thanks — to the stronger US dollar. After backing out the effect of currencies, Oracle said its sales would have grown by 10 percent, not four percent and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis would have grown by seven percent instead of five percent.

In a statement, Oracle President Mark Hurd said bookings for cloud applications rose by 60 percent and are now on a run-rate to $300 million per quarter. On a conference call with analysts, Hurd called it the “best quarter ever,” for Oracle’s cloud business.

On the call CEO Larry Ellison talked about an up-and-coming cloud infrastructure business that will compete with Amazon Web Services and IBM Softlayer. Ellison said the service will be priced competitively with AWS. He went on to say Oracle sees it as a commodity business and that’s in his words, “not a bad thing.”

While Amazon is still the king in terms of raw computing capacity and while IBM has argued — not persuasively — that it’s the biggest cloud company by revenue Oracle will try to flood the zone and take some business away from both of them.###4959||Wal-Mart Stores Inc would let US shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could hurt profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares retreated as much a 6 per cent in morning trading, making it one of top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said yesterday its trade-in service would accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp's PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360, and customers could in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam's Club.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US, said in a statement.

The move would see Wal-Mart take on retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, and GameStop, which also offered trade-in programmes for used videogames. Games of the type are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would not likely lose market share, it would be forced to enter into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

"We know that WMT (Walmart) "invests in price" ... and we expect GME (Gamestop) will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share," Schick wrote in a note to clients.

Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo famously have suffered both these maladies. Symantec, the world's largest security software provider, has now stumbled into those footsteps.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based data security and storage provider revealed March 20 that it has terminated the contract of chief executive Steve Bennett (pictured) after 20 months. Bennett, who came to Symantec as a board member in 2010 after CEO-ing Intuit to a $3 billion sales year, also resigned from the company's board of directors.

Board member Michael Brown will serve as interim CEO while the company, best known for its Norton antivirus and BackupExec software, begins its search for a permanent day-to-day leader.

Stock Price Took Big Hit

Investors were not pleased by the development. The stock closed at $20.91 March 21 but plummeted 13 percent to $18.20 in after-hours trading.

A number of industry analysts declared that they were surprised by the announcement. Symantec itself, however, contended that Bennett's exit was something the company had discussed for some months and did not happen as a result of anything inappropriate on his part.

The reason Bennett was shooed out of his corner office so early in his tenure goes way beyond his personal on-the-job performance. Bennett has long proven himself to be a competent corporate CEO; he just wasn't the right one for this job. In fact, few people on Earth are right for this job. The company is the one with serious and deep-seated problems.

In its simplest terms, Symantec is a well-established enterprise that didn't heed key trends and let new-gen IT slip by when it needed to retool several years ago. Its core business is protecting data and apps on desktop and laptop PCs; it didn't move quickly enough to invest in other lines of business when PC sales started slipping five years ago.

Symantec also didn't move to the cloud quickly enough; some of its older competitors moved faster to build products that use it. Symantec only recently cloud-ized its product line, and it's having issues getting customers to buy into the new products.

Asleep at the Wheel?

More than one person had been asleep at the wheel long before Bennett arrived.

There are multiple sides to this story, of course. Like many old-school IT vendors, Symantec has built-in problems marshaling a large global installed base in the small and midsize enterprise market. It's extremely difficult to get all those customers to pay for regular upgrades to their software when they often think it's not required. Microsoft has, um, a modicum of experience in this department.

The other major problem is the type of IT in which Symantec plays. No sector evolves faster or more thoroughly than security, which is always chasing the bad guys and never—and we do mean NEVER—getting ahead of them so as to cut them off at the pass.

As a result, a great many new, less-expensive and more agile competitors from places like Eastern Europe and Israel have sprung up, and Symantec has been taking hits as a result.

Insider Perspective

One of those competitors is Justin Moore, CEO of Axcient. The company has a well-known billboard up on the Bayshore Freeway—Interstate 101, which traverses the center of Silicon Valley and connects San Francisco on the north with San Jose on the south—that says: "R.I.P. Symantec BackupExec.cloud; Axcient Beyond Backup."

While it's clear where Moore's loyalties lie, he also provides some cogent storage-business insider perspective.

"When Steve Bennett turned around Intuit in his tenure from 2000 to 2007, the company's problem was mainly a core business and processes challenge. However, Symantec is different; the company has a technology problem," Moore told eWEEK.

"Bennett was given a year and half to turn around a company that has much deeper challenges that relate to how it has been viewing technology, which is the core of its business. When Bennett announced his vision for Symantec 4.0, which was announced less than a year ago, he made the right choices—for the most part. Yet, Symantec was already too far behind the cloud/SaaS (software-as-a-service) curve to catch up. A change of this magnitude is impossible in less than 3 to 5 years," Moore said.

Corporate Errors Add Up

Symantec is pinning the failure on Bennett—when, in reality, the core of its failing stems from decisions made years ago, Moore said.

"Symantec lacks product focus and has spread itself too thin over a variety of product lines that spans security, productivity, protection, information management, business continuity and storage in the consumer and enterprise market. Like so many other enterprise software companies, it has struggled to transition to the enterprise cloud world proving that it is indeed a systemic issue that goes far beyond Bennett's control. Given his spectacular overhaul of Intuit's business, Bennett was the right person to tackle Symantec and had shown bold ideas to fix the company, but was ultimately thrown out by Symantec's stubbornness and shortsighted approach to its technological challenges," Moore said.

Symantec has struggled in recent years against new-gen security companies such as Axcient, Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, crafted in an effort to become a serious data storage player, was widely critiqued as a mistake. Symantec's sales have been treading water for several years.

Leadership Turnover Since 2005

Symantec's leadership turnover issues started back in 2005, when the company merged with storage provider Veritas to combine it with the Norton data protection product line. Co-CEOs John Thompson (then incumbent at Symantec) and Gary Bloom (from Veritas) didn't exactly see eye-to-eye on how to run the company, and Bloom soon left for other ventures. He now heads up database maker MarkLogic.

Thompson, who was on the short list to be Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration in 2008, left in 2009 to do start up Virtual Instruments and is now chairman of the board of Microsoft. He was replaced by longtime Symantec executive Enrique Salem.

However, the well-rounded Salem also was deposed as CEO a mere three years later (2012) in favor of Bennett. Now Bennett's out the door after less than two years.

In its requisite thank you statement using Chairman Daniel Schulman's name, the board said: "We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

So the House of Norton and BackupExec is facing a real crossroads. A lot will be riding on the new face it selects to represent Symantec in the world market.###4961||Good news for Indiana's unemployment rate.

Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology start-up firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing start-ups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday. But Airbnb, a centrepiece of what has become known as “the sharing economy," is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords in big cities, as well. Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added.

The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are continuing and may still fall apart, these people cautioned. Advertisement

Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $US170 billion — paid more than $US16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $US8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged," said Colin C. Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out." Others view the valuation race more sceptically.

“We’re seeing valuations go nuts," said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr. Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.

Under the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations.###4965||Empty###4966||Empty###4967||Investing.com - The dollar traded mixed against most major currencies on Monday as investors applauded waning fears that the Ukraine standoff will escalate, hit-or-miss U.S. production data softened the greenback.

In U.S. trading on Monday, was up 0.07% at 1.3923.

Investors spent the session digesting events in Europe, after over 90% of Crimean voters on Sunday chose to break with Ukraine and join Russia. Crimea's Parliament on Monday formally asked to join the Russian Federation.

Sanctions followed as expected.

European Union foreign ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people they have linked to the push to have Crimea secede from Ukraine and be annexed by Russia. U.S. President Barack Obama also imposed sanctions on several Russian officials involved in the incursion of Crimea, which included freezing assets in the U.S.

Still, markets were expecting more widespread action from the West, and the response enticed investors away from safe-haven gold positions, which softened the precious metal.

Gold has served as a safe-haven of choice during the Ukraine crisis, and the dollar found room to rise somewhat as gold fell, as the two assets tend to trade inversely with one another.

Hit-or-miss U.S. economic indicators watered down gains.

Data revealed earlier that U.S. industrial production rose 0.6% in February, exceeding expectations for a 0.1% gain. Industrial production in January was revised to a 0.2% fall from a previously estimated 0.3% decline.

In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State manufacturing index ticked up to 5.6 this month from 4.5 in February, missing expectations for a rise to 6.0.

The conflicting data sent many to the sidelines awaiting the Federal Reserve's March decision on monetary policy due out on Wednesday, the first under new Chair Janet Yellen.

Meanwhile in Europe, official data revealed earlier that the euro zone's consumer price index rose 0.3% last month, below expectations for a 0.4% increase, after a 1.1% decline in January.

Year-on-year, consumer price inflation rose 0.7% in February, compared to expectations for a 0.8% increase, after a 0.8% gain in January.

However, core consumer price inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco, rose 0.5% in February, after a 1.7% fall the previous month and in line with market expectations.

The euro zone's core consumer price index rose 1.0% in February, also in line with expectations.

Monetary authorities pay close attention to core consumer prices when deciding policy.

The dollar was up against the yen, with up 0.39% at 101.75, and up against the Swiss franc, with up 0.10% at 0.8730.

The greenback was up against the pound, with down 0.08% at 1.6632.

The dollar was down against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with down 0.45% at 1.1055, up 0.60% at 0.9086 and up 0.40% at 0.8568.

The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.03% at 79.50.

On Tuesday, the U.S. is to produce data on consumer inflation, in addition to reports on building permits and housing starts.###4968||NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade in their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores.

Starting next week, customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers for in return for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games. The latter was an apparent reference to GameStop’s program.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think the move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

And Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pointed out that GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###4969||Empty###4970||Citi Bike honchos need tens of millions of dollars to save the struggling bicycle-share program — but Mayor de Blasio said Friday that it won’t come from the wallets of New York City taxpayers.

“At this point, city budget money is not on the table,” he said. “We will collaborate with them to help them find ways to be more efficient and more effective.”

The program was launched last year with a promise from Mayor Michael Bloomberg that it would not require public funding.

But lawsuits, glitches and a lack of use have made Citi Bike’s first year a rough ride — and the program needs a small fortune to stay in business, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Alta Bicycle Share, Citi Bike’s parent company, could generate revenue by raising the annual membership fee of $95, but a City Hall source said that can’t happen until it fixes its operations.

Department of Transportation officials said that rather than raise rates, the program needs to capitalize on all the publicity it got in its first year to win new sponsors as well as private financing.

“If you’re sitting on the story of the year in New York City, you have a lot of opportunities,” a DOT official said.

Brooklyn City Councilman Brad Lander left the door open to public funding.

“Every other form of transportation receives some public subsidy,” Lander said, noting all other cities with bike-share programs subsidize the service.

He said he spoke to DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg about using taxpayer money and she “seemed open to it.”

Asked about this claim, a DOT spokesman referred to the mayor’s earlier statement.

Alta Bicycle Share said it was seeking outside investors.

Manhattan City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, who heads the Transportation Committee, said marketing could expand Citi Bike.

“City dollars should be a last resort only if we are unable to gather interest from new private partnerships,” he said.

He plans to introduce legislation next week that will require Alta to release its financial data.

Trottenberg said she’s confident Citi Bike would resolve its problems and even expand. It has a six-year contract with the city.

“We all know Citi Bike has been tremendously popular with New Yorkers,” she said. “But there have been significant financial and operational issues, including redistribution of bikes to where the riders are and technology issues.”

The Los Angeles City Attorney’s office announced March 14 it filed a lawsuit against Time Warner seeking nearly $10 million.

According to a statement released by City Attorney Mike Feuer, Time Warner has allegedly refused to pay fees to the municipality despite “raking in billions of dollars of revenue.”

“The City of Los Angeles enabled Time Warner to make billions and in turn they shortchanged the taxpayers millions,” Feuer stated.

ADVERTISEMENT

Specifically, the lawsuit seeks $9,697,896 from Time Warner, including more than $2.5 million in fees owed for 2008 and 2009, plus nearly $7.2 million for 2010 and 2011.

The money allegedly owed is for franchise Public, Educational, and Government (PEG) fees.

“Time Warner Cable … has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the City of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the City of Los Angeles … fully for this privilege,” the opening salvo of the 24-page complaint alleges.

City attorneys made two contentions to support its allegations against Time Warner.

“Time Warner enjoys a virtual monopoly for the provision of cable television services to the residents of the City, and it has blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the City resulting from the grant of that effective monopoly,” the complaint asserted.

The funds City Hall alleges have not been paid by Time Warner could have been used to pay for “core services,” such as fire and police protection, sanitation services, and operation of libraries, parks, and senior centers, the complaint continued.

Since 1986, City Hall has authorized “local cable franchises” divided into geographic segments within city limits.

“The Cable Act (and California law) permitted the City to require an operator to assume certain obligations in return for the non-exclusive right to occupy valuable public property – the rights-of-way – to build a system to provide cable,” the complaint stated.

In exchange for the “right to occupy valuable public property,” City Hall was authorized under the Cable Act (also known as the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984) to collect a franchise fee equal to five percent of the operator’s gross revenues.

The Act also allowed a city could enforce requirements for PEG facilities and equipment.

City Hall issued 12 local franchises to Time Warner, according to the complaint.

The complaint details City Hall’s relationship with Time Warner and how that relationship may have changed in light of new state legislation and a law enforcement action filed in 2008 by Los Angeles against the cable provided and alleging deceptive, fraudulent, and unfair practices.

Mike Dundas, a deputy city attorney, will oversee the litigation.###4974||Empty###4975||If water managers wielded a divining rod, the forked end would not point toward the heavens nor the Sierra Nevada. It would bend toward a major water source hundreds of feet beneath the Earth”s crust.

Indeed, with zero percent allocation from the State Water Project and a state mired in the third year of drought, even recent rainstorms can”t bring the familiar sources — aqueducts carrying water from Northern California — back to normal.

Instead, managers must find salvation in vast, underground lakes holding billions of gallons of fresh water stretching from the San Fernando to the San Gabriel Valley, from Southeast L.A. County to the West Basin and the Santa Ana River into the Inland Empire.

Once the man-made reservoirs run low — say by this time next year — water managers will depend on their last resort, the basins.

In short, water managers say they have enough supplies to get us through a third year of drought and a dusty summer without pressing the crisis button. But “Drought 2015” will become a game of aquifers and attitudes.

For example, jumping ahead a year, the city of Los Angeles may be in the worst shape.

Thirty years ago, Los Angeles received 70 percent of its water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct and 15 percent from both ground water aquifers and imported water purchased from Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Today, the numbers have changed dramatically to 40 percent from the L.A. Aqueduct, 10 percent from ground water and 50 percent from MWD, said Marty Adams, head of water operations at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Relying more and more on state water imported from Northern California is not a secure formula. This year, the agency celebrated the 100th anniversary of the L.A. Aqueduct. Hidden amid the fanfare was this statistic: the lowest amount of water came down the concrete channel in its history, Adams said.

In its heydey, the L.A. Aqueduct, which once turned Mono Lake into a salt flat, yielded 460,000 acre-feet of water. This year, it yielded 60,000 acre-feet, he said. An acre-foot of water is one acre of land covered in water 1 foot deep or about enough water for two families for a year.

In 2015, the LADWP will be forced to buy between 70 percent and 75 percent of its supplies from MWD, Adams said. The MWD reserves — stored since 2009, the year the last drought ended — are available at near 100 percent capacity at Pyramid Lake, Castaic Lake and Diamond Valley Lake in Hemet.

The only problem may be getting that water to the people in the San Fernando Valley, Adams said. “Their (MWD”s) biggest pool of water is not physically accessible to the San Fernando Valley but we can shift. We can make it work,” he said.

One of the angles is to clean up the ground water basin in the Valley, buy supplemental water from MWD, blend it with the aqueduct water and deliver it to customers. LADWP can also buy water from East Los Angeles that originated in the Colorado River and pump it through an underground pipeline beneath the Santa Monica Mountains to the west San Fernando Valley, he said.

Of course, Adams is concerned about using up all the reserves.

“Metropolitan has said they have enough storage for this year. The question is, how much do we use from those reservoirs? You want to use them very judiciously,” Adams said.

The biggest losers will be farmers that do not have contracts for water from the State Water Project or the federal Central Valley Project. Both have decided not to release water to any users not signed up. Also, allocations will be drastically reduced.

“I can”t impress enough how serious the situation is, particularly for agriculture in the state,” said Shane Chapman, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a wholesale water agency whose district includes about 1 million people.

About 1.5 million acres of land could be fallowed in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, he said. Farmers will not plant some crops in order to maximize high-profit crops, such as almonds and pistachios, he said.

The recent torrential rainstorms dumped 4 inches in downtown Los Angeles and brought the season total to 5.72 inches, about 49 percent of the average, said Bill Patzert, meteorologist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge.

“We are still 50 percent down. It is still a dry year,” he said

Rainfall in the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains was higher, but the runoff didn”t reach the underground aquifers.

“It didn”t help the drought at all. It is like trying to catch water in a champagne glass when someone is shooting a firehose at you. Most of it ends up in the ocean,” he said.

Adams would rather see the snow build up in Mammoth and the Eastern Sierra. But it will take close to 40 feet of snow there to return water supplies to normal, he said.

The Los Angeles County Flood Control District experts say they”ve been able to capture 100 percent of the water from the San Gabriel River during a normal year. That”s because the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers are mostly soft-bottomed, meaning they allow water to seep into the ground. Most of the L.A. River is concrete and impervious.

Water is captured in spreading grounds — areas of rock and gravel and berms — that like a sponge soak water into the underground aquifer. The most important aspect, aside from protecting homes from floods, is recharging the ground water, said Adam Walden, senior engineer with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works.

Unfortunately, Southern California”s basins are over pumped and abused. San Gabriel and San Fernando are peppered with contamination from years of dumping by the aerospace industry going back to the 1950s, rendering some wells inoperative.

“Ground water … is a diminishing resource as it is being pumped at rates that exceed current rates of natural recharge, leading to challenges related to saltwater intrusion, basin salinity, and increased need for imported water,” according to the Council for Watershed Health”s report on the Central and West basins.###4976||Shares of Symantec ( SYMC ) dropped 6% in after-hours trade on Thursday after the software security maker announced the removal of Steve Bennett as the president and chief executive officer.

Bennett took over Symantec's reigns in mid-2012 and initiated several organizational changes to counter the company's lower sales and profitability.

However, while the realignment of the organization's structure by eliminating several mid-level management positions bolstered the bottom line, sales force reorganizations have not yet yielded the desired results. On the other hand, Symantec's sales were impacted by the disruptions in customer relationships.

Moreover, the weak PC market is affecting the sales of Symantec's security solutions. As per the latest report from IDC, PC shipments will drop 6.1% in 2014, the third consecutive year of decline. This will affect the sale of Symantec's PC security solutions and business volume to a considerable extent.

To counter this decline, the company is concentrating more on the mobile business, which will enable it to generate additional volumes.

Nonetheless, Symantec reiterated fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 guidance reflecting that the CEO's exit would not have a material impact on the company's operations.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion reported in the year-ago period.

Non-GAAP operating margins are also unchanged at 24.5% to 26.0% compared to 24.1% last year. Management also expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 40 cents and 42 cents compared with 44 cents in the year-ago period.

Symantec is making efforts to attract small and mid-sized businesses with the introduction of enhanced versions of storage management and Internet security solutions. These solutions are primarily targeted at information-driven businesses.

However, the company faces increased competition from other bellwethers such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Intel ( INTC ).

Currently, Symantec has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock at this time would be Juniper Networks ( JNPR ), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).###4977||Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, hours after the country's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "eradicate" the social network in response to alleged recordings of him making corrupt statements being posted on the site.

Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, hours after the country's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "eradicate" the social network in response to alleged recordings of him making corrupt statements being posted on the site.

A number of incriminating wiretaps, including one in which Erdogan supposedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence during a police graft probe, have surfaced on the internet in the past weeks.

Erdogan denies corruption and says the recording was a fabrication. The leaks come at a particular sensitive time for the government with key local elections taking place this month.

Speaking at a rally on Thursday Erdogan said: "We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic."

By the early hours of Friday morning, the country’s 10 million Twitter users began to report access the site being blocked. They are now confronted with a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing court orders as reason for the site's closure.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban on her Twitter account as "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

"Turkish people and the (international) community will see this as censorship. It is," she s

Turkey has no current plans to block access to other social media platforms such as Facebook, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on Friday.

"The path was taken to block access within the framework of a court decision because of the failure to overcome the problem with the management of Twitter," the official said.

Independent News Service###4978||Indiana’s unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been since September 2008, but House Minority Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, said officials need to “take a longer look before gushing praise.”



According to the Department of Workforce Development in a report issued Monday, Indiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points, to 6.4 percent, in January. That is lower than all neighboring states and 0.2 percentage points below the national average.



“Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today’s unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a prepared statement. “Indiana’s rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow.”



The Hoosier state added 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector in January, the most in the country. But Indiana also lost 7,100 private sector jobs, leaving the state at a net loss of 2,500 jobs for the month.



“While others may gush about ‘the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,’ I look at the report and find myself wondering many things,” Pelath said.



He noted all but one of the state’s metropolitan statistical areas – and 82 of the 92 counties – actually saw unemployment rise in January.



“These disparities only serve to heighten the concern that many of us have about the so-called ‘job creation’ engine that the governor, his administration, and his super-majorities like to tout so often,” Pelath said.



But Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center, said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the recent administration’s job-creation strategies.



He said the Hoosier economy is closely tied to the national economy so these numbers may be result of the general economic upswing throughout the country.



But Conover also said Indiana has a “well-deserved” reputation as a business-friendly state. The legislature recently passed a bill that will give Indiana the lowest corporate tax rate in the country.



The lowering of the business personal property tax was one of the landmark items of the Pence agenda.



“With this legislative session’s accomplishments in cutting the corporate income tax rate, giving counties new tools for reforming the business personal property tax, and offering new opportunities for career education and retraining, we continue to work hard to ensure the future economic prosperity of our state,” Pence said.



The DWD – along with the U.S. Federal Reserve – cited January’s severe winter weather as one of the main reasons for a loss of jobs around the country.



Conover agreed with the assessment and noted that more than 9,000 jobs were lost in the areas of trade, transportation and utilities, and construction alone.



But that explanation was not enough for Pelath.



“People can talk about seasonal adjustments all they want, but I continue to be concerned about the raw employment and unemployment numbers,” he said. “Those tell me who has a job and who is able to take care of their family.”



Pence agreed that there is still more work to be done.



“Amidst this good news, we know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy,” he said. “Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve Indiana’s economic climate, to attract more jobs, and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future."###4979||Empty###4980||This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $10bn, it is understood.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400m.

Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

“It’s already kind of expensive as it is,” Todd Graham of Park Slope told CBS 2’s Janelle Burrell.

“I wouldn’t be surprised. $95 is not a lot of money for a bike to use all year long around the city whenever you want,” an annual member told Haskell. “Ninety-five dollars a year beats a MetroCard every month.”

Citi Bike Remains In The Red, Looks To Boost Daily, Weekly Ridership

The program currently currently has 99,000 annual members and an average daily ridership of more than 36,000 trips during the summer and fall.

But ridership took a worse-than-expected hit this winter, Burrell reported.

Operators are looking for more sponsors to provide a financial cushion. Citi Bike is looking at ways to attract more short-term users and expand into new neighborhoods.

According to reports, some Citi Bike workers have been laid off and there have also been operational problems.

Earlier this month, the New York City DOT Commissioner said all options are on the table when asked about a fee increase.

“A lot of people wont renew,” Kenneth Podziba, president and CEO of non-profit advocacy group Bike New York, told Burrell. “It’s just not working for tourists and I think people didn’t anticipate that when they made their projections.”

In other major cities like Chicago and Boston, where the bike-share programs are very successful, their annual membership is actually slightly less than what’s charged in New York. However, those bike-share programs are subsidized.

“There’s no public money. How else will it survive? You can’t rely on sponsors like Citibank and MasterCard to be there every year,” Podziba said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday cautioned the city is not in a position to bail out the bike-share program financially.

“Our transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, is gonna work with Citi Bike looking for ways that we can be in collaboration with them, find ways to make their operation more efficient, more effective,” said the mayor. “Our goal is to expand it farther out into the city and to the outer boroughs.”

Trottenberg added Friday that it’s her goal to get the service on sound financial and operational footing.

There are 6,000 Citi Bikes docked at 330 stations across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bike share program launched last May.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $10bn, it is understood.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400m.

Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

Reuters###4987||Empty###4988||Walmart’s new online tool could change the way people shop as well as how other retailers price their merchandise.

NEW YORK — The ‘‘Every Day Low Price’’ king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Walmart told the Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called ‘‘Savings Catcher’’ on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego, and Atlanta.

The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals, but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Walmart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart Store Inc.’s US discount division, said in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for ‘‘technological answers to saving them money and time.’’

Walmart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it is hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Walmart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread, and laundry detergent. But Walmart’s ‘‘every day low price’’ model is under attack by online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items for less. On top of that, the retailer’s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Walmart’s US discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health. The discounter has also seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Walmart has had a pricematching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Walmart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. By last summer, Walmart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets.###4989||This will appear next to all of your comments

“The Chinese ambassador received satellite image of floating objects in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify,” Hishammuddin Hussein said at a press conference two weeks after the flight went missing.

The object China photographed is 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide, or 74 feet by 43 feet, the minister said.

The country provided the satellite image to Australia, which ramped up its search of the plane this week.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority announced that it had plotted the position of the object and found that it fell within the area it searched on Saturday. Officials said the object was not spotted in the search.

Only a number of small objects, including a wooden pallet, were sighted during Saturday’s search.

The search for the plane will resume on Sunday, Australia’s government said.

Beijing has already dispatched two planes to Australia and will send two more ships to join five already searching the southern corridor, CNN reported.

Asian markets were down across the board today (March 20th) on the back of the latest suggestion interest rates could soon be increased in the US.

After chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen stated that rates might be put up by the body next year, markets such as the Nikkei were down.

Ms Yellen took over as chair of the Fed towards the end of last year, replacing Ben Bernanke in the role. She was the preferred candidate of US president Barack Obama to take the leadership of the body.

The Fed has continued to wind down its bond-buying programme and Ms Yellen suggested interest rates could be increased from zero per cent six months after that scheme has come to an end.

Markets down

These comments from the Fed's chair hurt Asian markets, with the Nikkei down by 1.65 per cent over the course of the session following her press conference. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite were also down on the back of Ms Yellen's statement, with each suffering from a loss of more than one per cent.

Peter Redward, of Redward Associates, suggested that the impact of an increase to US interest rates is not going to be the same in Asia as it will be in some of the world's emerging markets.

"We're going to see the type of reaction we've seen in other emerging markets which means interest rates are probably going to climb as well," he told the BBC, suggesting the first Asian country to increase interest rates could be the Philippines.

Mr Redward added: "The issue for Asia is that the US isn't the locomotive for this region that it once was. The rise of China and the relative decline of the US means that it just isn't going to pull the region forward like it has in the past."

A rise in US interest rates could put pressure on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to increase the UK's base rate, which has stood at a record low of 0.5 per cent for the last five years.

The website, which matches up travellers and people with rooms to rent, is reportedly close to securing a private fundraising at a valuation for the whole business of $10bn.



That would make it more valuable than either Hyatt ($8.4bn) or IHG ($8bn), despite the fact that both these firms have substantial international networks of physical assets (hotels to you and me), while Airbnb doesn’t own so much as a single bed.



It also makes Airbnb the joint most-valuable VC backed start up on the planet, alongside Dropbox and Chinese smartphone biz Xiaomi, despite the fact that the firm has never disclosed either its revenue or profits. Co-founders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gabbia - who started the firm only six years ago in San Francisco - will become the sharing economy’s first paper bilionaires.



The funding round is expected to net between $400m and $500m, and is being led by TPG (the private equity group behind car-sharing outfit Uber’s fundraising last year). Airbnb, which claims to have hosted over 11m guests since it began, is expected to use the money to expand into peer-to-peer cleaning and transport services.



Given that the firm’s last fundraising two-and-half years ago valued it at a mere $2.5bn, this new round is being seen as a major endorsement for the sharing business model. (Read MT's recent feature on the business of sharing).



But novel and thrifty as it is, this modus operandi is not without perils, as a steady stream of punter horror stories attest. Take this one from the Sydney Morning Herald about an airbnb rental in New York used to host a ‘sex freak party’, resulting in eviction and a bill for $87,000 for the apartment’s hapless tenant.



Such glitches aside, the valuation - coming as it does only a month after Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp - will certainly add to fears that a big bubble is inflating in the tech sector. If and when it bursts, it won’t just be the shareconomy that feels the pain…

George Osborne will announce a new design for the £1 coin in today’s Budget. The new 12 sided coin, modelled on the old threepenny bit, will be introduced in 2017.

The Chancellor will say that the current coin, which has been in circulation for thirty years, has become susceptible to forgery, and the Royal Mint estimates that £45m worth of forged £1 coins are in circulation today.

The new coin will be the most secure coin in the world – as secure as modern bank notes – and will save taxpayers’ money from being used to combat fraud.

Now read:###5006||Empty###5007||France provided new satellite data Sunday showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a wooden pallet that could yield clues to one of the world's most baffling aviation mysteries.

The new data consists of "radar echoes" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed what might be debris from the plane, French authorities said.

Flight 370 vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search that has turned up no confirmed pieces and nothing conclusive on what happened to the jet.

The latest satellite data came to light as Australian authorities coordinating the search, conducted about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of different lengths and colors.

The pallet was spotted on Saturday from a search plane, but the spotters were unable to take photos of it, and a PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate it could not find it.

"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center. He added: "It's a possible lead."

Wooden pallets are often used by ships, Barton cautioned. But he said airlines also commonly use them in cargo holds.

An official with Malaysia Airlines said Sunday night that the flight was, in fact, carrying wooden pallets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with company policy.

AMSA said it has requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines.

When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface, and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud," Royal Australian Air Force flight Lt. Russell Adams told reporters.

Nothing of interest was found, he said. But he added that the search was worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."

In Paris, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said in an interview with The Associated Press that the satellite radar echoes "identified some debris that could be from the Malaysian Airlines plane."

The spokesman said that these echoes "are not images with a definition like a photograph, but they do allow us to identify the nature of an object and to localize it."

"The French government has decided to increase its satellite monitoring of this zone and try to obtain precise images and locations," Nadal said.

Gathering satellite echo data involves sending a beam of energy to the Earth and then analyzing it when it bounces back, according to Joseph Bermudez Jr., chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis, a commercial satellite intelligence firm.

Satellite radar echoes can be converted into an image that would look similar to a black-and-white photo, though not as clear, he said. "You'd have to know what you're looking at," Bermudez said.

A Malaysian official involved in the search said the French data located objects about 930 kilometers (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet), said the official, who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board.

In the U.S., Tony Blinken, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, said on CNN: "There is no prevailing theory."

"Publicly or privately, we don't know" what happened to the plane, he said. "We're chasing down every theory."

Missing Plane Search Area: Distant, Dangerous, Dazzling###5008||It was handbags at dawn yesterday and the bloodied loser was Mulberry boss Bruno Guillon, who paid with his job for meddling with middle England's favourite handbag-maker.

The Somerset firm announced Guillon's departure with "immediate effect" after the firm's attempt to chase the spending power of high end shoppers on New York's Fifth Avenue and Hong Kong's Causeway Bay alienated the John Lewis crowd back home – who were its most loyal shoppers, even if they had to save up for months to buy one of its soft leather bags.

In a terse statement to the stock exchange, the company's chairman Godfrey Davis said he was returning to lead the business and thanked the Frenchman for his hard work.

That "hard work" included engineering a slump in sales and profits that has seen the company's stock market value crash from £1.5bn to just £400m.

His two year reign also saw the departure of Emma Hill, the creative genius who was credited with bringing about the brand's renaissance in the first place, with bestselling designs such as the Alexa – a satchel named after presenter Alexa Chung – and the Del Rey, dedicated to singer Lana Del Rey.

It has been reported that Hill, who had previously worked for Burberry and Marc Jacobs, did not agree with Mulberry's push upmarket and her important position remains vacant.

Davis politely insisted that Guillon, who joined from Hermès in 2012, had improved the quality of the Mulberry offering and increased its appeal in overseas markets. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he said.

Four years ago, when Davis was still running Mulberry, he told the Guardian it was a "grave mistake for luxury brands to think all their customers are super-rich". He drilled into staff the importance of being friendly to customers and the firm's internal mantra "we don't believe in bad manners, fashion egos or size zeros" was an antidote to austere Bond Street boutiques.

Back then, Mulberry's classic Bays-water bag, costing £500, was within touching distance for many British women. Today, after Guillon introduced more exotic finishes such as ostrich skin, they start at around £900. Its smallest bag – a clutch style wallet measuring 11cm by 20cm – costs £495, while keyrings run to £100.

Having watched Burberry's success over the last decade, Guillon was eyeing the $390bn global market for designer clothes and accessories, where well-heeled shoppers do not bat an eyelid at a four- or five-figure price tag. Recent initiatives include a collaboration with model Cara Delevingne unveiled at London fashion week and included a bag inspired by her lion tattoo.

But with more than 60% of Mulberry's sales rung up in the UK, its traditional shoppers were priced out of the market and have since defected to fast-growing brands such as Michael Kors and Coach whose arm candy are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals.

When Guillon took over in 2012 Mulberry could do no wrong for shoppers or investors. It was the sleeper success of the luxury goods sector, having quietly metamorphosed from a staid brand, adopted by the green welly brigade in the 1980s, into a fun and unpredictable label capable of conjuring up "it-bags" that "it-girls" such as Chung were happy to sling over their shoulders. Like many brands it owes a debt to Kate Moss, a friend of Hill's, who lit a fuse in the fashion press when she stepped out with a Bayswater in the crook of her arm a decade ago. Moss's patronage proved a turning point for the brand, putting it on the radar of Grazia readers.

Lorna Hall, head of retail at trend consultancy WGSN, said it can be very hard for fashion brands to move upmarket and even more so in the glare of the stock market where executives are forced to publish regular sales updates. "When you make this kind of shift there is always a danger of alienating your existing customers," she said. "Mulberry has made a big shift in its prices. It had customers who were willing to pay £500 but they won't go above that. She was Mulberry shopper - not a Louis Vuitton or a Chanel shopper."

Davis has rescued the brand before. He took charge in 2002, when after years of losses, Mulberry's biggest shareholder, the Singaporean billionaire Christina Ong, ousted the founder, Roger Saul, in a bloody boardroom coup. History repeated itself on Thursday but there were no tears, from investors anyway, with the shares closing the day up more than 5%.###5009||Empty###5010||Empty###5011||McDONALDS TO GET 47% REDUCTION IN GRAFTON STREET RENT - McDonald's fast food chain is to have its rent reduced by 47% on Dublin's Grafton Street less than two weeks before the Supreme Court is due to review a separate High Court ruling that the rent on another Grafton Street café, Bewley's, must be allowed to fall in line with the depressed open market rate. The background to the two rental arrangements are entirely different, writes the Irish Times. McDonald's has negotiated a lower rent under a new lease agreement while the Bewley's lease is still subject to five yearly upwards-only reviews. McDonald's had been paying an overall rent of €1.15 million under a 35-year lease which ran out at the end of 2011. That figure has now dropped to €600,000 and with upwards-only clauses no longer allowed, five yearly reviews are now based primarily on open market rental values. The landlords in this case - Royal London Mutual Life and Pension Fund - had indicated in advance of the review that it would also be looking for a premium of at least 30% on the rent to take account of the scarcity value of having a round-the-clock food business on the city's premier high street and also because of the sheer size of the building - it extends to 1,858sq m (20,000sq ft). Natalie Brennan of CBRE said the issue of the premium "was factored into the discussions and was taken on board". Grafton Street earned a reputation during the property boom for being one of the most expensive high streets in the world.

BANK OF IRELAND TO SCRAP 'DELEVERAGING' ROLE FOLLOWING DONOVAN'S RETIREMENT - Bank of Ireland will not appoint a new head of its "non-core division" following the retirement of previous head Denis Donovan, the Irish Independent has learned. As well as heading up the unit, Mr Donovan sat on the group executive committee, the team under chief executive Richie Boucher that oversees the day-to-day running of the bank. Following his retirement the role of head of group non-core division is "no longer required", according to an internal memo sent to staff and seen by the newspaper. The group non-core division was responsible for meeting a "deleveraging" target set for the bank, which included selling off €10 billion of international loan assets, as well as being charged with the bank's management of NAMA loans. Its understood the decision not to appoint a senior manager to replace Mr Donovan reflects the fact that much of the unit's work has already been completed. Instead, the bank has appointed two senior managers as new members of the group executive committee, according to the memo.

'NO FIRMS HIT BY TAX CLAMPDOWN' - Not a single company has contacted the tax authorities to say they have been affected by changes announced in the budget as part of Finance Minister Michael Noonan's clampdown on international tax avoidance, reports the Irish Examiner. In October's budget, Mr Noonan included a measure that required any company incorporated in Ireland to be tax resident either in this country or another jurisdiction. Multinationals had been exploiting a loophole in the Irish tax system that enabled them to incorporate companies here that were not tax resident in any other state. In response to a parliamentary question from Michael McGrath, Fianna Fáil's finance spokesman, Mr Noonan said no companies had been affected by this change. "I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not, to date, been advised by any company that is or will be affected by the change in residence rules as to where it is actually resident following the announcement of the change in the budget," he said. Mr McGrath said he was "amazed" that not a single company had been hit by the rule change.

OSBORNE LOSES POUND AND FINDS THREEPENCE - George Osborne is to scrap the current £1 coin and replace it with a 12-sided version reminiscent of the old threepenny bit, in a Budget move that may appeal to the patriotism and nostalgia of a key section of the electorate. The chancellor took a personal interest in the design of the new coin, whose retro-look will incorporate anti-forgery features which Mr Osborne claims will make it the most secure coin in circulation in the world, says the Financial Times. In a Budget with little money for populist “giveaways”, Mr Osborne’s back-to-the-future coin may turn out to be one of the biggest talking points of his statement. Mr Osborne says the current £1 coin, which has been in circulation for over 30 years, is increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters so that about 3% of all the coins in circulation are fakes. In his role as Master of the Mint, Mr Osborne will announce plans for a replacement coin to be introduced in 2017, of bimetallic construction and of two colours, but crucially with 12 sides. Treasury officials admit the coin’s resemblance to the old threepenny bit has little to do with security and everything to do with nostalgia; the new design is a reincarnation of a coin that was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation 1971.###5012||OK

Investing.com - German economic sentiment deteriorated sharply in March, dampening optimism over the health of the euro zone's largest economy, industry data showed on Tuesday.

In a report, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment tumbled by 9.1 points to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to fall by 2.7 points to 53.0 in March.

The Current Conditions Index improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February, missing expectations for an increase to 52.0.

Meanwhile, the index of euro zone economic sentiment dropped to 61.5 in March from 68.5 in February, worse than expectations for a decline to 67.3.

On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.

Following the release of that data, the euro added to losses against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD shedding 0.22% to trade at 1.3892, compared to 1.3913 ahead of the data.

Meanwhile, European stock markets remained lower. The EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.5%, France's CAC 40 declined 0.2%, Germany's DAX shed 0.6%, while London's FTSE 100 inched down 0.3%.###5015||Why did this happen?

It has caused an uproar among Turkish citizens, who are finding ways get around the ban, Turkey's own president, and now the White House.

The Obama administration condemned the ban in an emailed statement on Friday, stating that blocking Twitter undermines a citizen's "ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association," and "runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world."

Erdoğan said Thursday he wanted to "eradicate" Twitter, but the block seems to have backfired: Turks have sent 1.2 million tweets within the country since the block, using various circumvention tools — including IP addresses being spread via graffiti.

The White House statement, issued by Press Secretary Jay Carney, reveals that the U.S. government has "conveyed" serious concern over the situation.

"We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information," Carney wrote.

Erdoğan said on Thursday that he doesn't care what the international community says. The United States and Turkey have remained friendly in recent years, based on a personal rapport between President Obama and Erdoğan. But that relationship has strained in recent months, according to analysts, after disagreements on Egypt — Turkey backed ousted President Mohamed Morsi — and Syria, when the U.S. decided not to launch a military operation.

The full White House statement is below:

The United States is deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools. We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world. We have conveyed our serious concern to the Turkish government, urge Turkish authorities to respect the freedom of the press by permitting the independent and unfettered operation of media of all kinds, and support the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies.

UPDATE, 4.30 p.m. ET: The U.S. State Department echoed the White House in condemning the ban, with its own statement.

The United States supports freedom of expression in Turkey and opposes any action to encroach on the right to free speech. We urge the Turkish Government to unblock its citizens’ access to Twitter and ensure free access to all social media platforms.

The new data consists of "radar echoes" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed what might be debris from the plane, French authorities said.

Flight 370 vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search that has turned up no confirmed pieces and nothing conclusive on what happened to the jet.

The latest satellite data came to light as Australian authorities coordinating the search, conducted about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of different lengths and colors.

The pallet was spotted on Saturday from a search plane, but the spotters were unable to take photos of it, and a PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate it could not find it.

"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center. He added: "It's a possible lead."

Wooden pallets are often used by ships, Barton cautioned. But he said airlines also commonly use them in cargo holds.

An official with Malaysia Airlines said Sunday night that the flight was, in fact, carrying wooden pallets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with company policy.

AMSA said it has requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines.

When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface, and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud," Royal Australian Air Force flight Lt. Russell Adams told reporters.

Nothing of interest was found, he said. But he added that the search was worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."

In Paris, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said in an interview with The Associated Press that the satellite radar echoes "identified some debris that could be from the Malaysian Airlines plane."

The spokesman said that these echoes "are not images with a definition like a photograph, but they do allow us to identify the nature of an object and to localize it."

"The French government has decided to increase its satellite monitoring of this zone and try to obtain precise images and locations," Nadal said.

Gathering satellite echo data involves sending a beam of energy to the Earth and then analyzing it when it bounces back, according to Joseph Bermudez Jr., chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis, a commercial satellite intelligence firm.

Satellite radar echoes can be converted into an image that would look similar to a black-and-white photo, though not as clear, he said. "You'd have to know what you're looking at," Bermudez said.

A Malaysian official involved in the search said the French data located objects about 930 kilometers (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet), said the official, who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board.

In the U.S., Tony Blinken, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, said on CNN: "There is no prevailing theory."

"Publicly or privately, we don't know" what happened to the plane, he said. "We're chasing down every theory."

The Morning Glory tanker was due to arrive later on Saturday at Libya's government-controlled Zawiya port after being seized by U.S. commandos and escorted back through international waters by the U.S. Navy, Libyan officials said.

Hours before the handover, at least 16 people were wounded when Libyan rebels occupying three eastern oil ports clashed with troops and attacked an army base, where pro-government forces had been preparing to break the rebel blockade.

Anti-aircraft gunfire and explosions were heard overnight and after dawn on Saturday in Ajdabiya, the hometown of rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran, whose fighters seized the ports last summer to demand a greater share in Libya's oil resources.

The struggle for control of Libya's vital petroleum resources is one of the key challenges facing the weak central government, which has still failed to secure the North African country three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.

Brigades of former anti-Gaddafi rebels and militias refuse to disarm and often use armed force or control of oil facilities to make demands on a state whose army is still in training.

U.S. special forces boarded and seized the Morning Glory tanker last Sunday off Cyprus, days after it left Libya with a cargo of crude from one port, Es Sider, occupied by Jathran's men who had vowed to export oil themselves to resist Tripoli.

"The handover took place in international waters off the coast of Libya, and the Government of Libya and its security forces are now in control of the vessel," the U.S. embassy said in a statement.

Once the Morning Glory docks, crude from the tanker will be fed into Zawiya refinery, which has been forced to lower its production because of a protest at another oil facility, the El Sharara oilfield, officials at Zawiya port said.

Zawiya port is 55 km (34 miles) west of the capital Tripoli.

The Tripoli government gave Jathran a two-week deadline on March 12 to end his port blockade or face a military assault, though analysts say Libya's nascent armed forces may struggle to carry out that threat.

Jathran's self-declared Cyrenaica government is demanding more autonomy for his eastern region. Attempts to broker a deal between the rebels and Tripoli have so far failed.

LANA state news agency said tribal community leaders helped stop the fighting earlier on Saturday between the rebels and Libyan soldiers. But the agency reported 16 people were wounded.

SPLITS, RIVALRIES

After months of threats, Jathran's federalist gunmen managed to load crude onto the Morning Glory tanker. The ship left port and escaped Libya's navy, embarrassing Tripoli's government and prompting parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

The seizure of the tanker in international waters was a rare boost for the government, which has struggled to end a standoff that has cost the state more than $7 billion in lost revenue.

The three rebel-held ports account for around 700,000 barrels per day of Libya's oil export capacity, or around half of its total petroleum shipments.

The town where Saturday's battle broke out, Ajdabiya, is divided between Jathran supporters and those who fear his oil blockade will lead to the collapse of the state.

But any major assault on the three ports may bolster support for Jathran's cause for a federalist state.

Tripoli's government is also stymied by infighting among Islamists, secular parties and tribes that has delayed Libya's transition to democracy since the fall of Gaddafi, whose one-man rule left few state institutions.

Western governments, which backed NATO's air strikes to help the 2011 anti-Gaddafi revolt, are training Libya's armed forces and are pressing the factions to reach a political settlement.

A new shape for the £1 coin has been revealed which is said to be the most secure coin in the world.

The new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one, but has 12 edges and is both gold and silver coloured.

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983. There are concerns that it has become too easy to copy illegally.

The royal mint

It's thought around 45million fake £1 coins exist. The new coin will be introduced in 2017.

The Queen's portrait appears on one side of the coin and a competition will be held to decide what goes on the other side.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, said: "It is our aim to produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting."###5024||If you change your mind, here's how to allow notifications:

* Fed expected to continue tapering its bond-buying stimulus

* Focus on UK jobs data, annual budget (Updates levels, adds comments)

By Anirban Nag

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen and euro on Wednesday, drawing comfort from expectations the Federal Reserve will further unwind monetary stimulus, looking beyond the impact on the economy of a harsh winter.

Some trepidation before Janet Yellen’s inaugural policy review as Federal Reserve chief will keep gains muted, traders said.

The Fed is widely expected to reduce the size of its monthly bond purchase programme by a further $10 billion at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Yellen, widely regarded as a dove, is due to address a news conference later in the day.

Most are focused on the Fed’s forward guidance on policy. Most expect it to assure investors that rate hikes are a long way off despite the unemployment rate easing faster than expected.

The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 101.625 yen, staying above a one-month low of 101.20 yen hit on March 3. The euro fetched $1.3917, down 0.1 percent on the day but not far from Thursday’s peak of $1.3967 - a 2-1/2-year high.

“The key thing will be whether there will be any change in the timing of rate hikes by the Fed from next year,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.

“I am not convinced the Fed is ready to materially change guidance and we will see a very even-handed Yellen. All of which leaves investors looking to second-quarter U.S. data before taking fresh positions in the dollar.”

The Fed has said it would not raise interest rates until joblessness fell to at least 6.5 percent, a pledge policymakers thought would hold until at least mid-2015. But it hit a five-year low of 6.6 percent in January, before rising to 6.7 percent in February.

Expectations Yellen will pursue a broadly dovish stance have helped rein in U.S. Treasury yields, which in turn has undermined the attraction of the dollar for bond investors.

“Many investors had probably expected the dollar to strengthen this year because the U.S. economy looked in better shape than others,” said Katsunori Kitakura, associate general manager of market making at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.

“But their positioning has probably been damaged by the Ukraine crisis and poor economic data due to bad weather, and that’s probably a reason for the dollar’s struggles recently.”

UK FOCUS

Some of the focus in Europe will be on the British pound. It was up 0.1 percent at $1.6615, with more gains likely if UK jobs data at 0930 GMT shows more signs of robust recovery.

The number of people out of work is expected to have fallen by another 25,000. Wages are expected to have risen 1.2 percent year-on-year - an increase but well below inflation.

“Attention will be on wage growth and that along with a good jobs number could push sterling higher,” said CIBC’s Stretch.

Later, attention will shift to the annual UK budget. Finance minister George Osborne is expected to stick to his tough plan to fix the public finances and this will keep the onus on the Bank of England to keep monetary policy loose to ensure growth.

And while the safe-haven yen lost ground, investors remained cautious over tensions in Ukraine. Anxiety eased somewhat after Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine, a day after Crimean citizens voted to be annexed by Moscow.
