0|Empty##1|Empty##2|Empty##3|Empty##4|(Kitco News) - Gold rose to its highest level in nearly six months Wednesday on the combination of geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine, worries about bond defaults in China and technically oriented buying.

As of 9:23 a.m. EDT, gold for April delivery was $17.90, or 1.3%, higher at $1,364.60 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It peaked at $1,367.30 an ounce, its strongest level since Sept. 20. May silver was up 25 cents, or 1.2%, to $21.065 an ounce.

“I think what we’re having here is continued nervousness about…the EU (European Union) situation – where the fear of deflation is again taking hold – along with continued worries about the situation in Crimea and the Ukraine leading people into the gold market,” said Sterling Smith, futures specialist with Citi Institutional Client Group.

“Gold seems to be playing its alternative currency card here at the moment,” Smith continued. “We’re seeing most currencies generally steady to a little bit weaker. Gold is one of the few positive items we have out there.”

Gold has also drawn technically oriented buying, Smith said. The metal broke above last week’s $1,355 high and also took out the highs from late October just over $1,360 an ounce. Buy stops were hit, Smith said.

“It’s still coming on the back of the uncertainty in the global economy,” said Mike Dragosits, senior commodity strategist with TD Securities. “China has not been doing particularly well in terms of economic data. And, they had their first-ever corporate default (Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.) within the country and now there are rumors that there is a second one on the near horizon. I guess the question is – where does it go from here and how many more are we going to see?”

This is adding to the safe-haven bid for gold, he said.

“Then you also have the underlying story of the Russia-Ukraine situation,” Dragosits said. “It still has not gone away.”

Ukraine’s Crimea region has been overrun by Russian troops. A referendum has been scheduled in Crimea for Sunday on whether to unite with Russia.

“Russia has said they will recognize it (the referendum) and basically the rest of the world has said they won’t recognize it,” Dragosits said.

A New York desk trader said gold is continuing its bounce from double-bottom support at the end of last year. April gold fell as far as $1,182.30 on New Year’s Eve, coinciding with the low of $1,179.40 from June on a futures continuation chart.

“It’s established a long-term support area and is simply bouncing off of that,” he said. “We have the equivalent of a double-bottom.”

Traders are coming back into the precious metal, encouraged by crises such as the Ukraine issue, he said.

Afshin Nabavi, head of trading with MKS (Switzerland) SA, put the next resistance for gold around $1,375. For now, he put support around $1,340 to $1,345. He said some longs may opt to take profits after the run-up.

Gold’s rally is “quite impressive” considering the weakness in many other commodities, Smith said. He pointed out that crude oil is lower, most grains other than wheat are softer, and coffee and cocoa are under pressure.

Who needs churches or priests to keep the proletarian masses distracted from their oppression when you can keep their attention fixed on the challenge of matching digital candies together on the small screen? Karl would have heard the news that King.com, the developer of "Candy Crush Saga" was shooting for an initial public offering (IPO) valuing the company at $7.6 billion and nodded. Total enthrallment of the working classes? Cheap at the price!

Let's take a trip through the reality-distortion field that is the current tech boom. "Candy Crush Saga" is an addictive pattern-matching puzzle game that is free to download to your phone. It is a trifle, a divertissement, a way to while away the minutes waiting for the bus or between subway stops. There's no way to sugarcoat this: The pleasure derived from "Candy Crush Saga" is more fleeting and superficial than the joy delivered from sucking on a Sweet Tart. There is nothing socially redeeming, or even interesting about the game.

Did I mention it was addictive? Yes, so much so that players of "Candy Crush Saga" will willingly pay for extra lives or other in-game assistance whenever they get stuck on hard levels or just can't stand the torment of being forced to wait a few minutes for new lives to spawn. The genius of "Candy Crush" is that once you've used up your available "free lives" the game actually restricts you from playing for an arbitrary period of time ... unless you pay up.

The strategy works: In 2013, King.com raked in over half a billion dollars in revenue from in-game fees. "Candy Crush Saga," therefore, only pretends to be free. It is, in fact, one of the most insidiously perfected machines for monetizing distraction and impatience ever invented.

If you're thinking that there's a metaphor at work here describing something essential to how the tech boom is metastasizing, congratulations -- you just made it to the next level! If all goes well with King.com's IPO, a company that pretends its main product is free will be worth billions of dollars.

But time is of the essence! According to Bloomberg News, "King’s average monthly unique players declined to 12.2 million in the three months to December from 13 million in the third quarter, according to the prospectus." The masses are already losing interest. King.com needs to get its IPO accomplished as fast as possible. When the current tech boom reaches its inevitable business cycle downturn, extra lives are going to get a lot more expensive.##7|Empty##8|Empty##9|Sign up for one of our email newsletters.

SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

“He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.

“Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.##10|The US state of Colorado adopted a law allowing the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business at the beginning of this year. It was the first state to do so. Other states, such as Washington intend to follow suit, especially as Colorado collected the whopping $2m (£1.2m) in taxes from recreational marijuana businesses in January alone. This sum rises to $3.5m if you count medical marijuana firms.

The money will go toward financing youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to the plan of the governor of Colorado.



Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.

Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver.



US President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to halt punitive measures against banks that do business with cannabis firms, saying that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol. He did warn that both were bad decisions.

Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.##11|Mercedes-Benz is looking to further improve fuel economy and reduce emissions by possibly introducing a three-cylinder engine into its cars.

Speaking to Car and Driver at the Geneva Motor Show last week, Mercedes powertrain chief Bernard Heil believes three-cylinder engines are doable in certain vehicles thanks to increased space and better packaging if they’re mounted transversely.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels. Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

At this point, it’s unclear whether a three-cylinder hybrid powertrain would appear in smaller vehicles, such as the B-Class, CLA-Class and GLA-Class, but Hiel maintained we won’t see a larger Mercedes with a three-cylinder in the future.##12|Empty##13|Empty##14|Before the suit deal got sewn up between Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. and Men’s Wearhouse this week, both companies raised or poo-poo’ed antitrust concerns as it suited them amid the jockeying over whether they would merge and who would be the buyer.

How real is the risk now that they want a deal done? There’s heat for sure. The Federal Trade Commission previously requested more information from the companies about their possible combination, a signal that the agency plans to take a detailed look at the transaction.

An important question in the FTC’s review will be whether it believes the two companies compete in a market that is more specialized than the broad men’s apparel market. If the commission concludes the companies do compete in a different space than retailers like Macy’s, Kohl’s and J.C. Penney, then the merger partners could face a more-difficult government review, said Darren Tucker, an antitrust lawyer with Bingham McCutchen LLP and former FTC staffer.

“The FTC sometimes segments markets in ways that can appear counterintuitive to the public,” Mr. Tucker said, pointing to past cases in which the FTC found distinct markets for premium grocery stores, super-premium ice cream and high-end vodka.

Mr. Tucker said the commission likely will test whether there is a separate market for specialty men’s retailers, or for mid-range men’s apparel. “If either of these is a distinct market, you could foresee that the companies would have a sizable share of that market,” he said.

The commission’s analysis, he said, will largely turn on how the companies have viewed the market in their own ordinary-course business documents.

Mr. Tucker said both companies are in the uncomfortable position of having raised antitrust concerns to talk down a bid by the other company. “The FTC certainly will be interested in this, but will recognize the context in which the statements were made,” he said.

Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP and another former FTC staffer, said despite the companies’ chest-thumping about antitrust issues during the heated deal process, “it’s hard to see a real strong basis for challenging the deal.”

Mr. Kanter said there were many discount clothing stores already, along with low barriers to entry for new competitors that might want to sell discount suits. “From an antitrust perspective, it’s hard to see a market narrow enough for these companies to have really high market shares,” he said.##15|Empty##16|Empty##17|You are the owner of this article.##18|Empty##19|Empty##20|Why did this happen?

Mt.Gox had been one of the leading exchanges for the virtual currency. But last month it went bankrupt and halted operations, with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoins gone missing.

The site is not letting customers trade or make withdrawals from their accounts. Mt. Gox says customers can and should check their account balances. But that doesn't mean they'll be able to recover any of those funds during the upcoming bankruptcy proceedings.

Related: I lost money with Mt.Gox

"This service is provided on this site only for the convenience of all users," said a notice on the Mt. Gox website, which went on to say that the amount listed is not an acknowledgment by Mt.Gox that customers are owed that amount. It also said the method for filing claims will be published on the site soon.

How Mt.Gox went down

Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan on Feb. 28, with debts totaling $64 million.

Three weeks earlier it had halted withdrawals from customer accounts after discovering that its trading platform was under attack by hackers.

Trading was halted and the site shut down a few days before the bankruptcy filing. Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily froze the U.S. assets of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.##22|As the crisis in Ukraine shows little sign of letting up, one of the long-term consequences could be the rejigging of Europe’s energy policies, European leaders have been warning.

Talks had already begun to take place between European politicians and the US over the potential of increasing US natural gas imports, Britain’s foreign secretary William Hague said at the weekend. “I believe that there will be a recasting of the European approach,” Hague told the BBC, warning of the “inadvertent” and “unintended” consequences of the tensions between the West and Russia.

US ambassadors to the Visegrad 4, a group made up of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, have called on US Congress to ease the regulations for shipping US natural gas in a bid to reduce dependence, reported website EurActive on Monday.

Meanwhile Europe’s Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger told Germany’s Die Bilt newspaper that negotiations over the South Stream pipeline -- one of several efforts to increase the number of transit routes for Russian gas to Europe – would be delayed.

Russia currently accounts for around a third of Europe’s natural gas imports. Past disputes between Ukraine and Russia – including in 2006 and 2009 when Russia temporarily cut supplies through Ukraine during the crucial winter months impacting European supplies – have brought this dependence into the spotlight.

There have been a number of initiatives to cut dependence on Russian gas: for example, BP is involved in a project in Azerbaijan that will bring Caspian Sea gas reserves directly to Europe, bypassing Russia. However to date little has been done to change the overall balance, with policy varying from one country to the next.

“I would say there has been diversification from Russia but it’s a slow process, and the determination of some countries to do so is somewhat stronger than others,” says Andrew Neff of IHS Global Insight. He points to the fact that there has been a resurgence in demand for Russian gas, over North African (Libyan) and Norwegian sources. “Russia has been seen as more reliable.”

Initiatives such as the Nord Stream Baltic pipeline running to northern Germany, has meant that last year “we saw more Russian gas to Europe last year, and less through Ukraine,” he adds.

Moving away from Russian gas presents a number of problems for Europe, and particularly for landlocked countries, which are dependent on the policies of neighbouring states. Alternatives such as shale gas are also limited given the reluctance of many European governments to get involved.

The current tensions over Crimea have the potential to instigate a change in energy policy towards shale gas in Europe, in much the same way that the Fukushima disaster in Japan led Germany to move completely away from nuclear power but only if they lead to a major supply disruption to Europe, argues Neff.##23|Katherine Braun sorts packages toward the right shipping area at an Amazon.com fulfillment center in Goodyear, Ariz (Ross D.

Amazon will raise the price of its Prime membership to $99 in a bid to boost the company's income through its flagship product.

In an email to Prime members, Amazon identified rising fuel and transportation costs along with a growing stable of products eligible for the program's unlimited two-day shipping as factors in the price increase. Amazon Prime currently costs $79 per year.

New Prime members will begin paying the higher price on March 20, while existing members will begin renewing at $99 on April 17. The student price for Prime will rise $10 to $49 per year. It is the first price hike in Prime's nine-year history.

Investors welcomed the news, as Amazon shares rose 2.9 percent to $381.44 in morning trading. But the stock remains down more than 4 percent in 2014 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that missed revenue expectations.

Prime is a logical place for Amazon to look for an increase in cash flow, particularly as its primary sales of various consumer products relies on thin margins amid fierce competition. Amazon claims to have around 20 million Prime members.

RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said they project between $300 million to $400 million generated by the price increase with minimal loss of existing customers.

“We acknowledge that not all Prime users will adopt an increased membership fee – however, based on our recent conversations with Costco, we don't believe that [Amazon] will see a material increase in Prime sub churn as a result of the increased membership fee,” he wrote in an analyst note.

A price increase was first floated by the company during the most recent investor call following the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. The $20 price increase is on the lower end of what Amazon CFO Tom Szkutak discussed.

Amazon noted that its growing media library, much of it included in Prime, now counted 40,000 movies and TV episodes as well as 500,000 e-books available for lending. It has also been reported that Amazon has been in talks to add streaming music to its media offerings.

“We are working to expand selection even further, as we develop additional fulfillment and transportation capacity to make the Prime program even more valuable to our members,” an Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable.

While Prime's original selling point was its two-day shipping, the media offerings from Amazon have slowly begun to rival other streaming outlets like Netflix.

Amazon's shipping is already fast — standard shipping arrives in an average of 3 days, 10 hours, according to consumer service analytics firm StellaService. Depending on how much a person orders from Amazon, having a package arrive 36 hours earlier may not be worth $99 per year.

But Prime is no longer just a shipping product. Amazon has begun to morph it into the company's primary consumer-facing product with a variety of features.

“Netflix is one set of things and Amazon Prime is a lot more than that,” said

David Smith, an analyst with Gartner. “I think it comes down to people being comfortable with the company, with the value they have already received.”

The price increase brings Prime closer in price to other competitors. At $99 per year, the service costs $8.25 per month, making it slightly higher than the $7.99-per-month of Netflix and Hulu.

Prime content may not be of the caliber of Netflix or HBO Go, but Amazon is working on that, with original series and content licensing deals with CBS. Extant, a thriller produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television and starring Halle Berry, will be available on Prime just four days after airing on TV.

And with Amazon prepping the launch of its entry into the streaming set-top box market, Prime will conceivably be put front and center of the company's first foray into living rooms across the country.

UPDATE (3/10/14): Chrysler confirms the temporary layoffs of its workers at the Belvidere plant will extend into this week. It's expected they'll return to work March 17.



BELVIDERE -- Chrysler reports the nation's bitter winter weather has been great for Jeep sales but not so good for the sales of its compact Dodge Dart, which is assembled in Belvidere. As a result, the company is laying off employees.



In a statement, the company says, "Chrysler Group’s Belvidere Assembly Plant (Ill.) is adjusting its production schedule during the week of March 3, 2014, in order to balance vehicle supply with current sales demand. This action will result in the layoff of 325 employees on all three crews." The layoff is scheduled to last for this week only.



Overall, the company is doing well, reporting an 11% increase in sales in February, 2014 over the previous year. It's the company's best February sales performance since before the Great Recession.



Jeep drove sales, with the brand posting a 47% increase over the previous February. The Jeep Compass is also assembled in Belvidere.



“The severe weather has been ideally suited for our legendary Jeep 4x4 capability as Jeep brand sales were up 47% and the brand had its best February sales ever,” said Reid Bigland, Head of U.S. Sales in a news release. “Overall February was another solid month for Chrysler Group as our total sales were up 11% and we achieved our 47th-consecutive month of year-over-years sales growth.”



Except for the Dart. The issue with sales is that the Dart is Dodge's only compact offering in a segment where buyers tend to look at brands which offer more small car variety, such as Kia, Honda and Toyota.

That's despite the fact the Dart has been recognized as a really good car. Dodge noted in a news release on Monday it has once again been selected as a 'Best Bet' by the 2014 edition of 'The Car Book.' Dodge reports the vehicle scored a '9' on a scale of '10' overall when analyzed for crash test results, safety features, rollover rating, preventative maintenance schedules, repair costs, warranty coverage, fuel economy, complaint data and insurance costs.##26|Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which begs the question - how often do people tip their baristas?

NEW YORK – Next week, Janet Yellen will chair her first meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (March 18-19) and once again tapering will be at issue. Will the Fed continue to decrease the flow of its fountain of stimulus – from $75 billion since January, presumably down to $65 billion after this session – until the tapering finally tapers away sometime before 2015?

Odds favor it, but then in the United States the debate has moved on. Solid job figures, manufacturers’ surveys, producer prices – and of course the stock market – all point to an economy ready for weaning, even if Yellen cares more about the long-term unemployed than her predecessor.

But the rest of the world, particularly that segment known as the emerging markets, is angry. The concerns given voice in January by India’s central bank chief, Raghuram Ragan, that the gradually diminishing flow of hard currency into emerging market economies due to tapering betrayed a lack of foresight or even ingratitude on the part of the Fed strikes many Americans as absurd.

The US public suffers from a profound fatigue after failed interventions and an economic downturn that appears to have torn away many of the props that exaggerated the boom that preceded it. The idea that the nation’s monetary policy should be concerned with anything but American interest simply does not rate.

While this attitude accurately reflects America’s mood – and there is something to be said for pointing to the crocodile tears streaming from the faces of emerging market central bankers – in the longer-term this courts serious risks for the United States. Outside an apology for tapping their phones, or perhaps for creating a precedent in Iraq for Vladimir Putin’s moves in Ukraine, Americans may well feel they owe little else to BRICS leaders whose triumphal summits and incessant crowing about “the end of the American century” has failed to ingratiate them here.

The Fed has, in fact, taken great pains to telegraph its tapering to minimize (though not eliminate) disruptive surprises. The idea that tapering should simply continue unabated – or that the Fed is bound by its “forward guidance” not to raise rates until the end of 2015 irrespective of the state of the American economy – is absurd. For all its global clout, the Fed – like the US military, Google and the Internet governance group ICANN – are American institutions most attuned to US interests and priorities. (Indeed, if tapering does continue, it will be because of the debate over its merits in terms of support to American growth, not any benefits it provides to emerging market competitors).

Nonetheless, Americans should not assume this means they have no responsibility to measure the impact of US monetary policy on other nations. Besides the obvious question of contagion through lowered returns and regulatory chaos affecting US multinationals and emerging market investment funds, there are profound long-term risks in blithely taking for granted the enormous benefits America’s economy garners from the fact that most of the world’s trade is denominated in US dollars.

The “exorbitant benefit” of issuing the world’s reserve currency – as a former (presumably resentful) French leader once put it, is much debated. But most economists agree that there are significant advantages to issuing the dollar – in effect, a capital gains effect of between 1 percent and 6 percent. More simply, the price Americans pay for most commodities (oil, for instance, or food) is just a bit lower than the same commodity purchases with, say, Indian rupees.

More importantly, because the Fed alone controls the number of dollars in circulation, America can sustain policies – like the near-zero federal funds rate that has prevailed since the financial crash – that would have global bond markets baying for the blood of any other nation. These low rates effectively lower the ultimate return-on-investment foreign creditors will receive for purchasing American debt through the sale of US Treasury bonds and other government securities.

But these perks of global dominance will erode along with America’s hegemony, and erratic or insensitively propagated policy measures in Washington will speed the arrival of that day whether they emanate from Congress, the White House or the Fed.

Already global markets are chirping, led by China and Russia, that the dollar be supplanted as the global reserve currency by something else. There has always been a good measure of resentment in these pronouncements, and people laughed aloud when then-President Dmitri Medvedev suggested the ruble as an option in 2010. But there are viable options, too – a basket of currencies, the IMF’s “special drawing rights” vehicle, or, God forbid, Bitcoin.

Does issuing the reserve currency impose on the US certain responsibilities? Yes, but mostly these are consistent with self-interest (including the one that says, “Don’t run around threatening to default”).

The fact is, no rulebook or international compact governs the responsibilities of the central bankers who happen to set policy for the world’s global reserve currency. If such a book existed, after all, it would have been torn up time and again – in 1931, when Britain ditched the gold standard, in 1944 when the Bretton Woods deal was sealed, and again in 1973, when the US finally followed Britain and embraced a floating, fiat currency. Yet another new print run would have followed the 2008-2009 crisis as central banks, led by America’s, embraced the unorthodox policies that unleashed the tidal wave known as quantitative easing that is only now beginning to diminish.

BRICS leaders and others had their complaints then, too: Dilma Rousseff, for instance, complained repeatedly after taking office in 2011 that the “expansionist” Fed policies were hampering Brazilian growth and stoking inflation.

So it is that calls for the US Federal Reserve to consider the effects of tapering on emerging markets tend to fall on deaf ears in the United States. But Americans should not kid themselves. Just as there is no rulebook for managing the global reserve currency, it is nowhere written in stone that the US dollar will remain in that position in perpetuity. As in so many other things since the turn of this century, America must balance its justifiable desire to pursue its own national interest against the burdens of its still unrivaled place in the global economy. To do otherwise will merely hasten the day when the desire for an alternative to the greenback moves from a mischievous outlier to a global consensus.

The investigators are reportedly examining how GM handled reports of faulty ignition switches, which were first revealed in 2004, and why the company did not react sooner to fix the problem, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The investigation will also address the question of whether GM tried to mislead federal regulators about the extent of its problems that led to the production of faulty switches, which reportedly caused cars to shut down unexpectedly and disabled the airbags.

“It’s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,” Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a private watchdog group said, according to the Times.

Detroit-based GM, which is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter, reportedly announced this week that Anton "Tony" Valukas, the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block will lead the internal probe, according to Reuters.

A Department of Transportation spokesman said in a statement, according to Reuters: "We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall."

The GM recalls involve six models that are not being currently produced -- 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices; and the 2007 Saturn Sky -- and the company could be charged up to $35 million in fines by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, if GM is found guilty of not reacting promptly to the complaints, Bloomberg reported.

The initial recall on Feb. 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s and widened to include a further 800,000 vehicles within the next two weeks.

GM stock plummeted 5.15 percent on Monday at close.

“The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share,” RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said, according to Reuters. “Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM.”##33|A pedestrian passes by sale signs on a store front window in Chicago.

In a possible sign of how consumers' mood has soured over a long, bitter winter, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell this month to its lowest level since November.

The index reading was 79.9, down from 81.6 in February and 82.5 in December. Its most recent high was 85.1 in July.

The weaker level, combined with the surprise 0.1% drop in producer prices for February also reported Friday morning, may both be at least partly weather related, said Michael Englund, of Action Economics.

Consumer sentiment "faces headwinds from economic disruptions related to harsh winter weather, Obamacare, and lingering concerns after last year's mortgage rate spike and government shutdown," Englund said in an analysis after the report.

He predicted the final reading later this month will show a smaller decline.

Weather has slowed the economy, holding back construction, manufacturing, business hiring and other activity, but economists are uncertain how much effect it has had. Many say it may take a couple months before a clear picture of the economy's real health emerges.

Senior staff will be made millionaires overnight, with investors such as Midlands-based chairman Mel Morris, who provided the initial £100m from the sale of his dating site uDate, set to own £523m in shares from his 12.2% stake.

Co-founder and chief executive Riccardo Zacconi will own £455m worth of shares from a 10.4% stake.

A total of 11 other investors will own £1.4bn in shares between them.

Previously the company was involved in a dispute with an independent games maker after he claimed King stole the concept for Candy Crush.

NOW READ:##35|The huge stock offering planned by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is being prepared for New York, media reports said Friday.

The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, said Alibaba had decided on New York after ruling out Hong Kong and London for the initial public offering.

The reports did not indicate whether the IPO would be on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.

Alibaba was not immediately available for comment.

The company's stock market listing was expected to raise about $10 billion, which would make it the technology industry's largest IPO since Facebook's in 2012.

The Journal said that an IPO filing could come as soon as April, which could allow trading to begin by the third quarter.

The report said up to five banks may be given lead underwriting roles.

Last year, talks between the world's largest online retailer and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange broke down in part because the city's listing rules prevented Alibaba's founder Jack Ma and senior management retaining some control over the board of directors.

Alibaba was hoping the exchange would adopt an alternative class share structure to give select minority shareholders extra control over the board, but the city's bourse refused to shift from its current mechanism of one share, one vote.

Alibaba operates China's most popular e-shopping platform, Taobao, which has more than 90 percent of the online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions.

Taobao has more than 800 million product listings and over 500 million users.

Some reports say Alibaba is also preparing a US e-commerce site.##36|Empty##37|News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services##38|Why did this happen?

Were they panicked that a massive recall of GM products would undermine one of President Obama’s most self-congratulatory campaign themes – that he “saved” Detroit’s auto industry?

This is a tale of two car companies: GM, shining star in President Obama’s reelection galaxy, and Toyota, which became political fodder.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee announced two days ago that it would undertake an investigation into why it took GM until quite recently to address a decade of complaints about stalling problems with several car models, and why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not demand a recall of the troubled lines earlier on. Reports of unexpected stalling in Chevy Cobalts began to trickle in as early as 2003 when 7 incidents were relayed to NHTSA, according to The New York Times.

RELATED: GM FACING NEW PROBE BY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS



By 2011 there had been 204 complaints lodged. In 2010 then-Congressman Barney Frank inquired on behalf of a constituent about the multiple accidents apparently brought on by the random deceleration issue. He was told by NHTSA that it had “insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation.” By that time, there had been several fatalities related to Cobalts’ stalling. Still, NHTSA did nothing.

At the same time, after the Obama administration had orchestrated a government takeover of General Motors, NHTSA hit Toyota with its largest-ever fine and demanded a recall of some 9 million cars and trucks. Over several years, NHTSA had received more than 3,000 reports of sudden acceleration in Toyotas; there had been some 75 fatal crashes. Though the incidents of problems continued to mount, it was not clear at the time of the recall what exactly accounted for the mishaps. The Wall Street Journal announced that a report attributing most of the accidents to driver error had been “temporarily blocked” by safety officials, acting under the direction of Secretary of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.

George Person, who was not personally involved in the Toyota investigation, and who recently had retired as head of Recall Management, said that the safety overseers had investigated 40 incidents in which sudden acceleration had been cited as the cause of a crash; in 23 of those, the cars’ “black boxes” indicated that the drivers had stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake.

RELATED: CAN MARY BARRA MAKE GM THE NUMBER ONE CAR COMPANY?

Mr. Person accused NHTSA of withholding the report for fear they would be accused of being too lenient with the auto maker. “It has become very political…” Mr. Person was quoted as saying. He claimed that agency managers were “hoping against hope that they find something that points back to Toyota .”

The events surrounding the recall were indeed “political.” In March 2010, Congress held showy hearings on the Toyota safety issues. In his opening statement, Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia boasted, “We have dedicated an entire day – we’ve never done that before that I can remember – to one subject…” – reviewing the Toyota affair. Senator Mark Pryor used his opening statement to reassure listeners that “this is not a witch hunt.” All this – even though it was still not clear that Toyota’s vehicles were defective.

Meanwhile, back in Detroit , evidence of problems in various GM cars – and especially the Chevy Cobalts -- continued to mount. To date, the auto maker has reported 13 deaths related to sudden deceleration in various GM models. While the government is now questioning why the Detroit firm delayed initiating a recall of the troubled vehicles, one can also challenge NHTSA’s hands-off attitude.

According to The Times, there were only 260 complaints specifically mentioning stalling, but almost 8,000 reports of problems that could be tied to the same defect – plenty of complaints to alert safety watchdogs. In all, the vehicles recalled have been involved in 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries.

RELATED: THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR BIG 3 AUTOMAKERS

Finally, last month, GM initiated a recall of 1.6 million Chevy Cobalts, Saturns, and Pontiac G-5s for faulty ignition switches; NHTSA has (finally) launched a widespread investigation, threatening civil and never-before levied criminal penalties.

Why would the Obama administration sanction such a tough crackdown on Toyota, while leaving GM in peace? Certainly, the White House wanted GM to succeed. Having handed out $86 billion in bailouts to GM, Chrysler and GMAC, Cash for Clunkers, the Warranty Commitment program, the Supplier Support program, $41.5 billion in TALF loans for auto finance companies, loans from the DOE for electric car development, Recovery Act funding for battery makers and research monies funneled though the Advanced Research Projects agency, the White House had gone all-in on the success of Detroit.

Having forced through the bankruptcy of GM, under terms that many considered excessively generous to the UAW and unfair to creditors, President Obama had much on the line.

RELATED: ORGANIZED LABOR GETS ‘NO’ VOTE AT VOLKSWAGEN PLANT

The timing of the attack on Toyota may have been coincidental, and the company’s management may have been slow to respond to complaints. For sure, Toyota ’s reputation and its market share took a beating from the safety scare. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, close pal of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, poured gasoline on the fire when he advised Toyota owners to "stop driving their cars and take them to their dealers” – a comment that he later walked back. Toyota’s U.S. sales plunged nearly 9 percent in February 2010, in part because the manufacturer suspended production of Camry sedans, the country’s number one seller. Its competitors, including GM, enjoyed a consequent boost in sales.

Emergence of safety issues attracts hungry lawyers, plaintiffs and accusations, muddying reputations and records. We will likely never know for certain whether the government intentionally protected GM and its investment in Detroit’s success, or whether NHTSA was simply inept.

Unhappily, after the IRS targeting of right-wing groups, the manipulation of jobs numbers by census workers, the misleading accounts of the Benghazi tragedy and the deceptive marketing of Obamacare, we have lost trust in President Obama’s White House. Anything seems possible.

BEIJING -- China announced on Saturday a modest easing of exchange rate controls that have been criticized by Washington and other trading partners, adding to a flurry of reform initiatives aimed at making its slowing economy more efficient.

The range in which the tightly controlled yuan is allowed to fluctuate against the dollar each day will double in size, though to a still relatively narrow 2 per cent.

The move was widely expected after Premier Li Keqiang promised in an annual policy speech last week to give market forces a "decisive role" in allocating credit and other resources in the state-dominated economy.

The ruling Communist Party says it wants to inject more competition into the economy and nurture self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

In a steady drumbeat of recent changes, authorities also have announced plans to create China's first privately financed banks and promised to ease the tax and regulatory burden on entrepreneurs.

Widening the trading band will help to "optimize the efficiency of capital allocation and market allocation of resources to accelerate economic development," the central bank said in a statement.

The U.S. Treasury Department had no immediate reaction to the announcement.

China's rapid economic growth tumbled to a two-decade low of 7.7 per cent last year. This year's official growth target is slightly lower at 7.5 per cent, but Li said this week Beijing will be flexible about it as long as the economy generates enough new jobs.

Washington and other governments complain Beijing suppresses the value of the yuan, unfairly making Chinese exports cheaper abroad and hurting foreign competitors.

The relatively small size of Saturday's change appeared unlikely to mollify Beijing's foreign critics. Some U.S. lawmakers have demanded punitive tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing failed to ease controls, but the White House has resisted imposing sanctions.

Beijing reported a $260 billion global trade surplus last year, a $30 billion increase over 2012 and among the largest ever recorded by any country.

Chinese leaders say they plan eventually to let the yuan float freely, but private sector analysts say that might be decades away.

Beijing is reluctant to allow big changes in the currency for fear of hurting exporters that employ millions of workers. But analysts say they might have gained confidence from recent strong trade performance.

Allowing the yuan to rise in value would increase the buying power of Chinese households, helping to achieve the ruling party's goal of nurturing more sustainable economic growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

A stronger yuan also could help to suppress pressure for politically sensitive consumer prices to rise by making imports cheaper.

Reform advocates say that by suppressing the yuan's value, Beijing has been forcing even poor households to subsidize exporters.

In recent weeks, the central bank has been guiding the yuan's exchange lower against the dollar in what analysts said was an effort to discourage speculators who are moving money into China to profit from the currency's rise.

Beijing allowed the yuan to gain about 20 per cent against the dollar beginning in 2005 but movement stopped after the 2008 global crisis as the government tried to protect struggling exporters.

The yuan has been trading at about six to the dollar. Analysts say Beijing might allow that to rise to 5.88 to the dollar by mid-2014, a rise of about 2 per cent. That would be small by global currency market standards but unusually large for China.##42|TRIPOLI - A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were escorting it to port on Tuesday, MPs said.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," said a member of the General National Congress, the country&39;s highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC&39;s energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel&39;s escape and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

A government source and a spokesman for Libya&39;s state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel&39;s escape when contacted by AFP.

Libyan authorities had said late on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for ex-rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading Al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil but the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, is the first to actually do so.

The standoff at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5-million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country&39;s key revenue earner.##43|Mercedes-Benz has announced that it has started the local assembly of the W222 S-Class at its manufacturing facility in Chakan, Pune. The new batch of these locally assembled cars will also get the benefit of lowered prices and the S500 is now priced at Rs 1.36 crore (ex-showroom Mumbai) as opposed to the launch price of Rs 1.62 crore (ex-showroom Mumbai). Besides this, Mercedes-Benz has also announced a new ‘Chauffeur Training Program’ for chauffeurs of its new S-Class customers to train them on their soft skills and make them aware of the car’s features.

Merecedes-Benz has made this move due to the strong demand for the new CBU S-Class after they managed to sell out their initial inventory of 125 units in just 16 days after the car’s launch. The German manufacturer has started accepting bookings for the S500 and the deliveries of the new batch will commence from June.

Eberhard Kern, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India said, “The S-Class truly embodies our DNA and aspiration of ‘the best or nothing’ in every aspect. We are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the art production facility in Chakan, Pune. This reiterates our commitment to bring world class manufacturing facilities in India to support our growth in the luxury automotive business.”

The Chauffeur Training Program is a 21 module unique multilingual course for chauffeurs of S-Class across India. This course is designed to train the chauffeurs to drive the new S-Class with ease and properly utilise the luxury features of the car for the benefit of its owners. The program also focuses on imparting skills like soft spoken skills, etiquette and safety to the drivers. Speaking about the program, Mr. Kern further added, “It is also our constant endeavor to incorporate our brand promise and drive excellence in every aspect of our business and customer engagement. The unique multilingual chauffeur training program is one such initiative specially designed for our discerning S-Class customers in India, which will enable our customers to truly enjoy the epitome of luxury on wheels.”

High-end luxury cars have always been Mercedes-Benz’s forte and with the new S-Class, the company has made its point again. Despite the high price tag, the new S-Class is quite a hit in the country, and with the lowered price tag, Mercedes-Benz has made the package even more attractive. India has emerged as an important market for the Stuttgart-based manufacturer and it achieved a growth of 32.5 per cent for 2013. With its ‘Year of Excellence’ strategy, Mercedes-Benz is hoping to keep breaching the records and overtake Audi as the best-selling luxury car marquee in India.##44|Malaysia Airlines MH370: Co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid spoke last words from missing plane, chief says

Updated

Malaysia Airlines says the co-pilot of the plane that disappeared 10 days ago spoke the last words from the cockpit - "All right, good night".

An unprecedented search operation has failed to find any trace of flight MH370, which investigators believe was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.

Suspicions of sabotage or hijacking heightened when officials revealed the final message, which came about the time two of the plane's crucial signalling systems were manually disabled.

During a press conference last night, Malaysia Airlines chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya was asked who had spoken the words.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot [Fariq Abdul Hamid] who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape," he said.

Officials said the last signal from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that sends back data on the plane's status - was received 12 minutes before the seemingly nonchalant final words.

The plane's transponder - which relays radar information on the plane's location - was switched off just two minutes after the voice message.

The sign-off went against standard radio procedures, which would have called for the pilot to read back instructions for contacting the next control centre and include the aircraft's call sign, said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways pilot and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his co-pilot have become a primary focus of the investigation into the fate of the missing Boeing 777-200ER.

On Saturday, police special branch officers searched the homes of both men in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport.

Malaysian officials said detectives had been looking at any financial or personal pressures on the pilots, who had both passed psychological screenings to get their jobs.

Investigators were hunting for clues as to why someone on board the plane flew it perhaps thousands of kilometres off course.

It had not yet been ascertained who was controlling the aircraft when the communications systems were disabled.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, acting Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: "We are looking at it."

But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.

Meanwhile, background checks of the 239 passengers - among them six Australians - have drawn a blank.

Search 'like trying to find a needle in Texas'

What happened in the cockpit may remain unknown unless the plane is found, and finding it is a daunting challenge.

The search for the missing flight now involves 26 countries and covers a vast area from Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

Australia has been handed control of the southern Indian Ocean search which began west of Perth early today.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Question Time today that the Air Force has so far completed two sweeps over the Indian Ocean and another is due to take place later in the day.

Mr Abbott says aircraft from New Zealand and the United States are also heading to the area, and soon there will be four RAAF Orion aircraft helping with the search.

"We owe it to the people on this ill-fated flight and their families to do what we can to solve this tragic mystery," the Prime Minister told Parliament.

China, France and the US were yesterday asked to provide more satellite data and Malaysia has also called for even more ships and planes to join the search.

The director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, Andrew Herdman, says the search is "like trying to find a needle in Texas".

"At the moment you're looking for a needle in a football field, as someone in the American military said, or a needle in Texas, if you take the current zone," he told 7.30.

He believes the plane is likely to have taken a southern route.

"I would have thought the southern corridor was more likely on the grounds that if it had gone the northern route, it would have passed over a lot of land area and a lot of radar establishments ... [and] military radar would likely have picked something up," he said.

"And if the aircraft had landed or crash-landed anywhere on land in those areas, it's quite likely we'd have seen some sign of it or heard some evidence that that was what happened.

"If it took the other route and headed into the Indian Ocean, this is a vast expanse of sea and it'll be much more difficult to find signs as to what happened to the aircraft."

Malaysia's handling of the situation has attracted criticism, but Malaysia Airlines chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya says he is encouraged by the search effort.

"For the families, I understand that every day prolongs the anguish. I understand because Malaysia, too, is missing its sons and daughters. There were 50 Malaysians on board the plane," he said.

"Over the past two days, we have been recalibrating the search for MH370. It remains a significant diplomatic, technical and logistical challenge.

"Malaysia is encouraged by the progress made during such a short period of time. We are grateful for the response by the heads of government that we have spoken to, all of whom have expressed a commitment of assistance.

"With support from our many international partners, this new phase of the search is underway. Assets are being deployed, and search and rescue operations have begun. I wish to thank our partners from around the world for their continued support."

That rally encouraged capital to flow into the country betting on a steady increase in Chinese interest rates, which made Chinese assets relatively attractive given the weakness of the dollar.

Many Chinese importers even inflated their receipts to bring in more cash to speculate on the yuan, which repeatedly and massively distorted the country's trade figures in certain months.

However, since the beginning of 2014, the central bank's action has pushed the currency down 1.6 percent. While that is not a major move for many currencies, for the yuan it marked a bigger slide than the currency posted over six months during the Greek debt crisis in 2012.

Moving markets

In pushing the yuan lower, the risk was that traders bullish on the yuan would see the weaker levels as a buying opportunity.

However, foreign exchange traders said that the yuan continued to fall in recent weeks and stay closer to the central bank's midpoint, even though state-owned banks had stopped intervening, indicating many bulls had been shaken out of the market.

A senior money manager for an international investment fund in Shanghai, who spoke off the record because of the sensitivity of relations with regulators, said that the wider trading band would likely discourage foreign investors.

"It's what China needs to do, and the smart money says, OK, this is great, this is two way, we'll have more money coming in and out. But for the next tier of investor, they see China as very hairy still, not a lot of transparency, and the only news is bad news. They don't look at this as good news they just look at it as more volatility."

Currency analysts said the shake out of bullish positions cleared the way for the PBOC to widen the trading band without worrying that the currency would immediately leap to test the upper limits of the new range.

"Conditions for a band widening were ripe," said Li Heng, economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing.

Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai, said that allowing the yuan to trade in a wider range each day and so respond more to market forces would make the currency more attractive internationally.

"China needs to internationalise the yuan and a 1 percent fluctuation cannot adequately reflect market demand for and supply of the yuan," said

Beijing wants to expand the Chinese currency's footprint beyond Hong Kong, where more than 80 percent of yuan trade settlement transactions are handled, and foster greater confidence among offshore businesses to adopt the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as a currency for trade.

Its efforts have paid dividends so far, with the yuan already overtaking the euro to become the second-most used currency in trade finance, data from global transaction services organisation SWIFT showed.

The central bank's announcement follows rising concerns about the implications of slowing growth in China, with some warning that Beijing might have to ease up on the pace of long-term structural market reforms aimed at migrating China to a more sustainable model.

"That the central bank chose to widen the band right now shows, in some ways, that it is confident about the economy," Shenyin Wanguo's Li said.

(Read more: China's economic growth more like 4%: Marc Faber)

How the wider band will play into Beijing's efforts to reduce debt and wasted investment while maintaining enough growth to keep employment stable is an open question.

Although widening the trading band is aimed at introducing more two-way price swings into the market, the last change in April 2012 - doubling the band to 1 percent - largely failed to do so.

Instead, the spot price consistently traded near its strongest permissible level after briefly heading lower following the band widening.

"The market will welcome the PBOC's move, but it will also ask one question," said a trader at a European bank in Shanghai.

"The yuan's midpoint is now the base rate for the currency's daily movements. That means if the PBOC sets the midpoint far off from market rates, the market actually has no role in deciding the yuan's exchange rate."##47|Alibaba plans U.S. flotation By By Tim Sandle Mar 16, 2014 in Business Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has announced plans for a flotation in the U.S. The aim is to extend the global reach of the tech company.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise - the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.



"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."



Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.



Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased six percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained nine million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.



Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.



Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.



"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."

Reuters



China's carbon prices surged this week as demand firmed ahead of an upcoming deadline to report 2013 emissions data, indicating the markets may be less over-allocated than feared.



Spot permits in four of China's regional pilot emissions trading schemes rose between 5 and 12 per cent this week, although market participants cautioned against reading too much into the numbers as liquidity remained low.



"More companies are now coming to the market knowing their positions after calculating their 2013 emissions. This has pushed up the prices," a market participant told Reuters.



Companies in the markets must report their 2013 carbon dioxide emissions to local regulators by the end of March or April, and then surrender the equivalent number of permits to governments by the end of May or June.



In the Shanghai market, permits rose 8.9 per cent over the week to 40.30 yuan ($6.59). Demand mostly came from oil and chemical companies, while major manufacturers and power generators remained on the sidelines, the participant said.



In Tianjin, prices shot up by 11.7 per cent to 33.20 yuan, Shenzhen saw a 6.1 per cent rise to 85.80 yuan, while in Beijing, spot permits were at 55.18 yuan, up 5 per cent for the week. The Guangdong market was untraded, as it has been since Dec. 20.



This week's price hikes follow stable rates in all regions since the turn of the year.



Analysts had feared permit prices would drop due to over-allocation in China's new carbon markets that rely heavily on companies' own emissions data.



But volumes traded remained low as many firms have yet to allocate funds to participate in the markets.



The Shanghai price rise came on the back of 38,000 permits being traded, while none of the other markets saw more than 6,000 permits change hands on the official exchanges.



However, the Beijing Energy and Environment Exchange said on Friday that three deals totalling 42,000 permits at undisclosed prices had been negotiated off the exchange. Companies involved in larger bilateral deals are not required to publish prices.



One source said the Shanghai volume was helped by a conference this week where high-level officials urged companies to start trading.



The Shenzhen market was launched last June, with the other schemes following in November and December. According to industry analysts, many of the covered companies are yet to come up with strategies on how to deal with climate regulations.##61|Empty##62|TOKYO (AFP) - Toyota said on Monday it has suspended production at its two Indian auto assembly plants in response to threats against management and "deliberate" assembly-line stoppages, following failed efforts to reach a labour deal.

The world's biggest automaker said the lock-out of about 6,400 employees at the factories in southern India came after "certain sections of the employees...resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors, thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days".##63|Goldman Sachs analysts believe gold's unexpected rally this year will soon fade despite renewed enthusiasm among the hedge fund community.

Hedge funds and other speculators expanded bets on higher prices for a fourth week in New York futures and are now the most bullish since December 2012, US government data showed late last week.

The net-long position in gold climbed 3.8% to 118,241 futures and options in the week ended 4 March, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed.

Short holdings were down 15% to 26,321, the lowest since October. Net-bullish holdings across 18 US-traded commodities rose 9.7% to 1.59 million contracts, the most since the data begins in June 2006.

However, while gold has logged its best start in six years after topping $1,350 an ounce, Goldman's Jeffrey Currie said the odds were increasing that prices would drop to $1,000 for the first time since 2009.

The turmoil in Ukraine does not alter Goldman's bearish view on gold, and the recent weakness in the US economy is probably weather driven, not "real deterioration," said Currie, the bank's head of commodities research.

Lower mining costs mean it was more probable than it was six months ago, that prices would drop below $1,000, Currie told Bloomberg.

"The gains have been impressive," said Chad Morganlander, a fund manager with Stifel Nicolaus, which oversees assets worth about $150bn. "There's been a perfect storm of geopolitical uncertainty as well as growth scares here in the US."

"Some kind of middle-ground solution in Ukraine is probably the case at some point," said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which manages $115bn.

"For the two big commodities, oil and gold, we've probably seen relative highs for the next month. Once this geopolitical risk premium ebbs, I don't see a lot of fundamental speculative support to push gold a lot higher," Haworth told the news agency.

Weekly Gains

US gold futures for delivery in April gained 1.26% for the week ended 7 March.

American employers added 175,000 jobs in February after creating 129,000 new positions in January. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 6.7% from a five-year low of 6.6%, government data showed.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected non-farm payrolls to increase by 149,000 and the unemployment rate to remain steady at 6.6%.

The US service sector, which account for almost 90% of the economy, grew at the slowest pace in four years in February, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed on 5 March.

The China Gold Association has said that the demand in the nation, the world's leading consumer of the yellow metal, is poised to drop to 250 metric tons this quarter, down 17% from a year ago.

Billionaire Paulson

Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who holds the biggest stake in SPDR Gold Trust, reported gains in his firm's main strategies last month partly as bets on gold paid off.

Holdings through gold ETPs rose in February for the first time since 2012. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest such fund, are up 0.9% in 2014 following a 41% drop in 2013 that wiped $41.8bn in value.

Bullion has gained some 11% this year amid indications of weakening US economic growth and the ongoing standoff between Russia and the Ukraine.##64|Libyan officials say they have taken "complete control" of a North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil at a port occupied by rebel forces.

prices ended substantially higher on Wednesday, 12 March 2014. Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with solid gains and hit a six-month high as more safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish posture prompted buying interest. Gold futures rallied on Wednesday to mark their highest settlement since September, buoyed by tensions in Ukraine and a pullback for the equities markets linked to concerns over a slowdown in China's economy.

Gold for April delivery rose another $23.80, or 1.8%, to settle at $1,370.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its third-straight session climb.

May silver jumped 54 cents, or 2.6%, to $21.36 an ounce.

The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. This coming weekend could be pivotal in this geopolitical crisis. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. The Group of Seven nations was set to release a statement on Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. economic data released Wednesday was again light and did not impact the markets. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Index, which fell 2.1% to follow last week's increase of 9.4%

In other news on Wednesday, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank's monetary policy. The ECB has been battling tepid EU economic growth and deflationary concerns with a very stimulative monetary policy.

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company’s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don’t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn’t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there’s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke said. At the drive-thru location where she works, for instance, she said tips go down when it’s cold out and people are less likely to reach out and put money in the secured tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview. There are no plans to bring the mobile tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn’t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they’ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — The Federal Reserve has said again and again that it wants to keep interest rates low for a long time. But it keeps fiddling with how to express that commitment.

Another shift in that communications strategy is set to occur when the central bank’s interest-rate-setting committee gathers for two days of talks on Tuesday and Wednesday, as it’s the first meeting to be led by Janet Yellen, the new chairwoman. The Fed will release a policy statement and updated economic forecasts at 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, and Yellen will hold a press conference at the end of the deliberations at 2:30 p.m.

Also read: Fed transparency boils down to 16 dots on a page

With the Fed and the markets basically on the same page on the economy, the current near-zero interest-rate policy, and the rate of reduction in bond purchases, the central bank has an opportunity to revamp its forward guidance tool, now the chief policy instrument.

“They’ve got a little room to unanchor these things,” said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York.

So-called forward guidance attempts to drive down long-term rates by promising to keep short-term rates low for a long time.

The Fed has reworded its pledge throughout the financial crisis. Alexander said the early forms of forward guidance were simpler as the Fed was simply saying that it was a long way from raising rates. See interactive timeline of Fed’s forward guidance.

The Fed’s current pledge is to hold rates steady until “well past” the point when the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%.

But the unemployment rate has steadily dropped over the past year, before ticking up slightly to 6.7% in February.

“It is time to seriously rethink that 6.5% unemployment target because we are so close to it,” said former Fed governor Randall Kroszner in an interview with MarketWatch.

Yellen has signaled that she would be comfortable with this change, analysts said, when she told lawmakers last month that the unemployment rate did not fully summarize the health of the labor market.

Experts don’t think the Fed will simply lower the threshold to a 6% unemployment rate. Instead, the prevailing view is the Fed will move to a more “holistic” description of labor-market activity.

The new guidance is likely to be “be less specific and more ambiguous and point to a variety of indicators,” said Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles.

It’s not the only item on the Fed’s agenda.

Another focus will be on the Fed’s growth, inflation and interest-rate forecasts.

“The words won’t matter much,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, in an interview. “The market will look at the Fed’s projections.”

The market now expects the fed funds rate to be 0.6% by the end of 2015, implying one rate hike. This is close to the Fed’s own projection, Alexander said.

Economists expect the Fed’s forward guidance to be tested once the weather impact clears. Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee late last month that it is “difficult to discern exactly how much” bad weather was obscuring the economic outlook.

If the economy snaps back in the second quarter, market participants will likely pull forward the anticipated date of the first policy tightening into earlier in 2015, Alexander said.

“There is no doubt the market will test the Fed,” said Robin.

Payden & Rygel’s Cleveland said that if markets started to price in an earlier tightening, the Fed might be forced to be more specific with its guidance. The timing of the first rate hike in mid-2015 appears to be the “line in the sand,” he said. So, for the time being, he said, the Fed “can use words.”

As for the Fed’s bond-purchase program, it’s barely in the spotlight after dominating the agenda for so much of last year.

Despite generally weak data since its last meeting in January, the central bank is widely expected to continue to reduce the pace of its monthly asset purchases by a further $10 billion, to a rate of $55 billion a month.

“Tapering is clearly on tap,” said Alexander.

This would be the third straight Fed policy meeting with a gradual reduction in the pace of purchases. Analysts expect the slow reduction to continue until the program is fully wound down, at the end of the third quarter. Only a shock to the economy would cause the Fed to change course, analysts said.

But it is still possible for traders to change the value of a currency in order to make a profit.

As it is a 24-hour market, it is not easy to see how much the market is worth on a given day.

Institutions find it useful to take a snapshot of how much is being bought and sold. Until February, this happened every day in the 30 seconds before and after 16:00 in London and the result is known as the 4pm fix, or just the fix.

Since these violations came to light, the window has been changed to five minutes to make it harder to manipulate.

The fix is very important, as it is the peg on which many other financial markets depend.

So how do you make currency prices change in the way you want?

Traders can affect market prices by submitting a rush of orders during the window when the fix is set.

This can skew the market's impression of supply and demand, so changing the price.

This might be where traders obtain confidential information about something that is about to happen and could change prices. For example, some traders shared internal information about their clients' orders and trading positions.

The traders could then place their own orders or sales in order to profit from the subsequent movement in prices.

This can relate to the 4pm fix, with a trader placing a trade before 4pm because he knows something will happen at around 4pm.

It is easier to move prices if several market participants work together.

By agreeing to place orders at a certain time or sharing confidential information, it is possible to move prices more sharply.

That could result in traders making more profits.

Collusion can be "active", with traders speaking to each other on the phone or on internet chatrooms. It can also be "implicit", where traders don't need to speak to each other but are still aware of what other people in the market are planning to do.

'Hooray nice teamwork'

Last November, the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) gave some examples of how traders at banks calling themselves names such as "the players", "the 3 musketeers", "1 team, 1 dream" and "the A-team" attempted to manipulate foreign exchange markets.

In one example, it said traders at HSBC had colluded with traders from at least three other firms to attempt to drive the fix for the sterling-dollar rate lower.

It said traders had shared confidential information about client orders prior to the fix, and then used this information to attempt to manipulate the fix downwards.

The sterling/dollar exchange rate fix fell from £1.6044 to £1.6009 in this particular example, making HSBC a $162,000 profit.

Afterwards, traders congratulated themselves, saying: "Loved that mate... worked lovely... pity we couldn't get it below the 00", "there you go.. go early, move it, hold it, push it", "nice works gents..I don my hat" and "Hooray nice teamwork".

In another example, the FCA said Citi traders had attempted to drive the euro/dollar fix upwards by sharing information on its buy orders with traders at other firms.

Traders at these firms then transferred their buy orders to Citi, giving it more influence on the market

Ultimately, the euro/dollar fix rose and Citi's profit for the trade reached $99,000.

The price movements arising from the manipulation are so small that holidaymakers are unlikely to notice a big difference when buying foreign currency.

The biggest losers are companies found guilty of manipulation. Even for big banks £2bn is a lot of money.

The regulators say that some of the banks' clients could have suffered from the market being skewed. That could affect the value of pension funds and investments.

This kind of manipulation also further undermines trust in the financial system, which has been through a series of scandals.##78|Empty##79|Graphics and more below.

NEW YORK — Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which raises the question — how often do people tip their baristas?

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company’s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don’t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn’t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there’s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke said. At the drive-thru location where she works, for instance, she said tips go down when it’s cold out and people are less likely to reach out and put money in the tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview. There are no plans to bring the mobile tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn’t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they’ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.

Adding to concerns, China reported an unexpected trade deficit, which has triggered global growth concerns. Stocks may go about a consolidation move, with some degree of profit taking most likely to occur.

U.S. stocks extended their advance in the week ended March 7th, as the braved the fears generated by the developments in Ukraine and the uncertainty triggered by mixed economic data.

Last Monday, the major averages were hit by geopolitical concerns and closed notably lower. However, with Russia softening their stance, geopolitical worries faded, triggering a substantial rebound by the markets on Tuesday. Amid the release of soft economic data on private payrolls and the non-manufacturing sector, the averages went about in a lackluster manner on Wednesday before closing mixed.

Notwithstanding the release of positive jobless claims data, the major averages closed mixed again on Thursday. The major averages closed mixed once again on Friday, as the simmering Ukrainian crisis and uneasiness over the overbought levels of the markets took the sheen out of the positive non-farm payrolls data.

For the week, the Dow Industrials rose 0.80 percent and the S&P 500 Index climbed 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.65 percent.

Among the sector indexes, the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the KBW Bank Index advanced over 3 percent for the week, and the NYSE Arca Airline Index and the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index rose over 2 percent each. Additionally, the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index added close to 2 percent each, while the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index slipped 1.31 percent.

Commodity, Currency Markets

Crude oil futures are sliding $1.46 to $101.12 a barrel after ending almost flat at $102.58 in the week ended March 7th.

Last Monday, crude oil rallied by over $2-a-barrel amid geopolitical concerns. However, the commodity retreated by over $1.50-a-barrel on Tuesday after Russia pulled its troops back from the border.

The commodity fell further, dropping close to $2-a-barrel on Wednesday amid the release of weak private payrolls data. Oil edged up modestly on Thursday. The commodity jumped by over $1-a-barrel on Friday in reaction to the non-farm payrolls report.

Gold futures, which rose $16.60 or 1.26 percent to $1,338.20 an ounce last week, are moving down $1 to $1,337.20 an ounce.

On the currency front, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro in the week ended March 7th, losing 0.53 percent before ending the week at $1.3875. At the same time, the greenback rose 1.45 percent against the Japanese yen to 103.28 yen.

The U.S. dollar is currently trading at 103.35 yen and is valued at $1.3883 versus the euro.

Asia

The Asian markets retreated amid profit taking, as the recent run up and soft Chinese trade data generated negative sentiment. The Chinese market plunged close to 3 percent, and the Japanese and Hong Kong markets also retreated sharply.

Japan's Nikkei 225 average opened lower and declined steadily till the afternoon. Thereafter, the index moved sideways before closing down 153.93 points or 1.01 percent at 15,120. Export stocks moved to the downside, while construction, real estate, pharma and banking stocks found buying interest.

Australia's All Ordinaries languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing down 46.20 points or 0.84 percent at 5,431. Material stocks with exposure to the Chinese slumped, while energy and financial stocks also came under selling pressure.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 22,265, down 395.56 points or 1.75 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index plunged 58.84 points or 2.86 percent to 1,999, closing below 2,000 for the first time since January 20th.

On the economic front, a report released by Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that Chinese exports declined 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports. Consequently, the trade balance turned to a deficit of $22.98 billion from a surplus of $31.86 billion last year. Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.

Separate data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual consumer price inflation in Chine eased to 2 percent in February from 2.5 percent in January, with the drop coming in line with estimates.

Final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that Japan's fourth quarter GDP growth was downwardly revised to 0.2 percent quarter-over-quarter from the 0.3 percent increase estimated earlier. The downward revision was in line with estimates.

Overall bank lending in Japan was up 2.4 percent year-over-year in February, according to data released by the Bank of Japan. This was down from 2.5 percent in January.

Europe

After a weak start, European stocks recovered in early trading but have turned mixed since then

In corporate news, Bouygues agreed to sell part of its mobile phone network and a portfolio of frequencies to smaller peer Ilaid SA in a deal valued at up to 1.8 billion euros or $2.5 billion. Unilever bought a majority stake in Chinese water purification company Qinyuan Group for an undisclosed amount.

Sentix released the results of its investor sentiment survey, which showed that confidence among investors in the eurozone remained almost unchanged in March. The corresponding index came in at 13.9 compared to 15 in February.

U.S. Economic Reports

The unfolding week's economic calendar is backend loaded, with some first-tier economic data due only in the latter part of the week. The spotlight is likely to be on the Commerce Department's retail sales report for February, the weekly jobless claims report and preliminary results of the consumer sentiment survey by Reuters and the University of Michigan.

The Commerce Department's wholesale and inventories reports for January, the Treasury Budget for February, the Labor Department's import and export prices data for February, the producer price inflation report for February and Treasury auctions of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds round up the economic events of the week.

There’s been talk of imposing economic sanctions against Russia, providing Ukraine with financial help, and even going after the foreign assets of Russian officials.

More recently, many Republicans have argued that one way to blunt Russia’s strength in the region, if not also Europe, would be to use gas—not the kind used in warfare, but the kind that supplies heat.

Natural gas is a major export of Russia’s, which was the world’s No. 1 producer of this natural resource until recently. It provides Ukraine with 60% of its natural gas supplies, and in a country where the winters are freezing, the importance of this trade relationship cannot be understated.

The Kremlin has been happy to use its natural gas exports to Ukraine as leverage whenever the former Soviet republic has gotten out of line in the eyes of Russian officials. Russia has even threatened to cut off this supply altogether during previous troubles between the two countries.

Russia also sells a lot of natural gas to Europe. In fact, its biggest customer is Germany, which buys more Russian natural gas than any other nation. Other European powers also purchase substantial amounts of the resource, including Italy, France and the United Kingdom.

This fact helps to explain why most European leaders have been muted in their discussion of the Ukrainian crisis. British Prime Minister David Cameron publicly stated that his government would not back the U.S. in imposing trade sanctions against Russia, possibly out of concern for how such a move would impact his country’s natural resource needs.

Nevertheless, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been hotly pushing the natural gas debate, arguing it is time for the U.S. to flex its own export muscles.

Thanks to the development of hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking), the U.S. these days is producing more natural gas than ever before—and has eclipsed Russia as the top producer globally.

This abundance has American companies wanting to sell their surpluses overseas. But because the U.S. has never before exported this resource, special plants and facilities need to be constructed at ports along the Gulf of Mexico, which require licenses from the federal government.

That’s why House Speaker John Boehner has been calling on the Obama administration to expedite the approval of said licenses. Doing so would put the U.S. in a position to start selling natural gas to Ukraine and Europe and cut into Russia’s power position vis-à-vis this vital trade, according to Boehner and other GOP lawmakers.

House Republicans aren’t the only ones talking gas in Washington. The Obama administration also has jumped on the bandwagon, according to Coral Davenport and Steven Erlanger of The New York Times, who wrote: “The crisis in Crimea is heralding the rise of a new era of American energy diplomacy, as the Obama administration tries to deploy the vast new supply of natural gas in the United States as a weapon to undercut the influence of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ukraine and Europe.”

However, neither Republicans nor the administration have said exactly how this export strategy would work. And that’s because it can’t.

It’s not like the U.S. has a trans-Atlantic pipeline ready to go for shipping natural gas to the other side of the world.

Or as Max Ehrenfreund noted at The Washington Post’s Wonkblog: The “gas would presumably get to Europe via the White House’s secret magical natural-gas teleportation machine, which can transport billions of cubic feet per day across the Atlantic using nothing but fairy dust and smiles.”

There is a way to sell and ship natural gas from U.S. drilling fields to other nations. But the process is expensive, complex and time-consuming—and in no way can it be done in a matter of weeks or even months to help Ukrainians.

Here’s why:

To export natural gas, companies first have to convert it into a liquid to facilitate transporting it. Once it becomes Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), it can be loaded onto special tankers and shipped across the Atlantic (or the Pacific, more on this in a moment).

But once it gets delivered to some far-flung port, LNG has to be reconverted into a gas to make it usable. That means the country receiving American LNG exports has to have a regasification plant.

Ukraine currently has zero regasification terminals (there’s talk of building one in the port city of Yuzhny, near Odessa, but it’s just talk).

So even if the U.S. had ships loaded with LNG ready to depart, which it doesn’t, there wouldn’t be any point in sending it to Ukraine because it couldn’t do anything with it.

So why is Boehner, not to mention Exxon Mobil, bringing up LNG export licenses in the Ukraine debate? Because there’s money to be made in Asia, where demand for LNG is very high.

Currently, five of the six largest importers of LNG are in Asia. They are (in order): Japan, South Korea, China, India and Taiwan.

Japan has been especially hungry for LNG since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated its nuclear power industry, forcing it to rely more on natural gas imports.

Asia’s demand for LNG is the real reason why Washington wants to ramp up U.S. exports, leaving Ukraine still at the mercy of Russia’s natural gas powerhouse, Gazprom.

China and the European Union (EU) can work out a solution to their trade disputes through mutual respect and proper consultations, said Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Thursday.Being each other's biggest trading partners, it is natural that the two come across some trade frictions, said Li at a press conference held after the annual parliamentary session ended."As long as the two sides respect each other and engage in proper consultations, problems can be solved," Li said, citing last year's trade dispute case of photovoltaic products as a successful example.Trade disputes are individual cases and account for a small percentage in the two-way trade, he added.Both China and EU are strong advocators of multipolar world and greater investment facilitation, so it is an irresistible trend that companies from the two sides enter each other's market and invest mutually, he said.Li expected that China and EU can carry on the negotiation of an investment treaty in a fair, reciprocal and facilitating way, so that there will be greater mutual investment and deeper economic integration between the two sides.Speaking of the export to EU, Li promoted China's equipment industry at the press conference, saying that Chinese companies can deliver the equipment for building high-speed railways and nuclear plants in the fastest way and at the minimum cost.China is upgrading its economy, including the export, he said."We can't just export toys, apparel and shoes," he said.The export of Chinese equipment is mutually beneficial for all partners, he said, adding that Chinese producers can test and improve their products through international competition while many Chinese equipment have components outsourced globally and use technologies bought abroad.##95|Empty##96|Maryville, TN (37804)

Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's shareholders want their money back, said Gretchen Morgenson at The New York Times. Few investors would "buy stock in a company that barred you from sharing in its future earnings." After all, "participating in the upside is what stock ownership is all about." But shareholders in the two government-sponsored mortgage enterprises can't do so, thanks to a 2012 government restriction that bars investors from receiving Fannie's and Freddie's profits. Back then, stockholders "had little hope of making much money." But now Fannie and Freddie are booming, and instead of sharing the wealth, the government is "siphoning off the entities' profits." The hedge fund Perry Capital is leading investors in a federal lawsuit challenging the government's rule, claiming it amounts to a "backdoor nationalization of the companies" without providing any compensation for shareholders.

Fannie's and Freddie's stock prices rose by 950 percent last year, said Patrick Morris at The Motley Fool. Yet these companies "operate with a total disregard for common shareholders by returning all profits to the U.S. Treasury." And regardless of the court case, there's no reason to think that will change soon. Legislators on both sides of the aisle, along with President Obama and Freddie and Fannie officials, have made it clear that they're focused on benefiting taxpayers, not shareholders. Shareholders had better realize that for these housing giants, "the days of wild speculation and surging stock prices are over."

This arrangement is "truly outrageous," said David Skeel at The Wall Street Journal. The government "insists it was looking after taxpayers' interests" by swooping in to collect the profits, "but it hasn't explained why it cut private shareholders off when it began to look like they too might benefit." The government should roll back the 2012 rule on its own, but "more likely, the issue will be decided in the courts." If the plaintiffs win, at least "Fannie's and Freddie's shareholders will fare better than other investors (such as Chrysler's senior lenders) who have been blindsided by the government's growing penchant for picking winners and losers." In the end, though, courts can only do so much to "repair the rule of law. A far better approach would be for the government to honor it in the first place."

Hold on, said Paul McMorrow at The Boston Globe. Let's not forget that the greed of private investors is what led to the collapses of Fannie and Freddie — and thus to "the costliest bailout of the financial crisis." The two companies' "subprime bond binge had nothing to do with helping Americans buy homes and everything to do with chasing profits for private shareholders." And now we have Wall Street "trying to sink its hooks back into the mortgage companies." It's too bad Congress didn't have the nerve to solve this problem once and for all "by putting the companies down for good." As matters now stand, "if the current Wall Street gambit succeeds, it could re-establish the same dynamic that helped ruin the companies in the first place."##100|Urban Outfitters, Inc., a lifestyle products and services company, engages in the retail and wholesale of general consumer products.

Hertz investors were seeing plenty of green this St. Patrick's Day.

Late Friday, the Financial Times reported that Hertz Global Holdings (ticker: HTZ) planned to spin off its construction equipment rental business ( HERC ), according to anonymous sources close to the company. The FT reported that the auto-rental giant was expected to make the announcement official this week.

The move has been on the table for some time, as Hertz said it was exploring potential changes to its structure in December. The FT's sources put a $4.5 billion price tag on the division.

Hertz shares jumped 5.3% to $27.35 in recent trading but should drive higher.

The news offsets the disappointment surrounding United Rentals ' (URI) acquisition last week of National Pump, which was seen as a potential bidder for HERC. Moreover, MKM Partners analyst Christopher Agnew predicts that the spinoff could "pre-empt recent presumed activist activity" by noisy investors like Carl Icahn, who have been clamoring for greater shareholder returns, while also acting as a catalyst for the stock. (See Hot Research, "Hertz Spinoff Could Head Off Activists," Jan. 10.)

With Hertz reporting fourth-quarter results tomorrow, MKM's Agnew suggests that investors take "advantage of any weakness on or around the quarter." He notes that "the outlook for 2014 remains very attractive, in our view, based on industry fundamentals (consolidation/pricing and volumes) and potentially improves on any disappointment as we believe Hertz's need to drive pricing will increase."

Moreover, according to the Manheim Index, released earlier this month, pricing and mileage trends for rental cars are trending positively. "Hertz continues to increase its use of alternative disposition channels which should provide ongoing structural cost savings," notes Wells Fargo analyst Richard Kwas, who reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock.

With growing demand bumping up against disciplined fleet levels, the balance of power has shifted in rental car companies' favor. This could continue to be the case this year, boosting free cash flow and earnings.

Barrons.com has been bullish on Hertz before, writing late last year that the market was overreacting to the firm's disappointing earnings preannouncement (see Weekday Trader, "Take Hertz for a Spin," Oct. 3, 2013). The shares are up nearly 25% since that call, compared to a single-digit gain for the S&P 500.

At just over 13 times forward earnings, the stock isn't as cheap as it was last autumn. Yet the company has been delivering robust annual double-digit earnings-per-share growth since 2009, a trend projected to continue through 2016.

In addition, the rally put the stock closer to the valuation of main rival Avis Budget Group (CAR), which has long traded above Hertz, given the lower profitability of construction equipment rentals. The spinoff should allow Hertz to enjoy a plumper valuation. And analysts still expect the stock to climb almost 15%, even after Monday's pop.

In short, Hertz should continue to speed ahead in 2014.

Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, as markets bounced back from a punishing session on Monday, while Japanese stocks gave up most of their early gains after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy.



Japan’s Nikkei 225 index regained 103.97 points, or 0.7%, to 15,224.11, after the country’s central bank made its policy announcement.



The U.S. dollar also gave up some ground against the yen, with the greenback last at ¥103.27, compared with the day’s high of ¥103.43, and steady with its level in New York late on Monday.



The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong eked up 4.68 points to 22,269.61



Although there are low expectations for a policy change, investors had been looking for signs on whether the Japanese central bank is preparing to expand its stimulus measures later in the year in light of the coming increase in the sales tax.



More broadly, the region was making a mild recovery after weaker-than-expected export data from China led to a selloff across the board, with the benchmark index in Shanghai falling the most since June. The heavy selling on Monday in Asia didn’t turn into a global rout, with Wall Street recording only mild losses overnight, giving markets some space to recover.



Some large Chinese banks edged higher in Hong Kong, as data showed that China’s total credit growth slowed sharply in February. The weaker credit growth came after regulators warned that too much growth could threaten the health of the financial system. China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China both added 0.6%.



Trading in Sydney was recovering from weakness earlier in the session brought about by news that Australian business conditions had fallen sharply in February.



The National Australia Bank’s survey said that business conditions, which includes inputs such as labour and purchasing costs, as well as trading conditions, fell to zero in February from a plus-five score in January.



Miners remained in focus in Sydney, after a sharp fall in the price of iron, which shot 8.3% lower on Monday to its lowest level since October 2012.



The large miners, however, gained after sharp losses in the previous session: Rio Tinto added 1% and BHP Billiton was 0.2% higher, after losing 5.8% and 4.1%, respectively, on Monday.



In other markets;



The Shanghai CSI 300 Index recovered 10.87 points, or 0.5%, to 2,108.66



In Taiwan, the Taiex perked 37.09 points, or 0.4%, to 8,702.33



Singapore’s Straits Times Index picked up 2.77 points, or 0.1%, to 3,129.40



Korea’s Kospi Index nicked up 9.45 points, or 0.5%, to 1,963.87



The New Zealand Exchange 50 index slid 15.90 points, or 0.3%, to 5,101.94



In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 crept up 2.32 points to 5,413.84.

Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in four and a half months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal’s safe-haven appeal.

Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at $1,355 an ounce, traders said.

Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing over one per cent.

“There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals,” said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.

“It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well,” he said.

“With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold’s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets.”

Spot gold had gained 0.6 percent to $1,357.11 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after earlier hitting $1,359.25 – its highest since Oct. 29. The metal gained 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.

Bullion has gained 13 per cent this year following a 28 per cent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.

Ukraine’s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise

rule from Moscow within days.

China’s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

PHYSICAL MARKETS

Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices.

In China, the world’s biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20.

Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce.##110|Empty##111|Hampshire tropical fruit importer Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world's largest banana company.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of 4.6 billion US dollars (£2.75 billion) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which imports banas through Portsmouth, also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of 3 billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) and 20,000 staff.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including in Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at 526 million US dollars (£314.5 million).

The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: ''Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

''We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.''

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world's oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.##112|ES News Email Enter your email address Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email cannot be used.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney today admitted he had no direct control over soaring house prices in prime central London.

He told MPs that the Bank did not have the “tools” to dampen the market in the capital’s affluent central boroughs, which was driven by cash buyers, many of them from abroad.

He told of concerns that spiralling property prices could encourage people in other parts of London and Britain to take out mortgages that they would be unable to afford once interest rates start rising from their historic low of 0.5 per cent.

Appearing before the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Carney said: “There are two property markets in London, one which is driven by cash buyers, a large proportion of which are foreign, and a more conventional property market which is mortgage-based for residents. In terms of the former, we do not have tools that directly would affect that.”

Pressed by Teresa Pearce, Labour MP for Erith and Thamesmead, on whether the Bank was concerned that fast-rising prices in London could spread to the rest of the country, he said: “We have to be alive to that possibility.”

He highlighted the worry that banks’ and building societies’ lending standards will “deteriorate” as the economy recovers, with this being “fed” by house price hikes.

“Our concern would also be that a rising housing market, occasioned in part because of the dynamics in prime central london, would encourage individuals to take greater risk without fully incorporating entire interest rate cycles that would transpire over the life of a mortgage,” he added. He warned of the dangers of a “ temporary self-fulfilling prophecy” of house prices just continuing to rise which could lead to many households taking on too much debt and leaving them in “vulnerable” positions for many years.

New figures show some London property hotspots, such as Fulham and Clapham, experience double-digit price increases last year, with prime central London seeing a 7.9 per cent increase.

On interest rates, Mr Carney said it was not “unreasonable” to say that interest rates could rise to 2.5 per cent over the next three years.

Millions of homeowners could be hit by a “premature rise in interest rates” because of a skewed housing market, Ed Balls warned today.

Writing in today’s Evening Standard, the shadow chancellor accused the Coalition of putting low rates at risk. “The danger is that the Bank of England Governor may be forced to act to rein in the housing market and we’ll see rising interest rates for all,” he writes.##113|Empty##114|Consequently, I've read half a dozen more articles on doom-and-gloom and while most were riddled with mistakes, recent pieces from 'Grant's Interest Rate Observer' laid out a more honest rationale for angst, in addition to common sense that one of the longest bull markets in history is due for a pullback or correction. Of course, the focus has been on the "crash," which has to be monstrous for those experts that spooked folks out of stocks in March 2009, and into gold and bomb shelters.

The term "not going to end well" comes to mind, although it quantifies nothing, thus any major drop would suffice.

For them and many in the media, missing 10,000 points then seeing a 3,000-point correction would equal a 3,000-point correction; they would be right and will cheer their prescient predictions, so spot on that they began making them four years ago.

Before touching on Mr. Grant, whom I have always admired though I have always felt he was a curmudgeon, reading and hearing all the noise is akin to listening ad nauseam to those Budweiser Frogs in those old Super Bowl commercials. However, Grant is a super smart guy, so I read and took notes. The first thing everyone should understand is that the Fed is NOT buying $65.0 billion in stocks each month through its (QE) quantitative easing program. Those funds in fact are going to the federal government via direct purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage backed securities. In fact, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae must guarantee the only MBS the fed can purchase.

Fannie Mae Is Making a Mint?

Have you heard...Fannie Mae paid back more in dividends to Treasury than it took in as bailout money, and while this was happening, the shares of Fannie Mae were up 1,700% this past year? Officially, management points to increases in housing prices, lower defaults, and greater mortgage demand. I have to wonder if selling certain assets to the Fed has helped this most amazing turn of events. With a $7.2 billion payment this month, Fannie Mae would have paid the government $121.1 billion against $116.1 billion in bailout funds.

It really helps when you have the market to yourself, and can sell your junk to what has become a Yucca mountain known as the Fed balance sheet. (Interesting, that's what government sponsored entities once were for the banking industry, facilitating the practice of bundling good stuff and crappy stuff, and spreading these around the world until large chucks landed in their vaults.) Right now, all profits from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac go to the federal government, which has no plans to end its control of these two cash cows.

It makes one wonder just how much risk the federal government is taking by kicking the private sector out of the student loan program if things get shaky, and how they can offload them to the Fed's balance sheet. To coin a phrase..."it can't end well"...or can it? Can the Fed sit on this junk until it becomes better, or simply catches a bid? Fannie Mae has had eight consecutive quarters of profits, all that cash has gone into the coffers of an administration that has an insatiable need to spend. Fannie Mae says it has facilitated $4.1 trillion in mortgage lending since 2009, which matches up evenly with the $4.1 trillion on the Fed's balance sheet.

We have seen a string of job cut announcements by banks paring down their mortgage lending departments. Many suggest this presages a collapse in the housing market, or a realization that demand will never materialize. I wonder if the fact Fannie Mae commanded 77% of single-family mortgages from 2009 to 2013, from a pre-crisis average of just 23% have anything to do with banks tossing in the towel.

Members of Congress have quoted that these agencies should pay back the federal government 50 to 1, not an even one-to-one because of the risk. I know there is risk in the equation, but more and more it seems this opaque entity with little oversight known as the Federal Reserve has assumed it all. In the meantime, I am still not able to connect the dots from QE to the stock market.

Grant's Observation

Grant's letter points to ultra-low rates and QE, worrisome valuations, including cash flow and punk top- line growth. He observes that the Fed should not worry about deflation, although weak top-line revenue growth says to me that a lack of pricing power hints at deflationary pressure. Moreover, price to revenue has never been a key stock market valuation. I think he is right about the fact that capital has replaced labor, which poses a catch-22 for the Fed's mission of job creation.

I read one pugnacious report stating all the mergers in 2013, were companies using artificially-pumped-up share prices to make acquisitions. Of course, using inflated stock is a smart thing to do if management agrees its shares are indeed overvalued. I actually bothered to look at the top acquisitions last year, and most involved all cash or some cash including the largest deals.

Then there is the beef over companies buying back their own shares. It's true that last year was huge for buybacks, but Grant points out in a different article; companies are buying back their shares at record highs, missing the "pump" period, but being okay with being the "dump" part. One would think that this is not their first rodeo to make such rookie mistakes.

If suckers are buying stocks, then that means corporate America is the biggest sucker having purchased $124 billion of its own shares in the third quarter of 2013 alone.

An aside: I really dislike big-time, corporate stock buyback programs exiting side by side with major insider selling, but that's a topic for another day.

My Worries

I think QE is different from zero percent interest rates, so I have not feared the taper as much as those that have missed the rally. There is no doubt that low rates help stocks in many ways.

The buybacks lower share-increasing earnings, (while big-time buying is still coming through.)

Low rates discourage savings, and encourage investing and spending. Cheap money actively seeks a home, even though Main Street is not getting much of that cash yet. The stock market is "due" to correct. Valuations are much higher, although they were absurdly low in March 2009. I am worried about deflation.

What I like is that valuations are nowhere near hysteria, other than in the biotech sector and for a handful of tech names. I am focusing on individual names and opportunities, like the global growth story (year to year not quarter to quarter), and still think investors should be focused on the next 200% move, not the next 20% correction.

Jim Grant is not a doom-and-gloom guy looking to sell books. He is very rigid and uses metrics, which I think do more to keep people out of bull markets. In fact, Jim points out that in January 1991, his letter headline read:

"Market off its Rocker"

He does not think this market is off its rocker, but overvalued and vulnerable.

Corrections are part of investing and inevitable. Predicting them is like predicting snow in the winter. I've been through three crashes as an investment professional, there have been tons since the crash of 1929, and when it's all said and done the market came roaring back, finding its way to new highs. I do not live for a crash.

That does not mean we do not take steps to mitigate risk, mostly by adjusting our cash position (there were several times last year when we were above 20%) and occasionally using additional hedges.

The jobs report was weak enough to leave the usual question marks, but I see the Fed tapering again this month and that would be great news in my book. I know there will be a painful point this year, maybe two...but predicating tops and crashes is a tough game. Sure, one day you are right but what do you miss in the meantime? For investors buttoned up in foxholes all these years, they have missed an amazing rally and no crash can fix that...maybe they will become buyers.##115|Empty##116|Empty##117|ONO: ‘Solid 2013’

Beijing doubled the currency’s trading band, which now means the renminbi can move up to 2% on either side of the PBoC’s daily reference rate. This theoretically means that market forces will play a greater role in determining the value of the currency.

Unsurprisingly, the implied volatility of the yuan spiked higher today, rising to an 18-month high as the offshore yuan faltered in early trade. Later in the session, CNY opened around 0.12% lower against the dollar.

However, the overall implications of this move may not be as pronounced as today’s volatility suggests. After all, the PBoC still sets a reference rate every day and that rate doesn’t have to take into account the daily moves of the yuan within its trading band. In other words, when it comes to determining the value of the renminbi, the ability of the currency to move around in its trading band comes a distant second to the PBoC’s morning fixing.

Furthermore, recent events highlight the fact that the PBoC remains firmly in control of the yuan. Over the last month or so the currency has been steadily declining in value, which at first glance may suggest that the market took control of the currency, but the decline was engineered by the PBoC, with the central intervening in the FX market to give the impression that the yuan isn’t a one-way bet – the currency has been on a broad upward trajectory since it was de-pegged from the US dollar in 2005.

Nonetheless, the move to widen the trading band may have short-term implications for the yuan, as evidenced by today’s volatility. This, combined with the PBoC’s desire to show that the yuan isn’t a one-way bet, may drive away speculators that got used to the idea of a forever appreciating yuan, thereby weakening it.

Softness in recent Chinese economic data also doesn’t bode well for the renminbi in the near-term. It raises concerns about growth, thereby encouraging the PBoC to weaken the yuan to support the economy. In saying that, it is likely to be a very gradual weakening as the PBoC attempts to maintain currency stability, hence its may only allow a slow increase in USDCNY’s reference rate.##121|MT.

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals##122|BOSTON (CBS) – They say nothing is certain but death and taxes.

And we can apparently add people’s appetite for pot.

Colorado of course became the first state in the U.S. to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana at the start of this year. And by the looks of things they can’t grow enough.

Dispensaries in the state sold more than $14 million worth of pot in just one month, helping the government pull in about $2 million in tax revenues.

And it’s no wonder. Colorado slaps a 15-percent excise tax on marijuana plus 13-percent in sales taxes.

Add taxes and fees from medical marijuana and the number is more like $3.5 million.

The money goes to programs designed to keep pot away from kids and for school construction.

But we should not expect that kind of return here in Massachusetts where only medicinal marijuana is legal and where we’ll have only a fraction of the dispensaries they have in Colorado.

However, there is an effort to get recreational pot on the ballot this year in Massachusetts.

Groups like NORML and the Marijuana Policy Project, which spent millions to push for recreational pot in Colorado, are already putting money behind a ballot initiative here.

And there have been separate efforts on Beacon Hill.

Law enforcement opposes the idea.

But states need money.

And with numbers like these in Colorado we could see many more states going green.

MORE LOCAL NEWS FROM CBS BOSTON##123|Empty##124|BANGALORE (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not stop sterilizing bond purchases it made at the height of the euro zone’s debt crisis, a majority of euro money market traders polled by Reuters said.

The euro sign landmark is seen at the headquarters (R) of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt September 2, 2013. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach

The ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened.

In order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it “sterilizes” the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds.

Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.

Some economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday’s monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates.

In the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be “relatively limited”.

The poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB’s three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week.

The euro zone’s central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks’ coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints.

Banks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations.

This week’s repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc’s financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would.

Of those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year.

The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.

Eighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.

If sales keep the same pace, revenues will be less than the $70 million projected for the year, the Denver Post reported.

According to the report, the state collected $1.4 million from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana and $416,690 from the state's standard 2.9 percent sales tax.

This means that cannabis shops sold more than $14 million in product during the month of January. Most of those sales came out of the city of Denver.

The first $40 million generated from excise taxes are earmarked for a state school construction fund. So far, $195,318 has gone into that fund, the Los Angeles Times reported.

According to the Denver Post, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January. That number will continue to grow as a total of 167 stores were approved for marijuana sales by the end of February.

Legalized recreational sales in Washington State will launch in June.

##128|Alibaba's Jack Ma shuns Hong Kong in favour of a US IPO as his management team seeks to retain control — AFP pic

HONG KONG, March 17 — Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. kicked off the process for what may be the biggest U.S. initial public offering in two years after struggling to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve its proposed governance structure.

China’s biggest e-commerce company plans to work with Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter. Investment banks value Alibaba, founded by former English teacher Jack Ma, at as much as US$200 billion (RM655 billion), which would make it the second-biggest Internet company behind Google Inc. based on market capitalization.

“The U.S. has obvious advantages in terms of the depth of the pool of capital and sophistication of the investor base,” said Duncan Clark, Beijing-based chairman of BDA China Ltd., which advises technology companies. “In terms of the control issue, Jack and the management, it seems that the Hong Kong stock exchange wasn’t able to accommodate.”

A future listing in China may be considered “should circumstances permit,” the Hangzhou-based company said yesterday in a statement. Alibaba proposed that its partners nominate a majority of the board of directors, a system that isn’t allowed under Hong Kong rules.

The IPO may be the biggest since Facebook Inc. in 2012 and is a blow to Hong Kong, which hasn’t hosted an initial share sale of more than $4 billion since October 2010. Alibaba hasn’t decided when to file for the listing, which U.S. exchange to list on, how much to raise or how large a stake to sell, the person familiar said.





China Listing





“This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency,” Alibaba said in the statement. “Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market.”

The company hasn’t signed official contracts with banks for the IPO, the person said. Representatives of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup declined to comment. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley wasn’t available to comment.

The prospectus for an IPO may be disclosed as soon as April, people familiar with the matter have said. The company is also working with New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, two people familiar with the matter have said.





Facebook, AIA





An Alibaba IPO could raise about US$12.9 billion (RM42.3 billion), Ernst & Young LLP said June 28. That would make it the world’s biggest first-time share offering since Facebook raised US$16 billion in May 2012, and Hong Kong’s largest since AIA Group Ltd.’s $20 billion sale in October 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Alibaba bought back a 20 percent stake from Yahoo! Inc. in 2012 in a deal that valued the Chinese company at $35 billion. The Sunnyvale, California-based Web portal still owns 24 percent of Alibaba while Japan’s SoftBank Corp. owns about 37 percent stake, the companies have said.

SoftBank rose as much as 6.6 percent to ¥8,239 in early Tokyo trading, headed for the biggest jump since August. The Topix index declined 0.4 percent.

“SoftBank’s share price went up because of Alibaba’s IPO story,” said Satoru Kikuchi, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. SoftBank President Masayoshi Son will likely use money gained from an Alibaba IPO to acquire companies in the information technology and Internet fields, he said.





Increased Valuation





Alibaba’s expansion since Ma started the company in his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with two dozen items for sale mirrors China’s emergence as an economic superpower. The company had about 25,000 employees at the end of February and generated about 70 percent of package deliveries in China in 2012. Customers bought ¥35 billion (RM114 billion) of goods on one sales promotion day via Alibaba’s two main platforms last year.

The success has made Ma, 49, one of China’s richest people, with an estimated net worth of US$11.4 billion (RM37 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

There is still room for growth. China has 618 million Internet users, greater than the population of any other country except India, and McKinsey & Co. estimates China’s Internet retail market will triple to US$395 billion from 2011 to 2015.

Alibaba, which operates online markets for products from Louis Vuitton bags to Boston lobsters, posted its fourth straight quarterly profit on surging sales. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was US$792 million (RM2.3 billion) in the three months ended September, a 12 percent increase from the June quarter, according to a January presentation from Yahoo! Inc., which owns a 24 percent stake. Revenue rose 51 percent to US$1.78 billion (RM5.84 billion).

Analyst valuations of Alibaba rose 28 percent after the earnings, with the company worth US$153 billion (RM502 billion), according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News in February. That would make it bigger than 95 percent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

Macquarie Group Ltd. estimated Alibaba could be worth US$200 billion (RM656 billion), while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a Jan. 29 report put the company’s value at about $150 billion (RM492 billion).

Google has a market capitalization of US$394 billion (RM1.3 billion); Amazon US$172 billion (RM564 billion); and Facebook, owner of the world’s largest social network, US$172 billion (RM564 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.





Tencent Holdings





Billionaire Ma Huateng’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., operator of the WeChat instant messaging service, is the biggest Hong Kong- traded Internet success story so far. Shares have soared more than 150 times from the June 2004 IPO price of HK$3.70, giving the company a market value of US$142 billion (RM465 billion).

The IPO of Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook valued the company at US$104 billion (RM341 billion), and the shares lost as much as half their value in the first few months of trading before starting to recover. On Aug. 3, Facebook closed above its US$38 offering price for the first time after mobile-ad sales surged. The stock closed at US$67.72 on Friday.

Alibaba’s US$792 million (RM2.3 billion) profit in the September quarter, the most recently disclosed by Yahoo, compares with the US$422 million (RM1.38 billion) Facebook earned in the same period and Tencent’s net income of US$634 million (RM2.07 billion).





Partnership Structure





Alibaba asked Hong Kong’s exchange to allow a partnership of executives and shareholders to nominate the majority of board members, a person with knowledge of the matter said in August. That would enable Ma, who owns 7.4 percent, and his management team to maintain control.

Hong Kong’s bourse doesn’t allow share classes with different voting rights, as the U.S. does. Such arrangements helped Zuckerberg and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin keep control of their companies after they went public.

Alibaba would “never” change its partnership structure, Reuters cited Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai as saying in an interview on March 12.

“Alibaba’s preference to keep its partnership structure is probably the biggest reason why it chose to list in the U.S.,” said Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. “The U.S. has more investors and analysts in the technology space.”

Under Alibaba’s proposal, all shareholders would still vote on the company’s nominees with partners being able to nominate an alternate board member if shareholders reject a candidate, the person familiar with Alibaba’s thinking said. No other investor rights would be changed, the person said. Deals involving company executives, major expenses and compensation would be voted on by all shareholders, according to the person.





Retail Brands





“This is not a mere profit sharing mechanism, nor is it a vehicle of power to exert greater control over the company,” Ma said in a Sept. 10 e-mail to employees explaining the partnership. The company has 28 partners, Ma said.

After starting as a business-to-business marketplace on Alibaba.com, where companies trade anything from shoelaces to steel, the company has morphed into a more consumer-focused operation. Its most popular platforms include Taobao Marketplace, which links individual buyers and sellers, and Tmall.com, which connects consumers to retail brands.

Affiliate Alipay, an online payment system like EBay Inc.’s PayPal, had more than 800 million registered accounts as of July. Alibaba is expanding into financial services as its finance arm offers funding to companies in China.

Alibaba also is expanding into mobile-phone operating systems and TV set-top boxes to lure more shoppers and sellers.

“Alibaba from day one has been based around making money, and it’s a real Chinese Internet success story,” said Mark Tanner, the founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. “Alibaba is huge now but will just continue to get a lot bigger.” — Bloomberg##129|ESAM OMRAN AL-FETORI | REUTERS ESAM OMRAN AL-FETORI | REUTERS

CAIRO — Did a charismatic Libyan rebel chieftain with big ambitions overreach?

Trying to put a $36 million cargo of crude oil on the black market was an extraordinarily bold move by Ibrahim Jathran, a militia commander whose fighters played a role in the NATO-backed rebellion three years ago against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

In the early hours Monday, Jathran lost his gamble when U.S. Navy SEALs seized control of the tanker Morning Glory, which sailed a week ago from an oil port in eastern Libya. Jathran’s forces had captured the terminal more than six months earlier as part of a broader bid for greater regional independence — and a bigger share of oil revenue.

The U.S. raid, staged at sea about 15 miles south of the Cypriot coast, came at the behest of the governments of Libya and Cyprus, the Pentagon said in a statement. President Barack Obama personally approved the operation.

“No one was hurt tonight when U.S. forces … boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory,” the statement said. The SEAL team, backed by helicopters, launched the overnight raid in international waters from the guided-missile destroyer Roosevelt, U.S. military officials said.

The team of SEALs that boarded the ship was “unopposed” and no shots were fired during the operation, said two military officers briefed on the details. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Three Libyans were taken into custody and will be turned over to Libyan authorities, they said.

“They did not resist,” one of the military officers said of the Libyans, though two AK-47s were found.

The officials refused to say how the SEALs got aboard the tanker or how many commandos were involved, but one said the figure was between 10 and 50.

After securing the tanker, the SEALs were replaced by 25 sailors from the nearby guided-missile destroyer Stout, who are assisting the tanker’s 21-member crew in taking the vessel back to a Libyan port, a voyage expected to take three to four days.

The episode marked the latest chaotic turn of events for Libya, which has been beset by turmoil in the post-Gadhafi era. A weak central government has been struggling to maintain some semblance of control, while armed groups, some of them tribally based, have surged in the power vacuum, some loosely allying themselves with the government and others challenging it.

Jathran’s militia is among the most high-profile in Libya. He set up what was intended to be a de facto government in the country’s oil-rich east. But the rebel blockade of key ports and the seizure of oil installations have reduced crude output to a trickle, causing more hardship in an already-impoverished region as revenue from the capital, Tripoli, also dried up.

Adding to the sense of crisis, a car bomb exploded Monday outside a military academy in the eastern city of Benghazi, killing at least seven newly minted officers and guests after a graduation ceremony. Military installations and personnel have become a prime target around Benghazi, scene of a notorious attack 18 months ago on a U.S. diplomatic compound, in which American Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed.

The North Korean-flagged tanker’s departure from the port of Es Sider came in defiance of ineffectual threats from Libya’s beleaguered prime minister, Ali Zeidan. After repeatedly declaring that he would deploy armed forces to prevent the vessel from setting sail, Zeidan was ousted by lawmakers hours after it left port last week.

His defense minister, Abdullah Thinni, stepped in as his interim replacement. Zeidan, who fled the country, said the parliamentary move against him was invalid.

Libya’s leadership may now face a backlash for seeking U.S. help in dealing with the oil theft. A furor erupted in October when American commandos slipped into Tripoli and seized a senior al-Qaida member known as Abu Anas al-Liby. At the time, the Libyan government publicly demanded an explanation and called the capture a “kidnapping.”

But with Libya’s vast oil reserves virtually its only national asset, and with those riches tied up in a web of international financial obligations, the government had little choice. The official news agency LANA reported the tanker raid simply by citing the Pentagon statement, without any immediate comment from Libyan officials as to what they knew and when.

A few hours before the SEALs operation was announced, Libya’s justice minister made comments that seemed aimed at preparing the public for the news. The minister, Salah Merghani, told journalists in Benghazi that the tanker’s journey was being closely monitored and that the U.S. and the European Union were “clear in their stance” that the rebels’ attempted oil sale went against international law.

The tanker was being returned to Libya, the Pentagon said, presumably to a port under the control of government forces. North Korea said the vessel bore its flag in error and said it had no connection with its owners, thought to be in Egypt or one of the Persian Gulf states.

The UK's first Bitcoin cash machine has been installed in London - allowing people to exchange their digital credits for cash and vice-versa.

Users of the digital-only currency keep their Bitcoins in virtual online wallets and until now used specialist software on their mobile phones or computers to transfer funds to others.

But now Bitcoin has launched its first cash machine in the UK located at the Old Shoreditch Cafe and bar in east London.

And it is no surprise that the location has been chosen due to the cafe accepting Bitcoins as payment since last year.

The bitcoin dispensers will also scan government-issued identification such as a driver's licence or a passport to confirm users' identities.

The custom-designed app is run from essentially a Google Nexus 7 tablet and additional hardware to scan QR codes.

Customers use a mobile wallet app on their phone to display a QR code pointing to their Bitcoin wallet, which the cash machine scans and sends money to.

Paying by Bitcoin is faster for customers than using a traditional debit or credit card.

Transaction fees are also lower than the 2–3 per cent imposed by credit card companies.

The cash machine charges a eight per cent commission but this is hoped to be reduced once the machine, which is currently manually topped up is converted to automated.

Transactions are limited to £1,000 per month for each customer.

What is a Bitcoin ?

Bitcoin is an internet currency that is created using an increasingly complex mathematics formula.

Last week the US Senate described virtual currencies as a “legitimate financial service”.

There are 12 million Bitcoins, worth about $12.9 billion at recent prices.

Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets and is not run by any person or group. Its value depends on people’s confidence in the currency.

Bitcoin is created by a process called mining, in which participants verify and record payments into a public ledger in exchange for transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins.##135|China's yuan weakened against the dollar on Monday after the central bank doubled the trading band for the currency, which the United States has long insisted is undervalued.

The People's Bank of China said Saturday it would allow the yuan to move up or down two percent daily, double the previous one percent, on either side of a mid-point set under the guidance of the bank, which says it polls market makers.

The yuan ended at 6.1780 to the dollar on Monday, the first trading day after the reform, compared with Friday's close of 6.1502, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.

Analysts said the long-awaited financial reform would introduce greater volatility in trading on the national foreign exchange market, but stressed the central bank could still exercise control over the yuan.

Policymakers have pledged to move gradually toward full convertibility of the yuan, also known as the renminbi, allowing it to be freely bought and sold, and bringing with it the uncontrolled movement of funds in and out of China.

The U.S. government said in October that the yuan remained undervalued despite appreciating last year and called on Beijing to disclose more about its market intervention.

But the U.S. Treasury stopped short of officially branding China a "currency manipulator," a designation that could spark sanctions by Washington.

The yuan steadily appreciated against the dollar in 2013, rising more than three percent.

"We view this move as another major step in the direction of allowing the market to play a more important role in exchange rate setting," investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note released Monday.



China keeps a tight grip on its capital account on worries that unpredictable flows of funds could harm the economy and reduce its control over it.

Beijing has widened the trading band previously, most recently moving from 0.5 percent to one percent in 2012. But the latest move comes under the new leadership after a decade-long period when financial reforms largely slowed.

"Increasing the flexibility of the exchange rate has been a long-term objective oft stated by the government. So much so that the market has been somewhat disappointed that this did not occur in 2013," said Wang Tao, head of China economic research for investment bank UBS.

Last month, the yuan suddenly reversed course, at one point closing at an eight-month low, in what dealers believed to be a deliberate move by the central bank to target speculative funds betting on continued rises and prepare for widening of the trading band.

"Now, it is even clearer that the purpose of the depreciation was mostly intended to prepare the market for two-way volatility," Societe Generale Group's China economist Yao Wei said.

Major currencies and even key emerging market units do not usually move more than the four percent maximum intraday change now allowed for the yuan, she added.

Analysts expect the Chinese unit to be slightly weaker to stable this week after the move but some forecast it could still eventually move higher.

"Fundamentals still point to a stronger currency over the medium term," Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams said.

"Greater volatility is likely over the months ahead, but as a result of official intervention, not market forces," he said.##136|The Bank of England’s Governor has warned an independent Scotland would be forced to promise to replace the pound with the euro if it wanted European Union membership.

In a major blow to Alex Salmond’s economic case for separation, Mark Carney told a Westminster inquiry that all new applicants to the EU have to join the single currency in the “fullness of time”.

He also told MPs it is a “distinct possibility” the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move its headquarters south of the Border if there is a ‘yes’ vote in September’s independence referendum.

In triple blow to Alex Salmond’s economic case for independence, the Governor said a separate Scotland’s taxpayers would have to guarantee billions of pounds of deposits held by Scottish banks in England.

Although Mr Carney insisted he was staying neutral in the independence debate, including Mr Salmond’s plan to share the pound, he told MPs he wanted to draw attention to the underlying economic issues.

Opposition politicians praised the Governor’s “reasoned, technical and sobering analysis” and urged the First Minister to “come clean” about a separate Scotland’s currency.

Mr Salmond has insisted a separate Scotland would enter a currency union to share the pound with the remainder of the UK despite the Chancellor ruling out any such arrangement.

His White Paper also claims an independent Scotland would start life in the EU and inherit the UK’s opt-out from the euro.

But Mr Carney highlighted to the Commons Treasury select committee a statement by José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, that Scotland would have to apply from scratch.

“That application, as for any new application to join the European Union, would include a commitment to join the euro in the fullness of time,” the Governor said.

Although new EU entrants do not have to join the single currency from day one, they have to sign up to the euro in principle with a promise to adopt it when they meet the economic conditions.

The select committee also heard how European laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit Scotland.

Asked if RBS would have to move south of the Border if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: "It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it.”

Standard Life and the Alliance Trust, the historic Dundee investment firm, have already started planning to move operations to England if there is a ‘yes’ vote in September.

Questioned whether the Bank of England would help bail out a separate Scotland’s financial institutions, Mr Carney told the committee it can act as lender of last resort to “branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks … but we don’t have to.”

He added the Bank would make a decision after a ‘yes’ vote but warned it was “very cautious” about the “exposure to the public balance sheet.”

John Thurso MP, a Scottish Liberal Democrat member of the committee, said: “When a sensible person says sensible things, SNP ministers would be wise to listen.

“What we heard today was a reasoned, technical and sobering analysis from Mark Carney on the many questions around the SNP’s for currency, EU entry and our financial services.”

Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour’s Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: "It’s time for the SNP to come clean and tell us what their Plan B is on currency and just how many jobs they will sacrifice on the altar of Alex Salmond’s constitutional obsession.”

A Scottish Government spokesman said: “In terms of the euro, Scotland will not be an accession state to the EU but will negotiate the specific terms of our continued membership from within – and in any case, there is no provision to compel any member state to adopt the euro, as the case of Sweden proves.”##137|NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- The gold price was under selling pressure from the HFT boyz almost right from the open in New York on Sunday evening. The low of the day came about 90 minutes before the London open---and by 8 a.m. GMT, gold volume was already well north of 30,000 contracts, which is enormous for that time of day for such a "thinly traded" market.

From the pre-London open low, gold rallied until the London p.m. gold fix, which now comes an hour later than normal in New York because London is not yet on British Summer Time, although it did experience a slight downdraft for a couple of hours starting at the Comex open, which is obvious from a quick glance at the Kitco chart below. Once the "fix" was in, gold got sold down until shortly after 2 p.m. EDT---and then traded flat into the 5:15 p.m. electronic close.

The low/high ticks were recorded by the CME Group at $1,327.50 and $1,344.90 in the April contract.

Gold closed in New York on Monday at $1,339.80 spot, up 30 cents on the day. Volume, net of roll-overs out of the April delivery month, were pretty light at only 99,000 contracts. But as I mentioned further up, almost a third of that occurred in the "thinly traded" Far East market, so it's obvious that the JPMorgan et al were out and about to influence prices during that time period.

The silver chart was almost a carbon copy of the gold chart, except for the fact, that the high of the day came at, or just before, the Comex open---and silver never rallied going into the 11 a.m. EDT London p.m. gold fix, before getting sold off in a similar manner to gold in electronic trading.

The low and high ticks in silver were recorded as $20.61 and $21.06 in the May contract.

Silver finished the Monday trading session at $20.835 spot, down a nickel from Friday's close. Volume, net of March and April, was very chunky at 48,000 contracts.

Both platinum and palladium got sold down before the London open as well. Platinum managed to claw back most of its losses, but palladium recovered little after that. Here are the charts.

I mentioned copper's price smash on Friday in my Saturday column---and the HFT boyz were still pounding away again on Monday---and here's what the 6-month copper chart looks like after Monday's action. I'd guess that major price bottom is in now that JPMorgan et al have the technical funds loaded up on the short side. When the next rally begins, will they let the technical funds off easy, like they're doing in gold and silver right now, or will they really stick it to them? It's all to JPMorgan.

The dollar index closed at 79.71 on Friday afternoon in New York---and weakened a handful of basis points during the Far East trading day on their Monday. But the moment that London opened, a rally developed that was pretty much all done a few hours later---and from there, the dollar chopped sideways into the close in New York. The index finished at 79.75---up 4 basis points from where it started the day. Nothing to see here.

The gold stocks gapped down a bit, hitting their low of the day around 10 a.m. EST. Then they rallied to their high of the day, which was in positive territory, by around 11:30 a.m. EDT. But they couldn't hang on once the "fix" was in, and got sold down as the trading day progressed. A smallish rally into the close cut their loses a bit---and the HUI finished down 0.57%.

The silver equities opened down---and stayed down for the rest of the day, although they did get the same bounce that gold shares got going into the close. But the equities still finished the day worse off than their golden brethren, closing down 1.67%.

The CME Daily Delivery Report wasn't much to look at yesterday, as only 5 gold contracts were posted for delivery within the Comex-approved depositories on Wednesday. However, just a matter of interest, JPMorgan Chase in its in-house [proprietary] trading account stopped 4 of the 5 contracts. The Issuers and Stoppers Report isn't worth linking.

And I note that the number of silver contracts still outstanding in the March delivery month is up to almost 700---but it still remains to be seen how many get delivered. However, from what I'm seeing at the moment, I'd guess most of the long/stoppers will be looking to take delivery. I would also guess that JPMorgan Chase will gobble up most of them.

Much to my surprise, there was another deposit inyesterday. This time an authorized participant added a very respectable 240,929 troy ounces. And as of 9:52 p.m. EDT yesterday evening, there were no reported changes in

The U.S. Mint also had a sales report to start the week. They sold 4,000 troy ounces of gold eagles---1,000 one-ounce 24K gold buffaloes---and a very healthy 736,000 silver eagles. And as Ted Butler has asked on numerous occasions this year---who is the buyer for all these silver eagles, as it certainly isn't the retail trade.

There was only a small amount of gold received at the Comex-approved depositories on Friday, as 4,501 troy ounces were deposited in Scotia Mocatta's warehouse---and nothing was reported received. The link to that activity, if you wish to dignify it with that name, is here

Of course the silver action in these same depositories on Friday was far more substantial, as 867,884 troy ounces were shipped in---and only 29,027 troy ounces were shipped out. The link to that action is here

The stories started off at a reasonable number early yesterday, but it didn't last. Now I have lots---and I turn the final editing job over to you once again.##138|(Adds quotes in paragraphs 3 and 10, background and details)

WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under the law known as Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1, the U.S. administration said on Monday.

With the March 31 enrollment deadline only two weeks away, a top administration official reported a big upswing in public interest in subsidized health insurance and said traffic on the federal website HealthCare.gov reached 1 million visitors over the weekend.

“The last several days have been the busiest since December,” Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a government blog posting that announced the new total.

The 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.

CBO initially forecast 7 million enrollees in private health coverage but scaled back its estimate after technical problems with the rollout that continue to afflict Obamacare insurance marketplaces operated by several states.

Monday’s release did not say how many new enrollees are adults aged 18-34, a younger demographic whose participation is seen as essential for the success of President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement.

Before the rollout, administration officials said their goal was for 38 percent of the new online private insurance marketplaces to consist of younger consumers, who compensate for older, sicker enrollees because they tend to be healthy and cheaper to ensure. But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.

Another important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees in a report this month.

Too few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.

“Five million is only a good number if it’s mostly people who didn’t have insurance before,” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.

But the 2010 law’s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration will not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.

But the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods. And with huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March.

The BoE has the discretion to lend to foreign entities, but it "doesn't have to", Carney told a parliamentary committee today, suggesting the issue would have to be resolved as the situation arose citing parallels to the European Union's ad-hoc response during the euro crisis.

DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations in an announcement on Tuesday on how it will test the balance sheets of the euro zone’s largest banks, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.

The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors deciding whether they need billions of euros of extra capital.

The tests are being done to restore investor confidence and clean up any lingering problems in the euro zone’s banks before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.

The methods some euro zone banks use to decide if a loan has turned sour will fall short of those in the ECB’s review of banks’ loan books, a source with knowledge of the matter said.

The rules will require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said, and will also set the banks estimates of loan losses against ‘challenger models’ created by external auditors.

The ECB declined to comment.##142|By Arjun Kashyap - Data on retail sales and industrial production in China came in below forecast Thursday, MarketWatch reported, citing numbers released by the National Bureau of Statistics, adding to mounting concerns that the world’s second-largest economy might be facing an overall slowdown.

Growth in industrial production in China slowed to 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014, compared to a 9.7 percent expansion in December, and growth in retail sales narrowed to 11.8 percent from 13.1 percent in December, MarketWatch reported. A Wall Street Journal consensus estimate had pegged industrial production to expand at 9.5 percent and retail sales to grow at 13.5 percent.

Analysts at Societe Generale attributed the fall in retail sales to “anti-corruption drive and disinflation” while pinning the slowing of industrial production on rising inventories, according to MarketWatch.

Earlier, Premier Li Keqiang reportedly gave his vote of confidence to the future of the Chinese economy at a press conference to mark the conclusion of the National People’s Congress.

“The Chinese economy has great potential and resilience. We are capable of, and have the conditions to make sure the economy runs within a reasonable range,” he said, according to MarketWatch, before adding: “The situation this year is more complicated.”

The Shanghai Composite index, which had climbed to trade up 1.3 percent following Li’s comments lost some of its gains after the data release and was trading up 0.81 percent in late-afternoon trade. The Hang Seng index, which had rallied to trade up 0.5 percent subsequently fell to trade down 0.4 percent.##143|Empty##144|Empty##145|Americans took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year, the most since 1957, according to a new report from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).

There has been a steady climb in Gold prices over the past several days, blamed mostly on the Ukraine crisis, offsetting the downward movement of the recent, unexpected drop in Chinese exports.



Focussing on Ukraine, analysts everywhere are predicting which way things will go. Russia is still present in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and NATO is monitoring the situation from AWACS jets from nearby Poland and Romania. With the situation still tense, investors have looked to Gold as a safe haven, which may only be a temporary measure. As for the crisis escalating, Russia risks severing essential economic ties to Europe, especially at a time when the Rouble is already suffering, so Russia could stick to the negotiating table instead.



As gold prices are typically flat during March, we may see spot gold more or less plateau at current levels, at the most steady rises without any significant upturns in the market until May.



With regards to long term forecasts, Morgan Stanley has a negative outlook for 2014-15. While mentioning the positives of the Fed’s stimulus, also noted increased regulatory pressure on the financial sector and lowered Gold imports to India, counterbalancing strong demand from China. Goldman Sachs also feels that Gold’s recent performance will eventually turn negative, and as China has said it expects that Gold imports will reduce by about 17%. However, Coutts are remaining bullish, citing rising incomes in China fuelling demand for luxury items such as jewellery. It could be that Chinese demand may act as a safety net against any sudden falls in the long term, and with the economic recovery continuing in the US and Europe, the market may yet be a little more confident overall; investors may steer away from Gold in favour of alternative investments. If the crisis in the Ukraine continues though, investors may continue to seek Gold as a haven investment, going forward, pushing prices up.

About the author##147|The big market story of the day? It was a brutal session in China.

Over the weekend, a bunch of bad economic data came out, including an exceptionally weak export number.

That led to a swift market reaction in China.

The Shanghai Composite, which is already having a fairly rough year, lost 2.86%.

Copper tanked 1.5%. Copper tends to be sensitive to Chinese industrial demand and is having a horrible year.

The Chinese Yuan continues to slide, and is now at its lowest level since late last year.

Meanwhile, the ripples were felt across Asia, with Hong Kong losing 1.7%, Korea down 1%, Japan off 1%, and Australia off 0.9%.##148|Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.

What: After months of continued gains, shares of Fannie Mae (NASDAQOTH:FNMA) fell by an astonishing 40% and Freddie Mac (NASDAQOTH:FMCC) was not far behind dropping 30%, as a result of the announcement of the bi-partisan bill posed by the Senate Banking Committee to begin winding downing the two government sponsored entities. At the time of writing each stock was down approximately 30%.

So What: While the final text of the legislation was not announced, a release from the committee noted Chairman Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) have reached a plan which will ultimately wind down and eliminate Fannie and Freddie while creating the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC), which models the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) used to protect bank deposits.What: After months of continued gains, shares of Fannie Mae (NASDAQOTH:FNMA) fell by an astonishing 40% and Freddie Mac (NASDAQOTH:FMCC) was not far behind dropping 30%, as a result of the announcement of the bi-partisan bill posed by the Senate Banking Committee to begin winding downing the two government sponsored entities. At the time of writing each stock was down approximately 30%.

The reform is aimed to protect taxpayers by ensuring the new entity receives 10% private capital up front, and in turn creates an insurance fund for mortgages. In total it would be funded through fees charged on mortgages, much like the FDIC requires payment from banks for total deposits.

Its aim would be to ensure the mortgage market is stable and liquid, while also safeguarding that a 30-year fixed rate mortgage remains affordable to all Americans. As with much of the discussion from politicians surrounding Fannie and Freddie, the provisions for current shareholders was not mentioned directly.

Mike Crapo noted in the announcement, "This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past."

Now What: Many investors, including billionaires Bill Ackman and Bruce Berkowitz, have campaigned either verbally or through lawsuits that the functions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should ultimately be transferred to privately held enterprises with the same function.

Today's announcement from the Senate Banking Committee instead proposes an insurance fund is created under the belief "the status quo in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship is not a viable option for our nation's housing finance system."

As with any legislation, the proposed bill will have to be passed by lawmakers in both the House and Senate, so it is likely years away from its final approval. However with multiple bi-partisan efforts and the support of President Obama, many believed today's announcement could spell the end of Fannie and Freddie as currently constructed.##149|Empty##150|Empty##151|Empty##152|Empty##153|You are using an older browser version.

General Motors recall faces US investigation

A US congressional committee has said it is investigating General Motors' recall of nearly 1.6 million vehicles over faulty ignition switches.



The problem could turn off the engine in affected vehicles while they were being driven, disabling the airbags.



The carmaker announced the recall last month, but it has admitted employees knew about the defect as early as 2004.

The principle is that all shareholders should have equal voting rights in public companies and each shareholder should have one vote.

Alibaba has planned an IPO with a shareholder structure that allows a group of top managers and founders to nominate and control the board, while holding only around 13 percent of the company's shares. Last October, the NYSE and Nasdaq approved the company's proposal to let its founder and senior management team have control over the make-up of its board.

Francis Lun, CEO of GEO Securities says there are some draw backs with a listing in the U.S., however.

"Companies in in the U.S. face frivolous law suits - the legal risk is much bigger there as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is much tougher," he said.

Lun added that he too doesn't foresee Hong Kong's attractiveness as an IPO venue being dampened.

"I don't see Alibaba's decision to choose New York over Hong Kong as a trend, except for with internet stocks," he said.

Last year, Hong Kong ranked as the second most popular destination for IPOs, after New York. Almost $21.68 billion was raised, compared with $11.46 billion in the previous year, according to Dealogic. By comparison, $44.92 billion was raised in New York last year, compared with $22.47 in 2012.

Alex Wong, director, asset management at Ample Capital said if Alibaba had chosen Hong Kong for its listing, it would have been positive for the city's investment community.

"Hong Kong is largely made up of asset-based companies. We are lacking knowledge-based companies. With Alibaba, it could have changed the way analysts look at and value companies," he said.

Reuters recently polled analysts who put Alibaba's market value at $140 billion.

The new dotcom fever, together with buoyant stock markets, have boosted King's valuation by $2bn in less than a month. At $7.6bn it will be valued more than four times higher than Take-Two Interactive, the company behind Grand Theft Auto. Analysts had valued King at $5.5bn in February, but the company said on Wednesday its shares would be priced at between $21 and $24 each.

The popularity of King's confectionery-themed smartphone and tablet game will make a multimillionaire of its chief executive, Riccardo Zacconi, whose 10.4% stake could be worth as much as $745m, and chairman, Melvyn Morris, who owns a 12.2% interest. Zacconi and Morris, a former director of Derby FC, first worked together at the Midlands-based matchmaking site uDate, which they sold for $150m to Interactive Corporation in 2002.

Between them, the company's 11-strong management team own shares which at the upper end of the range could be worth almost $2.2bn.

Most are selling a small percentage of their holdings, although staff will be free to sell more shares six months after the flotation. No formal date has been set, but leaks suggest King will come to market on 25 March.

The King pricing came as retailers Pets at Home and Poundland also debuted on the stock market. Poundland was priced at the top of its initial range, valuing the company at £750m, but the shares still soared 19%, adding £150m to the value of the business.

Pets at Home performed less well, closing down 4% from its offer level of 245p. At Wednesday night's share price the company was valued at £1.2bn .

The King investment is also one of the most successful ever for the British private equity firm Apax, which in 2005 invested around $63m and now owns more than 48% of the shares, making its holding worth nearly $3.5bn.

King's latest filing with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, reveals that a minimum of 22.2m shares will be sold in the float, raising $530m, of which about $326m will be kept by the company to invest in expanding its operations around the world. The balance will go to stockholders.

It remains to be seen whether the British taxman will benefit from King's success, however, because the company moved its tax registration from Malta to Ireland last year. The role of its British subsidiary, which houses games designers and administrative functions in offices near Tottenham Court Road in London, has been defined as the "provision of management services to other companies" in company accounts.

King makes its games available to download for free and most of its money is raised from purchases made during play. Millions have been persuaded to part with £1 for what are called "paid boosters" including lollipop hammers, coconut wheels and extra lives.

Unlike many internet firms joining the stock market or being snapped up by bigger rivals, King has been profitable for four of the last five years, making nearly $570m after tax in 2013 on revenues of $1.88bn.

New data shows that in February, 144 million people were active daily players of King games, reorganising brightly coloured sweets in Candy Crush, bursting their way through levels in Bubble Witch and sorting fruit in Farm Heroes.

The games, which mostly involve making rows of objects explode by lining up three or more of the same shape or colour, have proved highly addictive with King notching up more than 1.4bn plays a day.

King's valuation, which is based on 315m shares priced at $24, comfortably outstrips that of fellow games company Zynga, which was worth $7bn at its 2012 stock market flotation but has seen its fortunes go into reverse.

Its opening price will mean the company is worth about half Twitter's initial valuation, but many times the previous UK record set by the demerger of internet service provider Thus from Scottish Power in 1999. The company was then valued at £2.2bn ($3.7bn at today's exchange rate), while Lastminute.com, which became a poster child for the dotcom crash, floated at £570m in March 2000.

Two US private equity firms are preparing for big returns from their investments in British retailers. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought Pets at Home four years ago for £995m. After pricing the offer at 245p a share on Wednesday, KKR and other shareholders will pocket £210m gross from the offer, but the buyout group will retain a 46.2% stake after the flotation.

Warburg Pincus, another private equity group, paid £200m for Poundland in 2010. The discount retailer's market debut will raise £375m and a maximum stake of 38%.##173|Empty##174|Empty##175|Close Get email notifications on Tanasia Curtis daily!

* Copper prices fall to lowest since July 2010

* Indexes off: Dow 0.29 pct, S&P 0.32 pct, Nasdaq 0.26 pct

By Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell in afternoon trading on Tuesday after swinging between gains and losses for most of the session as the lack of major corporate earnings or market-affecting data kept trading directionless.

U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in January, as companies built up stocks of autos and machinery, but sales posted their largest decline in nearly five years.

Retailers in the news included American Eagle and Urban Outfitters, their shares down sharply after disappointing outlooks.

“When you get a slow data week, markets tend to get a little jittery and slow,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “The market has been up very quickly and is sort of waiting for a next catalyst.”

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.93 points or 0.29 percent, to 16,371.75, the S&P 500 lost 6.04 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,871.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.349 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,323.099.

Urban Outfitters dropped 5 percent to $35.65 after it reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and said it was “very cautious” on its current quarter. American Eagle Outfitters slumped 6.4 percent to $13.30 after it forecast earnings for the current quarter that were short of expectations.

The S&P retail index slipped 0.4 percent.

Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc advanced 4.6 percent to $56.84 after the company posted fourth-quarter earnings and gave its first-quarter outlook.

Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange hit their lowest level since July 2010 under pressure from rising inventories of the metal and slow demand. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 1 percent, bringing the decline in the past four sessions to 8.4 percent.

Myriad Genetics Inc lost 8.7 percent to $34.46. The diagnostics company said a U.S. court denied a motion that would have stopped rival Ambry Genetics Corp from selling a similar version of Myriad’s cancer test.

Men’s Wearhouse said it would acquire rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers for about $1.8 billion, ending a five-month saga that started with Jos. A. Bank offering to buy its larger menswear rival. Men’s Wearhouse shares rose 5.4 percent to $57.56 and Jos. A. Bank added 4 percent to $64.31.

“M&A activity has been picking up, and it tends to offer a halo effect on sectors and subsectors involved,” said Krosby, pointing to a broad support to the market coming from mergers and acquisitions lately.

J.C. Penney Co Inc jumped 5.8 percent to $8.91 after Citigroup raised the stock to a “buy” and boosted its price target to $11 per share.

Boyd Gaming Corp jumped 16 percent to $13.69 a day after hedge fund Elliott International disclosed a 4.99 percent stake in the gaming company.

La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co surged 66.5 percent to $18.15 after the company said its lead experimental drug to treat chronic kidney disease met the main goal of improving kidney function in a mid-stage study.##177|Denver-based Quiznos has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reduce its debt by more than $400 million. The toasted sandwich chain said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan. Quiznos says the move won't affect its customers.

The company only owns and operates seven of the nearly 2,100 Quiznos restaurants. The rest are owned operated by franchisees and aren't part of the bankruptcy proceedings. It also says its distribution centers are open and fulfilling orders. Quiznos says the restructuring plan has been approved by its creditors so it expects to emerge from restructuring quickly. Quiznos has a location in East Lyme.

-Associated Press##178|Empty##179|Empty##180|LONDON - Banks in the eurozone are now more exposed to government debt than at any time since the financial crisis began, with many increasingly using their balance sheets to prop up ailing governments, deepening the bank-sovereign link that has already pushed a number of countries and lenders into bailouts.

Banks in the region now hold about 1.75 trillion euros in government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to European Central Bank data. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the entire banking system is now on loan to governments.

Although the ECB has said it is keen to break what it terms the sovereign-bank nexus, analysts warn that its hands are tied. European governments need - and many encourage - their banks to finance growing public debt piles because many simply do not have enough alternative buyers after an exodus of foreign investors.

"The sovereign-bank nexus is growing and it is a concern," said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan. "The ECB and regulators want to reduce this risk, but they know they can't right now because the region is only just emerging from a debt crisis. If debt sustainability issues resurface in the future, it will be a problem for heavily exposed banks."

Since the 1980s, global banking regulations have enshrined incentives to hold government debt by making it zero risk-weighted. The Basel Committee chose not to change these zero weightings when the rules were last updated in 2010. Fitch said the latest rulebook even "turbocharges" previous risk weightings.

"The reason that government bonds are zero risk-weighted by regulators is partly political; it is not how we weight them in our credit analysis," said Bridget Gandy, a bank analyst at Fitch, who added that underdeveloped capital markets often necessitate the bank-sovereign nexus.

"Somebody has to buy government bonds, and many countries have traditionally leant on their banking systems to do exactly that. Only once a country's capital markets develop, with a healthy insurance and pension sector, do you increase the pool of buyers, and some countries aren't there yet."

The ECB is blamed by many for having facilitated an increase in exposures, providing banks with cheap loans initially at just 1 percent - falling recently to 0.25 percent - which they can pump into government securities that over the past few years have yielded 7 percent and more - in effect an easy profit.

Cash-strapped peripheral banks - many of which have been shut out of primary markets - have welcomed the opportunity to plug capital shortfalls, ploughing over half of their net borrowings from the ECB's emergency longer-term refinancing operations facility into bonds, while lending a mere 13% to the real economy, according to JP Morgan figures.

The carry trade is estimated to be worth between 5 billion euros and 20 billion euros a year to Spanish and Italian banks, with many firms using the trade not only to hide deep losses, but also as a way to build up capital buffers - in effect using ECB funds to save private shareholders from being diluted.

Banks' holdings of government bonds have risen by 355 billion euros - or about 25 percent - since the liquidity injections in late 2011 and early 2012. Banks in fiscally weak countries have increased their purchases the most, with Italian, Portuguese and Spanish banks increasing their holdings by 62 percent, 52 percent and 45 percent respectively.

"Policymakers say that they need to break this negative feedback loop, but as a side effect, ECB policies have enabled banks to load up on government debt which has furthered the link between banks and their home sovereign," said Stefan Best, a bank analyst at Standard & Poor's.

"The LTRO allowed banks to borrow huge amounts of cash from the central bank at low interest rates and several have used that money to buy government debt to bolster revenues," said Best. "Governments have not objected to them doing this."

It is not the first time that banks have piled into a sovereign-debt-linked carry trade in search of easy money. In the previous decade, many banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank bought billions in Greek debt in order to cash in on the extra yield offered.

That trade spectacularly backfired when Athens was forced to restructure its private debts, leaving those four banks with multi-billion euro losses and the Greek and Cypriot banking systems in need of mass recapitalizations after organizations bailing out the country decided to impose a haircut on Greek debt.

Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of last year was 133 percent, higher than the 129 percent that Greece had in the last full year before it asked for a bailout. Spain also has a debt higher than its annual GDP. According to the IMF, there have been 600 cases of sovereign debt restructuring since the 1950s in 95 countries, often with debt levels lower than Spain and Italy.

Although banks' exposure to government debt is now lower than in the 1990s, when banks in countries including Belgium and Greece devoted more than 20 percent of their balance sheets to sovereign debt, public debt levels across Europe are much higher today, increasing the risk of a debt restructuring.

In Spain and Italy, exposures have increased rapidly in recent years. Spanish banks now hold 297 billion euros of government debt, equivalent to 9.4 percent of total industry assets and up from less than 3 percent in late 2008. Italian banks hold 407 billion euros, roughly 10 percent of total assets and up from 4.6 percent in late 2008.

That growing exposure would increase the risk and cost of mass bank recapitalization in the event of a government debt restructuring.

"The ECB is keen to reduce this dangerous link but it can't escape the fact that many governments still need banks to buy their debt," said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at RBS. "The purpose of banks isn't to finance their national governments, but they are being encouraged to do precisely that." [Reuters]##181|Wondering where your Bitcoins are? Looks like Mt.

Officials said more than 1 million people visited the federal HealthCare.gov website this weekend, and 4 million visited last week, producing hundreds of thousands of new enrollees.

“As this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act,” said Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The administration is racing the deadline, hoping to sign up enough people to make the economics of Obamacare work.

They need to add millions of new customers — and particularly young, healthy Americans — into the system in order to cover the costs of older, sicker Americans who can no longer be denied or limited in their coverage, thanks to the law’s requirements.

Ms. Tavenner didn’t release an updated count of how many younger Americans were among the surge of enrollees, though as of the end of February the rate was well behind what analysts said was necessary.

The government also hasn’t said how many of those who have enrolled have actually paid their premiums — the real measure of how many have coverage — nor have officials said how many of the enrollees were uninsured before, versus those who lost their coverage thanks to other provisions in the law.

Initially, the administration had agreed with analysts who said at least 7 million people needed to enroll in the health exchanges or state-based marketplaces where those without insurance can shop for plans. But after the federal website stumbled in the early weeks, the administration discounted that target.

Still, in the waning days, the sign-up rate is increasing. It took 20 days for the last 1 million to sign up. By contrast, there were fewer than 1 million sign-ups in all of February.

Under Obamacare’s individual mandate, Americans must have health insurance by the end of March or else they will have to pay a penalty in their 2014 taxes.

Last week, however, Republicans said they’d discovered a loophole that will allow anyone who claims a “hardship” to refuse to sign up and still not have to face a penalty. The new hardship exemption was added to the forms in December, but went unnoticed by analysts until last week.

“Frankly, I think the American people deserve some explanation as to what the White House really is doing,” House Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters last week.

But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the 5 million people who have signed up for health plans are all evidence for why the GOP’s efforts to repeal the law are a bad idea.

“Each new enrollee is a reminder of the real, human cost of each of the 51 Republican votes to repeal or undermine this legislation,” she said.

Mr. Obama’s allies are ramping up their efforts to try to boost the number of enrollees, as are administration officials. Mr. Obama has done town halls focusing on Hispanics, while first lady Michelle Obama has encouraged women to sign up and to get their adult children to sign up, too.

China’s exports unexpectedly fell 18% in February, which led to a plunge in commodity prices Monday and worries that the country’s economy is struggling more than expected. But Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the risk of a financial crisis in China remains slim.

“A big concern in the markets in recent months is that defaults in the Chinese bond market could be an early signal of a much bigger financial crisis,” he said. “However, in our view, China’s experience is different than past financial crises in several key respects.”

Mr. Harris points out bond defaults have been “widely anticipated” from struggling companies such as solar-cell maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. and that bonds remain a “modest part of China’s capital markets.”

China experienced its first onshore bond market default last week when Shanghai Chaori missed an interest payment on its bonds.

“A major crisis would require a string of bad outcomes: first the defaults would have to have big contagion effects and second, government efforts to stem the crisis would have to be ineffective,” Mr. Harris said.

The latter part is especially important, because the Chinese government has formidable ammunition to fend off a financial crisis, including the largest foreign reserves in the world.

“The Chinese government has both the resources and the will to forcefully intervene if contagion kicks in,” he said. “They have a relatively modest budget deficit and huge foreign exchange reserves. Inflation is contained so that will not constrain policy. And we would expect the Chinese authorities to act forcefully, and set aside moral hazard concerns, if a systemic crisis emerges.”##185|Bananas have become so popular in America that even a major merger and a minor plague might not impact their prices too much.

Move over Dole. On Monday, Chiquita US:CQB and Irish fruit company Fyffes IE:FQ3 agreed to merge, creating the world’s largest banana company, ChiquitaFyffes. In a $1.07 billion all-stock deal, the combined company would have an estimated $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas.

The merger should help the companies more efficiently supply the planet’s biggest banana republic: namely, the U.S. “The No. 1 fruit Americans eat is bananas,” says Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst with NPD Group. Indeed, while in 1970, Americans ate just about seven pounds of bananas per person (and more than 10 pounds of apples, which were at that time our favorite fruit), by 2010, they were eating more than 10 pounds of bananas per person, and only around 9.5 pounds of apples, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Global consumers love bananas too. According to the United Nations, global banana exports in 2012 climbed more than 7% from 2011 to a record high of 16.5 million tons; the U.S. and Europe accounted for more than half of banana imports.

The Chiquita-Fyffes merger will generate an annual cost savings of $40 million by 2016, according to the companies. And that savings might mean slightly lower prices for consumers, says IBISWorld analyst Antal Neville, who says that ChiquitaFyffes may want to gain market share by offering up the best banana prices for consumers. Currently, bananas cost roughly $0.60 per pound — significantly less on a per-pound basis than apples, oranges, grapefruits, tomatoes and more, according to government data. “Because it’s one of the most consumed fruits, prices really matter,” says Neville. “So the merger could mean cost savings for consumers.”

Indeed, grocers are often reluctant to pass along price increases. According to a United Nations report, wholesale banana prices increased 6.5% in 2012 compared with 2011, while retail prices actually decreased 1.3%. “This apparent contradiction could be explained by the fact that supermarkets spread temporary losses from higher wholesale prices across other products that they sell,” while keeping the prices of bananas low for their customers, the report concludes.

Still, if the deadly banana plague that has hit Asia and parts of Australia hits Latin America and the Caribbean, which produce roughly three-fourths of the world’s bananas, prices could jump, says Neville. The disease, which scientists say is caused by a soil fungus, attacks the popular Cavendish variety of bananas (which makes up about 80% of all banana exports) and rots the banana plants, turning the normally yellowish banana a rancid-smelling brownish color, and rendering the fruit inedible. The disease is especially troubling because it ruins large numbers of bananas (a variant of today’s fungus virtually killed off the Gros Michel banana variety) and recently made the jump from Asia to Mozambique and Jordan.

Experts say that if the banana plague takes a particularly heavy toll, consumers may feel the impact on their wallets — and not just from the price of buying a banana at the grocery store. Neville says that if prices climb high enough, some businesses will choose to raise prices on things like smoothies and muffins that contain bananas. Still, he adds, a much more likely scenario is that — unless prices skyrocket — companies will eat a potential uptick in banana prices. Indeed, businesses know how much we love bananas, and they don’t want to risk alienating consumers by hiking the price unless they have to.##186|The Federal Reserve will probably scrap its 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold and switch to qualitative guidance for signaling when it will consider raising the main interest rate from near zero, according to economists in a survey.

The Federal Open Market Committee, which adopted the jobless threshold more than a year ago, will say on Wednesday that it will instead link policy to a range of economic indicators, according to 76 percent of economists in a March 14-17 Bloomberg News survey. Twenty percent of 54 economists surveyed said the Fed will maintain the threshold, while 6 percent said the Fed will drop such guidance entirely.

Stocks to Drop 90%? These 5 Charts Reveal Why...

Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are considering ways to clarify when they’ll increase borrowing costs for the first time since 2006 after payrolls rose more than projected last month and unemployment fell to 6.7 percent from 7 percent in November. They plan to begin a two-day meeting Tuesday.

Policy makers will lean toward “less specificity and a greater emphasis on just judgment,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Charlotte, North Carolina.

“Often these economic numbers can move in ways you don’t anticipate and because of things you can’t anticipate, and I think they got caught off guard,” he said, citing the fall in joblessness.

Policy makers at their Dec. 17-18 meeting forecast unemployment would decline by the end of this year to 6.3 percent to 6.6 percent. Joblessness has fallen from 7.5 percent in June and a 26-year high of 10 percent in October 2009.

Every Meeting

The FOMC this week also will announce a cut in monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $55 billion and continue reductions at that pace at every meeting before announcing an end to the buying at its Oct. 28-29 gathering, according to the median of responses in the survey. Policy makers at each of their prior two meetings have cut monthly purchases by $10 billion.

The committee “will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings,” Yellen said to the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 27. “That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley in comments on March 6 endorsed a switch to qualitative guidance. In a speech the following day he said the decline in the jobless rate “significantly overstates the degree of improvement in the labor market.” People dropping out of the labor force accounts for much of the fall in the unemployment rate, said Dudley, FOMC vice chairman.

“Dudley seemed pretty clear it’s time to abandon the 6.5 percent unemployment rate, and it makes sense to do it before their backs are up to the wall” should the jobless rate fall further, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. “They’ve laid down enough clues to tell me that they’re ready to make the change.”

Stocks to Drop 90%? These 5 Charts Reveal Why...##187|Empty##188|BEIJING - The Chinese government is set to allow its currency, the renminbi or yuan, to fluctuate more widely against the dollar in the latest sign that the country is loosening its grip on the economy.

China&39;s Central Bank said that beginning on Monday, the daily trading band would double to 2 per cent on either side of a government-regulated parity rate, which could result in wider price fluctuations.

"The widening is within rational range and is a tentative step towards the liberalisation of the yuan&39;s exchange rate," said Yi Xianrong, a senior financial researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The move is widely understood as an attempt to lower the serious risk of a downturn in China. Although its economy is growing at just below 7 per cent, the rate of growth has fallen sharply over the last few years, and there are concerns that banks are masking liabilities.

The government has stepped up plans to liberalize interest rates and to reform the financial system. It said last week that it planned to allow five private banks to lead pilot programmes allowing them to compete with state-run commercial banks.

Despite the moves towards liberalisation, the Chinese government still has the power to set the daily parity rate, allowing it to prevent big swings in the value of the renminbi.##189|Empty##190|Why did this happen?

[Photo: Xinhua] The People's Bank of China has announced that starting March 17, the exchange rate for the yuan will be permitted to fluctuate by 2 percent from a daily midpoint rate that is set each morning by the central bank.



The central bank issued a statement via its website on Saturday that "it will continue to improve the yuan exchange rate system, increase the two-way flexibility of the exchange rate, make the currency more responsive to market forces and keep the exchange rate fundamentally stable within reasonable and balanced levels".



China takes a gradual and steady pace in raising its currency's daily trading limit, from 0.3 percent in 1994 to 0.5 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2012 to the latest 2 percent.



A spokesperson from the bank said the decision is aimed at improving the efficiency of the market in allocating resources, and forms a major part of the country's efforts to optimize its economic development system.



The spokesperson also partially attributed the move to the strengthened risk management capabilities of the country's traders and the rise in trade volume and category in China's foreign exchange market in recent years.



The spokesperson pointed out that the widening trade band is neither related to the yuan's appreciation nor its devaluation, saying two-way flexibility is normal for major international currencies in the middle and long term.



However, he indicated that the central bank may consider "necessary" adjustments or regulatory measures in the event of abnormal fluctuations of the yuan.##192|Polish leader Donald Tusk has said Germany should reduce its gas dependence on Russia for the sake of EU foreign policy.

Speaking to press on Monday (10 March) at a military base in Siemirowice, on Poland’s Baltic Sea coast, he said: “In future, we will not be able to successfully resist against aggressive or expansionist steps by Russia if so many European countries will be dependent on [Russian] gas and will go even further down the road of dependence.”

Tusk (c) visited the military base in Siemirowice ahead of an anniversary of Poland's entry into Nato (Photo: premier.gov.pl)

He singled out Germany ahead of a visit by Chancellor Angela Merkel to Poland on Wednesday.

“German dependence on Russian gas could effectively limit European sovereignty,” Tusk said.

“I will speak about this with Chancellor Merkel above all else, in what way Germany could correct its economic behaviour so that dependence on Russian gas does not paralyse Europe when it needs to act quickly and unambiguously,” he added.

“It’s not just about Germany, but Germany is a good example of this phenomenon [growing dependence] in recent years.”

Tusk spoke after EU leaders last week considered a broad range of sanctions - including on Russian gas and oil - in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula.

Russian state firm Gazprom has also threatened to stop deliveries to Ukraine, which transits Russian gas to Europe, over unpaid bills.

According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Russia last year supplied 167 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Europe’s 270 bcm gas imports.

Some EU countries - such as Bulgaria, Finland, and Lithuania - get all their gas from Russia, while Germany relies on Russia for about 40 percent of its supplies.

It also buys large amounts of Russian oil and coal, but it is easier to switch oil and coal providers, unlike gas, which is delivered mainly by fixed pipelines.

In a sign of Germany and Russia’s ever-closer energy relations, Merkel in 2011 turned on the taps at Nord Stream, a €7.4 billion pipeline to bring Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.

The man who orchestrated the project, former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, now works for Gazprom and speaks out on Russia’s side.

He told German daily Die Zeit on Monday that while Russia’s intervention in Crimea is illegal, Germany should not point fingers because it took part in Nato bombings of Serbia in 1999 without a UN mandate.

He also blamed the EU for causing the crisis by giving Ukraine an either/or choice on free trade ties with the EU or Russia. “That was the EU’s first mistake, which led to the conflict between Kiev and Moscow,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Ukraine crisis has already impacted EU-Russia energy ties.

EU energy commissioner Gunther Oettinger told German daily Die Welt on Monday he has suspended talks with Russia on a legal conflict over the South Stream pipeline, a project to pump more gas from Russia to Europe under the Black Sea.

"I won't accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being, they will be delayed," he said.

A spokeswoman for the EU foreign service noted the same day that EU institutions have begun “preparatory work” on potential visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials, which could trigger a Russian retaliation.

Ukraine itself gets 90 percent of its gas imports from Russia.

But the EU is working on new arrangements to pump up to 8 bcm a year of gas in a “reverse flow” from Germany, Poland, or Slovakia to Ukraine to cut Russian dependence to 60 percent.

EU officials told EUobserver the reverse gas could start flowing in six months’ time.

It would come from a mixture of sources in Europe’s integrated pipeline network. But in the long term, EU countries are increasingly looking to shale gas, from inside Europe and from the US, as an alternative to Russian imports.##193|Empty##194|Empty##195|Empty##196|Why did this happen?

Gox is allowing users to log in to their accounts once again, nearly three weeks after it filed for bankruptcy protection.

Some users reported seeing accurate balances, but on various forums, users were, however, concerned that the exchange's website had been hacked and the new login facility on the site may be a hoax.

"We believe this is an authentic notice on the website and we are confirming with the legal team," a call center staffer said on Tuesday.

Another staffer had earlier said that she was unable to say whether the reactivated login was the result of an order by the Tokyo District Court, adding the database cannot be accessed while the case is being investigated by the court. Lawyers for Mt. Gox could not immediately be reached.

The notice on the website, which was said to have been posted Tuesday by the call center, invited users to log in to check their Bitcoin wallet balances. It's the first access since the Tokyo-based exchange went offline Feb. 25 and later announced it had lost some 850,000 bitcoins.

Some users noted that the reopened access only confirms what they knew before the exchange's meltdown and that their coins remain in limbo.

"The site shows the coins, but it indicates it has no real meaning with respect to claims," said Aaron G., an investor who did not want his last name to be used. His balance indicates about 464 bitcoins (roughly US$286,700 according to average bitcoin prices on other exchanges).

"So, just numbers on a screen -- just as 'real' as they were before Gox went down," he said in an email interview.

Aaron, who filed a fraud complaint against the exchange with Tokyo police, was referring to the legalese on the page citing Mt. Gox's pending status under Japan's Civil Rehabilitation Act.

"Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users," the exchange said on its website.

"I can see the 10k Mtgox stole from me... hooray!" a Reddit user posted in reaction to the reactivation of the login.

The Mt. Gox website said it will post a method for filing claims as soon as it is in a position to do so, without providing details.

The move follows the exchange's filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28 with liabilities of AY=6.5 billion ($63.6 million), when it said 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins were missing, along with 100,000 of its own. Users were left wondering whether they will ever get their bitcoins back.

The rehabilitation procedure is one of several legal actions involving Mt. Gox and its parent company Tibanne, led by Mark Karpeles. Last week a U.S. district court judge ordered a freeze of the assets of Karpeles as well as Tibanne and Mt. Gox's U.S. subsidiary amid allegations of fraud.

Gregory Greene filed the Chicago lawsuit against Mt. Gox on Feb. 27, alleging he lost around $25,000 worth of bitcoins in the exchange's meltdown.##198|It looks like you have reached this page in error ...

Of the Big Four lenders, ANZ and NAB are flat, but CBA and Westpac are both up 0.2%. Meanwhile, Macquarie is 0.2% higher, and Suncorp is up 0.9%, while QBE Insurance and IAG are up 0.5% apiece.

But miners are down, and in some cases down a lot. This, as copper languishes at eight-month lows and, more importantly, spot iron ore saw its biggest drop in four years as investors worried about Chinese demand.

As Rivkin CEO Scott Schuberg puts it in his daily premarket note: “Unlike copper, this market [iron ore] has broken down through recent lows, and we can only sit back and watch as the iron-ore price finds its new home.”

And so, it’s a 2.2% loss for Fortescue Metals and a 2.7% fall for Atlas Iron, though both are off their opening lows. (Atlas was off more than 5% at one point.)

Among other mining-sector casualties, Whitehaven Coal is down 3.1%, and in the gold space, Evolution is down 1.1% and Kingsgate is down 0.8%.

Also on the decline, aluminum-vessel maker Austal is trading 2.8% lower, even after it announced a $684 million contract with the U.S. Navy. On the other hand, Bluescope Steel is up 1%, getting some support from a weaker Australian dollar.

In about an hour, watch for NAB’s monthly business survey, which could, just maybe, move shares.##205|Why did this happen?

Why am I seeing this 'Under Construction' page?##208|Empty##209|POLICE investigating the mystery disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 have raided the house of the chief pilot in a bid to uncover anything strange about his behaviour in the days leading up to the ill-fated flight.

But Malaysian authorities tonight denied the raid even occurred. Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the reports were not true.

Police sources said they had questioned the pilot’s family and are investigating if there were any underlying mental or psychological issues but say it is a routine part of their investigation.

The pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, has been described as an “aviation geek”, devoted entirely to his job and who had more than 18,000 flying hours during his three decades at Malaysian Airlines.

Police have said that as part of their probe into the missing airliner that they are looking at four areas — hijack, sabotage and psychological and personal problems with the passengers or crew.

They have been combing through all the CCTV footage from Kuala Lumpur airport of every passenger and crew member on the flight to witness the behaviour of all 239 before they boarded the plane that evening.

Police sources have confirmed that officers have gone to the pilot Capt Shah’s home to question his family but stress it is a normal part of their investigation and there is no suggestion at this stage of anything untoward or of anything wrong with the pilot.

Malaysia Airlines have described Captain Shah as “a very seasoned pilot” with a track record of excellent service and say there was no indication of anything untoward about his behaviour.

KIWI OIL RIG WORKER ‘SAW BURNING PLANE’

THE MH370 FALLOUT: WHO’S IN CHARGE?

It comes as the search for the missing plane enters its sixth day and now covers an area of a massive 27,000 square nautical miles in two separate areas — the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea.

Authorities are continuing to search in both areas — in the South China Sea where the plane dropped off civilian radar and where Chinese satellites picked up images of what appeared to be debris on the weekend — and in the Malacca Strait, where an unidentified aircraft was logged about 45 minutes later, at 2.15am, 200 miles northwest of Penang.

There have been sightings from people in both areas of what appeared to be a plane at the times MH370 is said to have disappeared.

An oil rig worker has also reported seeing what looked like a plane burning for 10 to 15 seconds from his oil rig, 300km southeast of the Vietnamese island of Vung Tau, in the area where the plane disappeared from civilian radar.

And at least six different groups of locals in the Kota Baru region, on the western side of Malaysia, near the Thai border, have reported seeing a low-flying aircraft between 1.30am and 1.45am on the morning of March 7. The reports come from fishermen, a farmer and a local security officer — all of whom have made police reports.

Police say they are taking all the reports seriously, especially as the fishermen are out in the ocean every night fishing and know well the different flight paths and what is normal and abnormal for aircraft flying overhead.

While the search, with 42 ships and 39 aircraft continues, a police task force is hunting down every detail they can find about all the passengers in a bid to identify anything suspicious.

They are studying video from the Kuala Lumpur airport and looking closely at the behaviour of all passengers and crew in the hours before they boarded the plane.

“We are looking very closely at the video footage taken on the whole of KLIA (the airport) from the seventh (March) until the plane takeoff. So we are studying the behavioural pattern of all the passengers,” Malaysia’s police chief, Insp General Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said.

Colleagues have paid tribute to the chief pilot and have told that Capt Shah was so passionate about this job that he even had a homemade Boeing 777 simulator at his home which he would often use to help hone his skills.

And as a mark of respect to the passengers and crew of MH370, Malaysian Airlines has announced that the flight codes MH370 and MH371 will be retired from the Kuala Lumpur-Beijing routes.

From tomorrow the routes will be renamed MH318 and MH319.

“Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of our colleagues and passengers of MH370,” Malaysian Airlines said in a statement##210|In a saga going back to last autumn, Men’s Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) announced Tuesday morning that it has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (NASDAQ: JOSB) in an all-cash deal for $65.00 a share, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. The final price is $1.50 per share more than Men’s Wearhouse offered in late February.

The story began last October when the smaller Jos. A. Bank offered to acquire Men’s Wearhouse for $48 a share, an offer that was rejected and soon withdrawn. Then Men’s Wearhouse offered $55 a share to acquire Jos. A. Bank. As part of that offer, Men’s Wearhouse said that it “expect[ed] a smooth integration as there will be no rebranding or remodels required — Jos. A. Bank’s store banner will remain in place. Management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both companies.”

In the final deal, Men’s Wearhouse kept its bargain, saying there will be no re-branding and that management “will consist of the most qualified individuals from both companies.” The combined stores will have more than 1,700 locations and pro forma revenue of about $3.5 billion.

Men’s Wearhouse’s offer represents a premium of 56% to Jos. A. Bank’s closing price when the smaller store first made its offer for Men’s Wearhouse. Jos. A. Bank has terminated its agreement to acquire Eddie Bauer as a condition of the merger, which could result in a claim from Bauer’s owner, Everest Holdings. Jos. A. Bank also terminated its previously announced tender offer to purchase up to $300 million worth of its outstanding stock.

The Men’s Wearhouse tender offer to Jos. A. Bank stockholders has been extended to a new expiration date of March 19, and the cash paid per share has been raised from $63.50 to $65.00. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, pending required regulatory approvals.

Men’s Wearhouse stock was up about 5.6% at $57.54, after posting a new 52-week high of $58.80 earlier in the morning. The 52-week low is $28.95.

Jos. A. Bank shares were up about 3.8% to $64.15, after posting a new high of $64.63. The 52-week low is $38.36.##211|the outfit behind Candy Crush Saga, is going to have an initial public offering while the company is doing well. King, the games developer behind Candy Crush Saga, is looking to raise as much as $533m via a share sale on the New York Stock Exchange.

The firm said it is planning to sell 22.2 million shares, priced between $21 and $24 per share. But that could value the company at almost $7.6bn at the top of its pricing range which strikes many as a little steep. King's portfolio includes more than 180 games, but Candy Crush is its most popular offering and was the most downloaded free mobile app of 2013.

The popularity of Candy Crush has been the biggest driver of growth for King during the past two years and before it came up with the game it only made $64m in revenue. Needless to say there are some worries that the firm relies too heavily on Candy Crush and that if its popularity faded, the company's revenue and profits may be hit.##212|Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 5-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal.

The fast food restaurant chain, best known for its oven-toasted sandwiches, filed for pre-packaged bankruptcy protection Friday – citing tough competition in the fast food industry.

Other popular casual eateries such as Subway, Panera Bread, and Chipotle have been taking a bite out of Quiznos in the past few years, as newer competitors like Potbelly make their way into the fast-food market, offering toasted subs at a wallet friendly price to cash-strapped customers looking to save a dime.

Case in point, a turkey sandwich at Potbelly Sandwich Shop costs around $5.50, while a regular Quiznos Pesto Caesar Chicken sub costs upwards of $6.29.

The Denver-based sandwich company said in its bankruptcy petition that it has between $500 million and $1 billion of liabilities. The company’s CEO, Stuart Mathis, said Quiznos plans on restructuring by “reducing food costs (and) implementing a franchise owner rebate program,” per NY Daily News.

The company is seeking to secure a $15 million loan from senior lenders to continue business-as-usual.

Quiznos isn’t the only fast food joint that is falling on hard times recently. Just a few days before their announcement, pizza chain Sbarro LLC filed for its second bankruptcy in three years. The New York-based pizza chain filed for court protection in Manhattan on Monday. Another company in trouble – Hot Dog on a Stick, another purveyor of quick-service food typically found in your local shopping mall, who in February also filed for bankruptcy protection.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (2nd left) hands money to a store owner in Hanoi, October 14, 2013. Li visited the local shop at Monday night. Li bought tea, preserved fruit and lotus seed before leaving the store. [Photo: Xinhua] Chinese Premier Li Keqiang shared the story of an interesting encounter with a shop owner in Vietnam at a press conference following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.



Li says when he was in Hanoi during a tour to the ASEAN countries in 2013, he reached consensus with Vietnamese leaders on a variety of issues including maritime joint development.



He said he wanted to hear what the people there say about China and Vietnam working together, so he left his hotel and visited a small shop in the evening, where the female shop owner recognized him right away.



"She welcomes Chinese customers; certainly they would bring more business to her shop. I asked her about her opinion on relations between neighboring countries, and she wished for people to live in peace and friendship, which I think is also everyone's wish," Li said.



Li has stressed mutual respect for neighboring countries to work in harmony and pursue common interest.



The premier added that people need to work together to maximize mutual benefits and minimize conflict, which would benefit everybody.##220|The Federal Reserve is expected to alter their forward policy guidance to support the economy as early as this week. If the Fed emphasizes that they intend to keep interest rates low, it could be interpreted by the markets as a positive for stocks and risk-taking in general. With the Fed on deck, and given the S&P 500 recaptured an important support level, stocks could experience better than expected outcomes this week.

Guidance Takes Center Stage

The Fed has signaled in recent weeks that the threshold for altering their bond tapering schedule is high. Therefore, the market expects another round of tapering this week. The focus has shifted to forward guidance. In the current economic environment, forward guidance is the Fed’s way of signaling to the markets how long they expect to keep interest rates low. Forward guidance has been tied almost exclusively to the unemployment rate; that may change Wednesday. From MarketWatch:

The Fed’s current pledge is to hold rates steady until “well past” the point when the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. But the unemployment rate has steadily dropped over the past year, before ticking up slightly to 6.7% in February. “It is time to seriously rethink that 6.5% unemployment target because we are so close to it,” said former Fed governor Randall Kroszner in an interview with MarketWatch. Yellen has signaled that she would be comfortable with this change, analysts said, when she told lawmakers last month that the unemployment rate did not fully summarize the health of the labor market.

Vulnerabilities Call For Flexibility

While stocks staged an impressive rally Monday, this week’s stock market outlook video covers numerous observable signs of vulnerability. While vulnerable does not mean bearish, it speaks to the need to pay close attention this week from a risk management perspective.

Keeping An Ear To The Ground

It is always a good idea to review recent writings from The Wall Street Journal’s Jon Hilsenrath prior to a formal Fed statement. The excerpt below also points to guidance being the focus of this week’s Fed statement. From The Wall Street Journal:

New York Fed President William Dudley said on March 6 he thought the Fed should revise the guidance with the jobless rate so close to 6.5%. It was 6.6% in January. With Friday’s report that it rose to 6.7% in February, that takes a little pressure off officials to change their guidance right away. Still, Mr. Dudley said he believed March was the right time to strike new chords on the interest rate outlook. “My personal opinion is 6 ½% is not providing a lot of value right now in terms of our communications,” Mr. Dudley said. “So my personal view is this is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6 ½% threshold because it’s not really providing any great value. I’d rather do it before I reached that threshold.” To be clear, Mr. Dudley remains strongly supportive of Fed efforts to spur stronger growth and bring down unemployment. He said Thursday he was comfortable with the market’s view the Fed wouldn’t start raising short-term interest rates until mid- to late-2015.

Investment Implications – Key Support Still In Play

Just as we noted vulnerable does not mean bearish, the incremental risk-reduction steps we took last week are a form of risk management, not a shift to the bearish camp. The comments from Friday’s article still apply:

Our core positions continue to be U.S. stocks (SPY) and technology stocks (QQQ). Last week our allocation to stocks contracted and our cash position expanded. The market remains in a more vulnerable state, but bearish conviction is not yet strong enough to carry the day, which can be seen in the flattish nature of the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average. The market’s current profile requires a high degree of flexibility. With a Fed meeting on this week’s docket, we must be willing to increase or decrease our equity exposure based on the incoming data and evidence.

The chart below shows the S&P 500 making a stand near a key range. Also note, the slope of the 50-day moving average is trying to turn back up in a bullish manner, which reflects improving investor sentiment relative to last week.

Monday’s return to a risk-on bias allowed us to take a small incremental step on the growth side of the portfolio via the S&P 500 Equal-Weight ETF (NYSEARCA:RSP). If conditions continue to improve, we will further reduce our cash holdings and add to our stock positions.

And one of the largest Bitcoin trading websites has been taken offline, knocking the value of a single Bitcoin down by roughly 3 percent to a record low.

The termination of Mt.Gox, the trading website, has put at risk millions of Bitcoins. The CEO, Mark Karpeles, resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation board of directors, leaving the state of the currency uncertain.

Shortly thereafter, the founder of another Bitcoin exchange was found dead in an apparent suicide in Singapore.

Still, several local business are offering their services and products and accepting Bitcoin as payment.

To understand why businesses would accept the currency of the Internet, whether they be online or brick and mortar, first we need to understand what a Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer payment system. Transactions between two parties are sent and received anonymously through coded messages from one Bitcoin address - a string of randomly generated numbers - to another, similar to sending and receiving emails without having name, location or other identifiable data tagged with it. Its close scrutiny comes from the anonymity of transactions and its unregulated market.

Each Bitcoin is "mined" - a process that involves users confirming transactions in return for Bitcoins - and generated by a unique code. Once a Bitcoin is mined and in the market, it can be sent between users or purchased, much like stocks and bonds can be traded between individuals. Bitcoins are stored in "wallets."

"Think of it as this lottery software that eventually, if it matches, you get the coin," said Richard McGrath, a professor of economics at Armstrong Atlantic State University.

The software that is Bitcoin is seen as a possible alternative to traditional currency such as paper money. Speculators comprise a majority of Bitcoin activity, making price volatility one reason to forgo commercial adoption. It's for this reason, and the appeal of a deregulated and decentralized market away from the prying hands of Uncle Sam, that many believe Bitcoin is a novelty with no real future.

"It's kind of interesting stuff. Is it possible this could take hold over time? Yes," McGrath said. "For a business owner, is the effort in expense worth the payoff? It depends on the business you're in. In the legitimate economy right now, it's a novelty."

Locally, at least four business accept Bitcoin payments: Anonymous Tattoo, Roma Pizza, Kleo's Sewing Studio and an online plant terrarium store sproutsouth. Locations that offer goods or services in exchange for Bitcoin can be found online at coinmap.org.

Zach Acosta was an investor in Bitcoin before he saw the opportunity to bring it to his father's business, Roma Pizza in Bloomingdale.

"I'd like to see it really pick up and us do more transactions," Acosta said. "We've already done, you know, half a dozen now and it's been a couple of months. I'd like to see it take off phenomenally."

They hold about $70 in Bitcoin, though it fluctuates with the market. Customers who use the payment have come simply because of the novelty and an ability to use the currency after seeing a post the son wrote on Reddit, a popular social news website.

"Even if we don't do a lot of transactions it's just good for, you know, visibility and novelty aspects of it," Acosta said.

As a student studying game design at the Savannah College of Art and Design, Will Preston uses Bitcoin frequently, buying the occasional pizza with his roommate or buying gift cards he can then use in stores around town such as Target.

"Really I'm in control of my money in the same way if I were carrying cash in my pocket," Preston said, adding that he liked the advantage of not waiting on holds as he would with a normal bank, though he still banks with a traditional institution.

"If the market was more stable and more places accepted it, if there wasn't so much fear and uncertainty surrounding it, the minute it goes mainstream I'm gonna be on top of it," he said.

For others it's a serious investment for both business and personal financial gains, something Shaun Beaudry has begun instilling in his co-workers at Anonymous Tattoo on Bay Street where he is the shop manager.

"If they save that Bitcoin and don't convert it into cash right away, it will be worth more and more and more and more as time progresses because Bitcoin is deflationary, not inflationary like all of our fiat now," he said, though holding a Bitcoin out of circulation, being that it is a currency with a limited supply, will create volatility.

Beaudry purchased four Bitcoins when they were priced at $15 each. Then when coin value reached about $100 each, he convinced friends to invest in the market. The currency can be divided into eight decimal places, making 0.00000001BTC the smallest amount.

But the market does teeter, though generally upward, which brings into question its stability. So how does one know what they're paying in Bitcoin is the right price in U.S. Dollars?

In-app converters on smart devices make the transactions seem flawless. In entering what the cost of a service is, say $150 for an hour's worth of tattooing, a Bitcoin value is generated based on current market value and the transaction is completed. As an added incentive, the tattoo shop offers discounted hourly rates for anyone who pays with Bitcoin.

"The Bitcoin isn't stable long term," Beaudry said, "but within a few hours it's definitely stable."

Not only does it make promotional sense for businesses to invest in Bitcoin, but the financial practicality of not having to pay credit card transaction fees makes it almost impossible to say no to the digital currency, Beaudry says.

"We pay about 3 percent to credit cards, which you take some businesses' profit margins are 3 percent," he said. "You will double your profits by using Bitcoin, instantaneously."

Beaudry added, "I don't think Bitcoin is going anywhere. I used to be very skeptical of it because I didn't understand it. Now that I understand it, I realize it's not only going to revolutionize how we transfer money to each other, but even the network will change how we transfer stocks, houses."

The Acostas agreed, likening Bitcoins and the fear surrounding them to the adoption of cellphones and credit cards. At first they were scarce. Now it is unlikely to find someone without either.

What's most telling is the first Bitcoin transaction made at Anonymous Tattoo in mid-January to a customer who wanted ink of just that - the Bitcoin logo.##222|Empty##223|Most economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal think the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates before June 2015 despite a falling unemployment rate and improving economy.

The Fed has said it will keep short-term interest rates near zero, where they have been anchored since December 2008, “well past the time” the jobless rate falls below 6.5%.

Also On Atlanta Daily World:##225|Severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest a bit of weakness in the labor market is only temporary.



In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser pointed to U.S. payroll gains in December, January and February. "All three of these numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter weather," he said according to prepared remarks.



A government report on Friday showed U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month after creating 129,000 new positions in January. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.



Plosser is a long-time critic of the Fed's aggressive bond-buying program, which is meant to spur hiring and economic growth, but which policymakers have trimmed in measured steps despite some weak growth in jobs, manufacturing and retail sales in the world's largest economy so far this year.



Aside from the reference to the jobs report, Plosser's speech was largely the same as a speech he gave in London on March 6.



© 2018 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.##226|Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. (NYSE: DKS) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 results before markets opened Tuesday. For the fourth quarter, the sporting goods retailer reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.11 on revenues of $1.9 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $1.03 on revenue of $1.81 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $1.11 and $1.94 billion in revenue. The 2012 fourth quarter included 14 weeks, one more than in 2013.

For the full year, the company reported adjusted diluted EPS of $2.69 on revenues of $6.2 billion. The consensus estimates called for EPS of $2.70 on revenues of $6.21 billion.

Same-store sales for the fourth quarter rose 6.3%, with sales at Dick’s Sporting Goods stores up 6.8% and sales at Golf Galaxy stores down 9.4%. Online sales accounted for 12.2% of total sales for the quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which ended in February of 2013, same-store sales at the Dick’s Sporting Goods stores fell 2.2% in the quarter, rose 1.3% at Golf Galaxy stores and rose 54.2% for the company’s e-commerce business.

The company’s CEO said:

As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omni-channel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings.

The company estimates that full-year 2014 EPS will total $3.03 to $3.08. The outlook for the first quarter calls for EPS of $0.51 to $0.53 and same-store sales are expected to rise 3% to 4%, a sharp increase from a drop of 3.8% in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate calls for first quarter EPS of $0.54 and full-year EPS of $3.11.

The lower-than-expected forecast will weigh on shares. Quarterly results that missed the revenue estimate will add to the weight.

Shares were inactive in premarket trading, after having closed at $54.33 Monday night in a 52-week range of $45.44 to $58.87. Thomson Reuters had a consensus analyst price target of around $61.20 before earnings were announced.##227|Empty##228|Talk to a domain expert: 1-303-893-0552

The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is focused on whether GM, the nation's largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects. The prosecutors, one of the people said, are questioning if GM misled federal regulators about the extent of the problems.

The investigation is the latest in a widening series of threats to GM over its handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.

On Tuesday, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he would ask Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks.

A House committee said on Monday that it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM's recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, and it sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

That agency is also investigating GM's actions since the company learned of possible defects in its ignition systems, in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll of fatal accidents.

It is unclear whether any of the inquiries will lead to charges against GM. If the prosecutors in New York are unable to prove criminal liability, they could pursue civil charges instead.

The federal inquiry is the Justice Department's latest move to investigate how automakers have responded to recalls.

The GM investigation, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company's admission to the safety agency on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches over the last 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.

When asked on Tuesday about the inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the investigation.##230|Quiznos plans to reduce debt by $400 million Quiznos has filed for bankruptcy protection, five days after the Sbarro LLC pizza chain did the same, CNNMoney reported.

Japan’s Nikkei was up 0.1%, after gaining as much as 0.9% earlier in the day, after the country’s central bank made its policy announcement. The dollar also gave up some ground against the yen, with the greenback last at ¥103.27, compared with the day’s high of ¥103.43, and steady with its level in New York late on Monday.

Although there are low expectations for a policy change, investors had been looking for signs on whether the central bank is preparing to expand its stimulus measures later in the year in light of the coming increase in the sales tax.

More broadly, the region was making a mild recovery after weaker-than-expected export data from China led to a selloff across the board, with the benchmark index in Shanghai falling the most since June. The heavy selling on Monday in Asia didn’t turn into a global rout, with Wall Street recording only mild losses overnight, giving markets some space to recover.

The Shanghai Composite picked up slightly, last up 0.3%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose by 0.2%.

Some large Chinese banks edged higher in Hong Kong, as data showed that China’s total credit growth slowed sharply in February. The weaker credit growth came after regulators warned that too much growth could threaten the health of the financial system. China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China both added 0.6%.

In South Korea, the Kospi added 0.1% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.3%. In Southeast Asia, Singapore’s Straits Times Index rose by 0.4% and the Philippines PSE added 0.5%.

Trading in Sydney was recovering from weakness earlier in the session brought about by news that Australian business conditions had fallen sharply in February. The National Australia Bank’s survey said that business conditions, which includes inputs such as labor and purchasing costs, as well as trading conditions, fell to zero in February from a plus 5 score in January.

Miners remained in focus in Sydney, after a sharp fall in the price of iron, which shot 8.3% lower on Monday to its lowest level since October 2012. The large miners, however, gained after sharp losses in the previous session: Rio Tinto added 1% and BHP Billiton was 0.2% higher, after losing 5.8% and 4.1%, respectively, on Monday.

* Bulgaria says South Stream still needs to be built

* Permission to feed more Nord Stream gas into EU also delayed

* Europe seeks long-term alternatives to Russian gas (Adds detail throughout)

By Vera Eckert and Barbara Lewis

FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - Brussels dealt a blow on Monday to two major Russian pipeline projects to supply natural gas to Europe, in the latest sign of strains in the energy links between Moscow and the European Union.

Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region has already shaken political relations between Russia and the European Union.

In Brussels, the crisis is likely to intensify efforts to reduce energy dependence on Russia, while Moscow has long sought to curb its reliance on Ukraine as the main pipeline route for shipping Russian gas to Europe, its biggest market.

Russia has begun building the South Stream pipeline project to carry up to 15 percent of Europe’s annual gas demand via the Black Sea by 2018.

But the pipeline still lacks important approvals to comply with EU legislation, including obtaining exemptions from rules that limit pipeline ownership and require access be provided to other gas firms or utilities.

The European Commissioner for Energy, Guenther Oettinger, told German newspaper Die Welt on Monday that discussions with Russia on the link were suspended.

“I won’t accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being; they will be delayed,” Oettinger, a German national, was quoted as saying.

Commission spokeswoman Sabine Berger said he was referring only to political talks but said he had made clear that South Stream faces a long wait for legal clearance.

The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies warned on Monday that there was “a strong possibility” of a reduction of EU-Russian energy cooperation, which would have substantial economic costs for Europe.

If that happens, the institute said that “the military and political crisis over Crimea and the change of Ukrainian government had catalysed an additional crisis in EU-Russia relations, in the gas sphere”.

Bulgaria, one of the European nations almost totally dependent on Russian gas, said on Monday that South Stream remained of “substantial significance” to Europe and therefore should be built despite the current crisis.

BLOW TO EXISTING PIPELINE

One of Russia’s existing alternative routes to supply western Europe without passing Ukraine, the Nord Stream Pipeline, was also hit on Monday.

Introduced in 2011, Nord Stream pumps gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea into Germany.

But the pipeline is underused, and Russia’s Gazprom says it could pump more if EU rules allowed it full access to the Opal pipeline project, which aims to link northeastern Germany, where Nord Stream makes landfall, to the Czech Republic.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January the Commission had agreed to allow Russia 100 percent access.

But an EU spokeswoman said the executive had delayed a decision on this access, which was initially expected on Monday, citing a need for technical clarification.

“The Commission aims for rapid clarification of the remaining issues and will work on this together with the relevant authorities,” she said.

Opal has capacity of 36 billion cubic metres, but it has been operating at half that for the last three years.

ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES

Russia and the Commission also are at odds over an inquiry into alleged anti-competitive behaviour by Gazprom, including overcharging customers and blocking rivals.

A Commission spokesman said the Ukraine crisis would have no impact on this inquiry.

While Europe lacks immediate alternatives to replace Russian supplies, long-term efforts are in place to reduce Moscow’s dominance in the sector.

In an event that was not directly related but of significance to Russia’s future role in European gas markets, Greece launched an international tender on Monday for a study on the feasibility of a proposed pipeline to access large, recently discovered East Mediterranean reserves from Israel and Cyprus.

There are also hopes that North American shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could come to Europe and help reduce Russia’s influence.

Following a shale gas production boom, the United States is expected to begin exporting LNG from 2015, although analysts say that U.S. exporters would prefer selling to Asia, where prices are twice as high as in Europe.

Noyer, who is governor of the Bank of France, warned that “permanent and deep forces” were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world.

“Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,” Noyer told a conference at the French central bank.

Noyer cited vast slack in many economies as a source of low inflation as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.##241|LONDON—Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Tuesday sought to shield his institution from being dragged further into a global scandal over the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. are investigating a number of banks for possibly manipulating foreign exchange markets. Major firms like Citigroup and Barclays have suspended traders pending the investigation. The scandal touched the Bank of England last week, when it said it suspended one of its own employees.

Appearing before an influential committee of lawmakers to explain the situation, the former Bank of Canada governor said there was no evidence so far that staff at the Bank of England had also colluded in market manipulation or in sharing confidential client information. The suspension, he said, had only been made pending further investigation. Carney yesterday said the central bank suspended the employee last week for not following internal policies on escalating issues. “If something is not escalated we have to make a judgment on where that responsibility lies,” Carney told British Parliament’s Treasury Committee. “We’ve made that judgment and we stand by it.” “The institution has to be beyond reproach,” Carney said. “We have to have the highest standards of integrity.”

The scandal threatens to be more serious than the one surrounding the rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The investigation into Libor, a key rate underpinning transactions the world over, resulted in billions in fines for the banks implicated. The currency trading investigation could have greater repercussions, as it goes to the integrity of the markets rather than just a single rate, however important. The U.K. lawmakers demanded to know what was being done and had been done as the allegations surfaced. Carney said the bank acted to investigate in October as soon as it had evidence of attempts at fixing the market. But lawmakers pointed to minutes from meetings at the central bank held eight years earlier to suggest there had been complaints about manipulation back then. They insisted the bank should have had systems in place to raise concerns to regulators sooner. Paul Fisher, head of markets for the Bank of England, squirmed as he tried to explain to the committee that the minutes from 2006 were being misinterpreted — more a complaint by traders about how tough their lives were than actual accusations that something was going awry in the markets.

But when committee chair Andrew Tyrie described the banks’ oversight systems as “opaque, complex and byzantine,” Carney barely put up a fight. Dealing with a root and branch review of the matter will test his leadership only a year into office. And on that point, he was tough.

“We cannot come out of this at the back end with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England,” Carney said. He said the bank would create a fourth deputy governor to deal with markets and banking. And he also insisted that the integrity of the institution would be safeguarded. The Bank of England’s investigation has so far examined 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chat room records and 40 hours of telephone recordings. No action has been taken so far. The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the sector, launched its investigation last year and said it was examining a number of firms. With files from Bloomberg

The company cut the number of deaths associated with its cars from 13 to 12. General Motors Co. recalled the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5 and other models, which are no longer manufactured for the U.S. market.

The Chief Executive Officer of the company – Ms. Mary Barra has been facing difficulties due to past mistakes of her predecessors. One of the analysts, who work for AutoPacific Inc. – Mr. Dave Sullivan commented the situation in an interview, which was cited by Bloomberg: “Barra is getting her feet thrown right into the fire. There’s no way she is going to come out of this looking like some kind of hero. The best thing is to be honest and upfront and hopefully put this to bed as quickly as possible.”

Not only public disapproval is expected to mark the years that are yet to follow for the company, but also inquiries, lawsuits and government fines. General Motors Co. will face not just a Justice Department probe, but will also the Transportation Department and the Congress, as well as lawyers hired by the company to investigate itself.

As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Fred Upton, who is the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, commented in a statement: “There are several questions surrounding this latest recall, and right now we are just looking for answers to determine what the company and NHTSA knew about these problems, when they knew it, and what they did about it.”

As the Financial Times reported, the Chief Executive Officer of General Motors Co. – Ms. Mary Barra wrote to the company’s employees last week, saying: “Our company’s reputation won’t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward. What is important is taking great care of our customers and showing that it really is a new day at GM.”

One of the spokesmen of the company – Mr. Greg Martin, refused to make any comments on the situation. He only said that General Motors welcomed the opportunity to help “parties have a full understanding of the facts”.

General Motors Co. fell by 0.94% to $34.85 a share in New York by 15:46 GMT, marking a one-year change of +22.77%. The company’s shares have fallen by 15% through yesterday since its post-bankruptcy high of $41.53 reached on December 17th. According to the Financial Times, The 15 analysts offering 12 month price targets for General Motors Co. have a median target of $48.00, with a high estimate of $52.00 and a low estimate of $35.00. The median estimate represents a 36.44% increase from the previous close of $35.18.##247|US stocks have slipped as weak economic data from China and Japan pushes most equity international markets lower.

Record demand for the Jeep Wrangler and launch of the new Jeep Cherokee last year is driving the move to spell full-time employees who are regularly working 60 hours a week, The (Toledo) Blade (http://bit.ly/1cMyWhC ) reported.

"Our people have been working a tremendous amount of hours," plant manager Chuck Padden said. "To get them more time off is important to us, to make sure they're refreshed, and can work safely."

A company spokesman said Monday that Chrysler has hired 380 temporary part-time employees this year, though 50 have been converted to regular, full-time employees. Chrysler has collected applications for all the jobs and is in the process of assessing them.

Most of the new hires will get between 10 and 30 hours per week. They'll be paid $15.78 an hour, the same rate as new full-time hires. They're also offered limited benefits, including health insurance.

How long the temporary part-time jobs last depends mostly on demand for the two vehicles built at the plant.

Bruce Baumhower, president of United Auto Workers Local 12, said the help should take some of the load off employees who have worked long hours for a long time.

"They've worked through the Christmas shutdown the last couple years; they've worked through summer shutdowns," Baumhower said. "Summertime's coming; they've got kids in Little League and other things. They've done an unbelievable job of carrying the load."

The extra help will allow the plant to run the Wrangler line every Saturday, which it hasn't been able to do. That's important to Chrysler, which is trying to squeeze even more Wrangler production out of the plant this year after a record year in 2013.

Padden said Chrysler's goal for the plant is to build 2,000 vehicles a day. Currently, employees at the Toledo assembly complex build about 840 Wranglers and 990 Cherokees a day.##249|Empty##250|Empty##251|Empty##252|The SEALs boarded the tanker Morning Glory late Sunday in international waters. SEALs seize ship from Libyan rebels

American commanders are still determining how and where they’ll hand over a ship full of Libyan oil that Navy special operators seized early Monday on the high seas in the Mediterranean.

A SEAL team attached to the Special Operations Command Europe and the crews of two destroyers helped take control of the oil tanker Morning Glory off Cyprus after three Libyan rebels absconded with the ship last week. A crew from the destroyer USS Stout is helping pilot the ship back to Libya.

Story Continued Below

The ship’s cargo of oil belongs to Libya, but the Morning Glory itself is a “stateless vessel,” the Pentagon said, so it isn’t clear what will become of it once it gets to port.

The SEALs were able to take control of the Morning Glory without firing a shot, confirmed Navy Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for U.S. European Command. The three Libyans who had captured it are under Navy control, and its original crew of 21 is safe, he said. The crew identified by the Pentagon includes six Pakistanis, six Indians, three Sri Lankans and two from Syria, Sudan and Eritrea, respectively.

The SEALs found a few small arms on board, Hicks said, but he declined to give much more of a description of the operation.

“We completely understand the interest in the details of the mission, but will not be able to get into details as it gets into tactics and techniques we may have to use again in theater or elsewhere,” Hicks said. “This is a great capability we rely on to act, when asked, to provide support to the international community to prevent unlawful acts at sea — and respond to them as well.”

President Barack Obama personally approved the raid, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Monday, at the request of the Libyan and Cypriot governments.

The Libyan rebels who took the Morning Glory are said to belong to a breakaway faction that wants to sell state-owned oil on the black market for its own purposes.

SEALs train to land aboard “noncompliant” vessels by dropping down a rope from a helicopter. They also train to approach target ships silently aboard small boats or from underwater. In 2009, special operators parachuted into the ocean from a C-130 cargo aircraft and rendezvoused with the destroyer USS Bainbridge as part of the mission to rescue the American merchant captain Richard Phillips, an operation that was later immortalized in the movie “Captain Phillips.”##253|This will appear next to all of your comments

The Obama administration issued stringent new standards on Friday for health insurance to address a flood of complaints from consumers who said that costs were too high and that the choice of doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs was too limited in many health plans offered this year under the Affordable Care Act. In deciding which products can be sold in the federal marketplace next year, officials said, they will scrutinize health plans more closely and rely less on evaluations by state insurance regulators and private groups that accredit health plans. ...

The Obama administration is requiring health plans in Obamacare insurance marketplaces to include a more robust offering of care providers in 2015 after some early backlash over limited networks in the health care law's first year. Health plans selling on the federal marketplaces in 2015 must include 30 percent of area "essential community providers," which are usually health centers and other hospitals serving mostly low-income patients.

Statement: Anti-Lock Brakes

March 7, 2014 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Chrysler Group is recalling approximately 25,250 SUVs to improve pedal feel during certain aggressive braking maneuvers.



A supplier raised with the Company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop. Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations.



Chrysler Group is unaware of any related injuries or accidents.



An investigation discovered brake-fluid flow was being restricted too much. A software update optimizes flow and restores appropriate pedal feel.



Affected are certain Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs from model years 2012 and 2013 – approximately 18,700 in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico and 5,200 outside the NAFTA region.



Chrysler Group will notify affected customers when to schedule service. Repair costs will be borne by the Company.



Customers who remain concerned may call 1-800-853-1403.##256|Moneycontrol Bureau



US stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq up for the first session in five, as investors grappled with the evolving situation in Ukraine but shrugged off concern over weakness in China's economy.



The EU agreed a framework for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many had expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the effort to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.



But the bigger concern right now is China. The economic slowdown in world’s second largest economy is hammering prices of some raw materials, driving down industrial commodities from copper to iron ore and coal.



Copper has recovered marginally from 4 year low. After sliding to session lows of 6376.25$/ton, weakest level since July 2010, LME copper recovered to end at 6505. Three-month LME copper has shed more than 11% this year.



Iron ore prices continue to trade around 18-month lows. Iron ore is down 22 percent so far in 2014 to USD 104.7/tonne raising comparisons to with the slump in 2012 to below 90, which shut down many miners and left producers rethinking expansion plans.



In other commodities, Nymex held steady at around USD 98 a barrel in early Asian trade on Thursday, after plunging more than 2 percent in their biggest drop in two months overnight as investors turned their focus to the unfolding geopolitical crisis in Ukraine.



From precious metals space, gold was trading near its highest level in six months as investors sought to hedge their bets against geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and economic slowdown fears in China.



Marc Faber, Editor & Publisher, The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report said: “China has never defaulted. That is A) not entirely true. They have been bailed out several times. Banks and financial institutions and companies and I would say that the fact that they haven’t had a major credit problem doesn’t mean that they wont have in future.



I believe that the Chinese economic growth will slow down meaningfully. There is a credit problem. There is no question about it. To what extent it will create an implosion in the economy that we do not yet.”



And in key data to watch out for in US today, weekly jobless claims are seen rising to 330,000. Meanwhile, retail sales could come in higher at 0.2 percent. Also watch out for import and export prices.##257|Empty##258|Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images

Another Obamacare press release, another milestone that falls short of original goals. The Department of Health and Human Services reported today that five million people have now signed up for insurance through the government exchanges. The administration had hoped to enroll seven million by the March 31 deadline. After the bungled rollout, that estimate was revised down to six million.

While total sign-ups still lag both targets, the pace is picking up slightly, as the administration had hoped would be the case in the final weeks and days of open enrollment. 800,000 people applied for coverage so far in March, compared to 1.1 million in all of February. The latest release does not report the ages of enrollees, information that has been closely watched by the administration and insurers. Of particular interest is the percentage of sign-ups who are between the ages of 18 and 34, a healthy demographic needed to keep costs down.

Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) has already turned a corner under the improved management of CEO Myron Ullman, Citi analyst Oliver Chen upgraded the company from Neutral/High Risk to Buy/High Risk and pushed his price target to $11 from $7.50 with an implied 30% upside. The markets responded immediately, and JCP stock was up 9.6% after just a few hours of trading.

Chen’s thesis rests on the idea that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s recent pain is a result of poor decisions made by former CEO Ron Johnson who was pushed out last April, and that weak comps for the rest of 2013 were caused by Ullman accepting the short-term pain necessary to make long-term changes.

“Not so good decisions made under former CEO Ron Johnson, considerably impacted performance in 2013. The Home department was the major tailwind in 1H of the year, while trouble in Kids from a merchandise point of view was the tailwind in 2H,” writes Chen.

J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) has been struggling for years, and short interest hit 30% of total float earlier this year, so the upgrade goes strongly against what most investors expect and seems to have triggered a serious reassessment.

Growth driven by home, kids

Changes to the home division, which had been underperforming for years, cut J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s floor space by about 10% nationwide during 1H13 and impacted sales in other departments as construction drove people away. But the changes seem to have worked, and Home finally increased during 4Q13. During 2H13 the Kids department was forced to make do with less floor space as management tried new ideas that didn’t pan out. Chen believes that simply reallocating more resources to Kids and solid follow through will be enough to meet 2014 guidance if other departments hold steady.

J.C. Penney returns to historic mix of private brands

Additionally, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) is returning to its historic mix of private labels (50% versus 30% under Johnson) whose margins can be as much as 500 bps higher than comparable national brands. At the same time, J.C. Penney has eliminated a number of private brands that were underperforming (JCP Men’s, Stafford Prep, JOE by Joseph Abboud, William Rast, Joe Fresh Kids and JCP Everyday) and reduced a few others so that it can focus on the private brands that have proven to attract customers. Eliminating those brands forced J.C. Penney to take a one-off 190 bp gross margin hit (though it still improved 460 bps overall), but Chen expects to see strong margin improvement this year.##264|Empty##265|Noting at an industry conference Monday that Comcast has tackled big integrations before, Comcast Cable president and CEO Neil Smit said the cable giant has already assembled a small integration team for its pending merger with Time Warner Cable, adding that the initial focus will likely be on upgrading TWC plants to all-digital.

The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is expected to center on whether GM, the nation’s largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects.

The action is the latest in a widening series of investigations of GM’s handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.

On Tuesday, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he would ask Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks, a spokesman for Rockefeller said.

A House committee on Monday said it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM’s recall of 1.6 million vehicles, and sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The NHTSA is also investigating GM’s actions since the company first learned of possible defects in its ignition systems in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own internal review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll of fatal accidents.

It is rare but not unprecedented for the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against an auto company for how it handles recalls.

The department, for example, is currently in discussions with Toyota about settling a four-year criminal investigation into how the Japanese automaker disclosed complaints related to the unintended acceleration of its vehicles.

The GM inquiry, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company’s admission to NHTSA on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches at various times over the past 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.

When asked Tuesday about the criminal inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the investigation.

One safety advocate said the Justice Department investigation is likely to center on whether GM withheld information from government regulators in violation of a criminal penalty provision of the Safety Act.

“It’s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,” said Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington.

Ditlow said the inquiry would probably parallel a special order by NHTSA demanding that GM answer 107 detailed questions about its internal actions and the people involved.

“To impose the criminal penalties, Justice has to find who did the criminal act,” Ditlow said. “NHTSA’s Special Order has multiple questions on who the individuals were in the various acts that resulted in a 10-year delay.”

A House committee is also stepping up pressure on GM to disclose records and documents related to the ignition switches.

Letters signed by Republican and Democratic leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee were sent Monday night to GM’s chief executive, Mary Barra, and David Friedman, the acting head of NHTSA.

In the letters, the committee called for all records of consumer complaints, field reports and reports of deaths, injuries or property damage.

The committee also said it wanted “a detailed timeline of interactions and communications between GM and NHTSA related to stalls, air bags and/or ignition switches in the GM vehicles subject to recall.”

The letters gave the company and the agency until March 25 to reply.

The committee chairman, Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the House inquiry is geared toward finding out whether GM and government regulators complied with reporting requirements in the Tread Act, which was designed to streamline the flow of information on vehicle problems between carmakers and NHTSA.

“We must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress intended to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,” Upton said in a prepared statement.

Once the committee gets the requested information, it is expected to hold hearings that could include testimony by Barra and other GM officials.

The New York Times##271|Empty##272|€7.2bn Vodafone/ONO deal confirmed





Vodafone has agreed to acquire 100 per cent of the share capital of ONO for a total consideration equivalent to €7.2 billion on a debt and cash free basis. Final completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of the relevant competition authorities.

The Transaction accelerates Vodafone’s unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing FTTH build programme.

Vodafone expects to achieve cost and capex synergies with a run-rate of approximately €240 million (£200 million) before integration costs by the fourth full year post completion, equivalent to a net present value of approximately €2.0 billion after integration costs.

Vodafone sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its extensive distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. Vodafone estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately €1.0 billion. The Transaction values Ono at a multiple of 7.5x 2013 EBITDA and 10.4x 2013 OpFCF, adjusted for cost and capex synergies.

Vodafone Group Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said the combination of Vodafone and ONO created a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represented an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. “Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market. We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain.”

The Chairman of the ONO Board of Directors José María Castellano Ríos said: “This transaction reflects ONO’s attractive position as Spain’s leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications. As part of Vodafone, ONO will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect. The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry.”

The Transaction enables Vodafone to take advantage of the rapid increase in the adoption of unified communications products and services in the Spanish market and provides Vodafone with immediate access to 7.2 million homes at a significant time-to-market advantage. ONO’s network is complementary to Vodafone’s fibre-to- the-home (“FTTH”) build programme which will be refocused towards areas where ONO has limited or no network presence. Vodafone intends to complete its FTTH rollout to 1.5 million homes passed, providing it with access to a NGN network covering up to 10 million homes released to marketing, equivalent to 57 per cent of total Spanish homes.

In-market consolidation with substantial cost and capex savings

The Transaction is expected to generate significant cost and capex savings with an annual run-rate of approximately €240 million, before integration costs, in the fourth full year post completion, equivalent to a net present value of €2.0 billion after integration costs. The savings will be primarily derived from utilising ONO’s network for mobile backhaul, limiting Vodafone’s FTTH build plan to the initial 1.5 million homes passed, the rationalisation of overlapping activities and the migration of ONO’s mobile traffic to Vodafone’s network.

Significant potential to accelerate growth in Spain

Vodafone will be able to leverage its extensive distribution network to increase the penetration of ONO’s homes released to marketing, which is currently lower than any other major European cable operator. There is also a significant opportunity to cross-sell ONO’s high quality broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV offerings to Vodafone’s existing customers. Vodafone also expects to be able to cross-sell its mobile services to Ono’s customers and offer new services, using both companies’ product sets and networks. Vodafone estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately €1.0 billion after integration costs.

Significantly value-accretive transaction

The Transaction values Ono at a multiple of 7.5x 2013 EBITDA and 10.4x 2013 OpFCF adjusted for cost and capex synergies. The Transaction comfortably meets Vodafone’s M&A criteria and is expected to be accretive to Vodafone’s adjusted EPS and FCF per share after cost and capex and before integration costs from the first full year post completion.

Ono management and employees

Vodafone values the expertise of ONO’s management team and employees and will work closely with them to support the integration with Vodafone. As in similar recent transactions, Vodafone would expect ONO’s management to become an integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined business. ONO’s employees will also benefit from a broader range of international career opportunities available across the Vodafone Group.

Financing

Vodafone will finance the Transaction from its existing cash resources and committed but undrawn bank facilities.

Reports emerged Friday March 14 that an agreement had been reached which would see the telco acquire the cable group for €7.2 billion

The deal comes soon after ONO’s shareholders had given their approval to an IPO of the company, which now will be dropped.

The new Vodafone will have a share of 21 per cent in the broadband market, with around 2.4 million users and 26 per cent in mobile with 13.5 million mobile users. The agreement with ONO will allow Vodafone to break into the Spanish TV market once more with around 900,000 pay-TV subscribers from the cable company.##273|The prevailing skepticism about tech IPOs is that frothy valuations sans profits are contributing to a bubble. Yet King Digital Entertainment, maker of the highly addictive game Candy Crush Saga is one of the few big mobile companies posting hefty revenues and profits ahead of its own IPO.

While rival games maker Zynga is booking losses and struggling to keep its shares aloft, King.com booked $568 million in profit, on sales of $1.8 billion in 2013. Its limited stable of popular games like Candy Crush and Pet Rescue Saga are free, but players fork out to extend their game sessions, enhance skills and boost their progress, or unlock new levels.

The Dublin, Ireland based company said today that it could be valued as high as $7.6 billion at its IPO after selling 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 per share. It plans to list ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'KING.'

Among is largest investors are Apax Partners, with its 48% stake, and Index Ventures, with 8.3%.

King.com’s regulatory filing also revealed that its founder Riccardo Zacconi, 46, has a 10.4% stake in the company, while his chairman Melvyn Morris, 57, is the company’s second largest stakeholder with 12.2%.

Despite hockey-stick growth since 2012, a point of concern for potential investors might be how the company’s finances have fared most recently. King saw its first fall in quarterly revenue in the last three months of 2013, when sales slipped to $632 million from $648 million in the previous quarter. Net income also slid to $269 million from $290 million.

The company said fluctuations in its quarterly results were a risk for future investors, and that this made future results difficult to predict. It warned that it also faced “significant competition” and that it relied on third-party platforms like Facebook, Apple ’s App Store and Google Play to distribute games and collect revenue.

Meanwhile its free-to-play model is "evolving" and perhaps most concerning of all: King relies heavily on having one or two blockbuster hits to keep revenues flowing. In the fourth quarter of 2013 for instance, an extraordinary 78% of its total gross bookings came from Candy Crush Saga alone.##274|Asian markets tumbled following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.

The losses came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the United States, while investors are keeping an eye on events in Ukraine as leaders try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

Tokyo slipped 1.01 per cent, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93 per cent, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03 per cent lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.

Shanghai dived 2.86 per cent, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75 per cent, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.

Beijing said on Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98 billion in February.

The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8 billion in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $US11.9 billion surplus. Exports fell 18.1 per cent and imports jumped 10.1 per cent.

"It's hard to ignore a number that looks like that," said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.

Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2.0 per cent in February, down from 2.5 per cent in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.

While authorities blame the country's holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness.

The sell-off on Monday is "symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers", he told Dow Jones Newswires.

In Japan the government said Monday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2 per cent in the quarter to December and 1.5 per cent through 2013, slower than first thought.

Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3 per cent in October-December period and 1.6 per cent over the year.

While the data still marked Japan's best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.

In currency trade the yen rose after seeing a sell-off for most of last week. In the afternoon the dollar fell to 103.15 yen from 103.24 yen in New York Friday.

The euro fetched $1.3886 and 143.23 yen, against $1.3874 and 143.31 yen.

The United States provided a broadly positive lead after official figures showed 175,000 jobs were created in February, rebounding from two disappointing winter-battered months, suggesting economic growth is still on track.

On Wall Street the S&P 500 edged up 0.05 per cent to its third record in four days and the Dow gained 0.19 per cent but the Nasdaq fell 0.37 per cent.

In Kuala Lumpur flag-carrier Malaysia Airlines lost 20 per cent at one point after one of its 777 airliners went missing at the weekend with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. However, it clawed back a substantial part of that to sit four per cent lower in late trade.

The broader market was down 0.50 per cent.

Oil prices fell. New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, was down 13 cents at $US102.45 and Brent North Sea crude for April fell 82 cents to $US108.18.

MPs were also told that the rest of the UK was likely to end up bailing out Scotland in the event of a crisis if there was a currency union even if there were explicit guarantees written into an agreement ruling out such an event.

European laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit Scotland, the Treasury select committee heard.

Asked if RBS would have to move to the remaining UK if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: “It’s a distinct possibility but I shouldn’t prejudge it.

“It depends on their arrangements as well, if they were to adjust more into Scotland the minor management of the institution.”

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: “Distinct possibility is a central bank phrase with a sort of layer of lawyer on top.”

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK.

First Minister Alex Salmond’s Scottish Government wants to create a “sterling zone” with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Mr Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to the eurozone.

He told MPs today that the Bank of England did not have to be the lender of last resort to Scottish banks if there was no formal currency union and would be “very conscious of the exposure to the public balance sheet”.

Mr Carney said there would be “advantages” to an independent Scotland if it became part of a EU banking union but it would not have a common deposit guarantee scheme and lender of last resort negotiations would have to be made.

“Does it make it more viable?” he added. “It’s a mechanism, there’s a wide range of factors which would determine viability and viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant. You can’t be half viable in a currency union.

“You need all the components. It would advance it but the other components would need to be put in place so you have to look at the package.”

Mr Carney suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis.

He told MPs: “There’s famously a no-bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but when push came to shove with risks in the periphery that was not fully credible because the spillover effects of not bailing out, or not assisting in some sort of arrangement, were judged, in the teeth of a global crisis, to be too great to risk and so there were extraordinary efforts made, and appropriate efforts, made by European officials to avoid that.

“The issue for the rest of the UK would be would it be credible, I’m not predicting this but one has to plan for contingencies, would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?

“If it is not credible then the structure of the currency union obviously is less than perfect but it is also taking on a contingent liability or responsibility to the rest of the UK balance sheet.

“So, these are all issues that have to be thought through in advance.”

Pressed on whether he was going “a long way down the road of saying” that experience showed any system of rules would be vulnerable to the risk of bailouts, he replied: “My view is that the eurozone needs to build that form of fiscal federalism to be viable.”

Mr Carney dismissed claims that he thought a currency union was a bad idea for the UK and something he did not support.

He said: “I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments.

“At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate.”

When it was suggested that he had created a “less than optimistic picture”, he told MPs his intention was to draw attention to the underlying economic issues.

A Better Together spokesman said: “This is an important contribution from the Bank of England governor. What people in Scotland need is clarity from Alex Salmond about his Plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we have to sign up to the euro, as Mark Carney said, or would we set up an unproven separate currency?

“No doubt Alex Salmond’s response will the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - Mark Carney is wrong and only the First Minister is right. It simply isn’t credible.”

Stewart Hosie, SNP Treasury spokesman and a Treasury committee member, said: “I am pleased that the governor took this opportunity to confirm the Bank of England’s neutrality on the issue of Scottish independence, and that his Edinburgh speech was a technical assessment of currency unions, not a judgment on independence.

“Mark Carney was clear that the issue he wanted to get across was the nature of the stability arrangements which are required for the formation of a successful currency union. I am pleased that the Scottish Government’s Fiscal Commission Working Group have described in detail a blueprint for such a successful currency union.

“He made the point - in terms of stability arrangements - that what would matter is the aggregate position of the economy and of public spending. That is extremely helpful given Scotland’s fiscal position has been stronger on average than the UK’s for over three decades.

“I was also pleased that Dr Carney confirmed that judgments on stability arrangements would be based on aggregate numbers such as debt and deficit. This completely contradicts the No campaign assertion that a ‘foreign country would be running Scotland’s economy’.”##278|Empty##279|##280|##281|WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Americans took a record 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year as an increase in urban living, costlier fuel, more investment and an economic upturn helped drive ridership, an industry group said on Monday.

2013 was the eighth straight year in which more than 10 billion trips were taken on U.S. public buses, subways, commuter rail and streetcars, the American Public Transportation Association(APTA) said in a report.

2013 marked the highest level of ridership since 1956, it said.

“It’s all about, if you build it, they will come. The investment pays off,” APTA President and Chief Executive Michael Melaniphy said in a telephone interview.

Melaniphy said the increase in part reflected increased investment in public transit by the federal government, along with that by states and cities which want to attract new businesses and workers.

The U.S. trend toward urban living and walkable cities also is behind the upturn in ridership. A surge in ridership that came in 2008 when gasoline and diesel prices spiked has continued even though the cost of fuel has fallen, Melaniphy said.

“People are coming and staying,” he said. The upturn in the U.S. economy also means more people commuting to work.

Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent.

The increase has outpaced a 20.3 percent rise in population and a 22.7 percent upturn in vehicle miles traveled, the report said.

Among transport sectors, ridership for heavy rail, or subways and elevated trains, was up 2.8 percent last year. Commuter rail rose 2.1 percent.

Light rail, or streetcars and trolleys, experienced a 1.6 percent increase in ridership. Buses overall saw a 0.1 percent fall, though ridership in cities with less than 100,000 population rose almost 4 percent.

Cities with the largest increases in ridership included:

– Salt Lake City, which saw a 103.3 percent in commuter rail traffic after the opening of a new line in December 2012;

– Austin, Texas, with a 37.3 percent rise in commuter rail use;

– Miami, with an increase of almost 11 percent in heavy rail use, largely because of increased frequency during peak hours;

– and New Orleans, with a 29 percent rise in light rail use.

Release of the report coincided with the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, which is aimed at helping shape federal and industry policy.

Source: GI.Biz##286|Empty##287|The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is quizzed by MPs over claims some of the bank's officials knew about alleged foreign exchange rate fixing.

His appearance before the Treasury Select Committee comes a week after it emerged that some officials were aware of rigging attempts as early as 2006.

The bank said there was no evidence its staff had colluded to rig the market.

MPs are also questioning Mr Carney over other financial issues, including the possibility of a currency union.##290|Image copyright AFP Image caption The firm will be listed in New York

Irish fruit firm Fyffes and US rival Chiquita are to merge to create the world's largest banana company, worth about $1bn (£597m).

The new firm, named ChiquitaFyffes, is expected to sell about 160 million boxes of bananas annually, more than any rival.

"This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies," said Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan.

It will be listed in New York.

In the merger, shareholders will receive shares in each firm, with Fyffes shareholders owning about 49.3% of the combined company.

Mr Lonergan said the deal would help it to save costs and expand the areas it served.

The tie-up came as Fyffes revealed that its profit before tax for 2013 rose 9.8% to 28.7m euros (£23.8m).

It said results in its banana division were "broadly satisfactory", although profits in that division were slightly down compared with 2012's strong performance.

It said "significant inflation" in the cost of fruit and the strength of the US dollar against sterling had both hit performance.

More deals expected

The global market is currently controlled by four firms - Chiquita, Dole Food Company, Fresh Del Monte and Fyffes - according to the United Nations.

"The first three [companies] on a global scale are not too far away from each other, whereas Fyffes was a good deal smaller. Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector," said David Holohan, analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers.

The deal is expected to go through this year, but will be subject to review by competition authorities.

However, Mr Holohan said that because the two firms operated mainly in separate North American and European markets, this was unlikely to be a problem.##291|The General Motors Co. recall involving a faulty ignition switch that is being blamed for 12 deaths in the United States has spread to Canada.

General Motors of Canada Ltd. began sending out letters this week to about 235,000 owners of Pontiac, Saturn and Chevrolet vehicles that are the subject of a recall in the United States as well as a Department of Justice investigation and probes by two U.S. congressional committees and U.S. safety regulators.

The problem is that the ignition switch may move out of the "run" position, causing a partial electrical failure, turning off the engine and rendering the air bags useless if the vehicle is involved in a crash, GM Canada said in a memorandum to dealers. The risk increases if the key ring is carrying more than the car key.

Story continues below advertisement

Until the vehicles are repaired, "customers should be advised that it is very important that they remove all the items from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key," the memo said in boldfaced type.

The recall, which now involves 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, threatens to derail the auto maker's recovery from bankruptcy protection in 2009 and damage the reputation it has gained since then for vastly improving the quality of its vehicles.

GM has acknowledged that it knew about the problem a decade ago and new chief executive officer Mary Barra has promised a thorough internal review so the situation will not repeated.

GM Canada joined its parent company Wednesday in offering owners of the recalled vehicles a $500 rebate toward the purchase of a new 2013, 2014 or 2015 Chevrolet, GMC, Buick or Cadillac model. Customers worried about driving their vehicles before they are fixed will be offered loaners.

The vehicles affected in Canada are: 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalts; 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice models; 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuits; 2007 Pontiac G5 and Saturn Sky cars; and 2003-2007 Saturn Ions.

The $500 cash rebate will not be used as a marketing tool, the memo to dealers said.

"This allowance is not a sales tool; it is to be used to help customers in need of assistance."

The company said it expects to have replacement parts for repairs to vehicles by April 7.

The recall has hurt GM's share price, but any product liability should be restricted to pre-bankruptcy GM, Barclays Bank PLC analyst Brian Johnson said in a note to clients.

GM's trip through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection limited any liability from lawsuits and other actions that were filed before the 2009 bankruptcy filing.

It is possible, Mr. Johnson noted, that regulators could issue fines and customers could file lawsuits against "new" GM.

"The timing of when GM learned of fatalities related to the faulty ignition switches could potentially determine if GM will be held criminally liable," he wrote. The cost of the recall could reach $100-million (U.S.), he said.

Transport Canada said Wednesday that it is still assessing questions asked about the recall.

With files from Associated Press##292|Empty##293|It may be boom times for some restaurant chains, like stars Chipotle and Panera Bread, but don't count Sbarro among those benefiting from the fast casual trend.

The fast food pizza chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years after it tried and failed to boost sales by revamping its menu and shuttering its worst-performing restaurants. In February, Sbarro said it would close 155 out of the 400 restaurants it owns in North America, though it still has more than 800 locations abroad and about 600 owned by franchisees (the latter will not be affected by the bankruptcy).

In its 2011 bankruptcy, the company slashed 80% of its $400 million debt load. This time, it wants to cut another $140 million worth of debt. While Sbarro is inviting other parties to submit offers to buy the company, its main lenders voted to support a "pre-packaged" plan to exchange the debt for control of a reorganized Sbarro.

“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months. The Board and Senior Management Team are committed to ensuring Sbarro’s future growth and success and today’s filing is a necessary step to achieve those goals,” Sbarro CEO David Karam said in a statement.

Sbarro's US restaurants are mainly located in malls, where foot traffic has slowed and food court spending is down. It also failed to adjust to the consumer trend toward slightly more upscale fare.

The Melville, NY-based company was founded in Brooklyn in 1956 by Italian immigrants Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro.

The amount, more than triple the estimated 10-year payments calculated last year in the White House budget proposal, is driven by the companies' increased profitability.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under federal conservatorship since 2008, when regulators agreed to inject capital into the companies to keep them afloat.

They received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds, but they have returned to profitability and by the end of March they will have had paid $202.9 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury.

No one expected them to become profitable again so quickly, but when home prices surged in 2012, they were able to recover more money than expected on soured loans.

The profit projections come in an addendum to President Barack Obama's fiscal 2015 budget proposal.

In a budget proposal last year the administration estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would send the Treasury $51 billion through 2023.

Under a 2012 revamp of their bailout terms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac send a majority of their profits to the Treasury as dividends, and they are unable to repurchase the controlling share the government took when it bailed them out.

Previously, they were required to pay only a 10 percent dividend on their bailout funds in profitable quarters.

Shareholders, including Perry Capital and Fairholme Capital Management, have sued the United States over the changes. They argue that since the companies are returning profits to taxpayers, the government's stake should shrink.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration want to wind down and replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.##295|Empty##296|Empty##297|Empty##298|##299|Empty##300|Empty##301|The U.S. currency slipped against its European major counterparts in the New York session on Friday, as the the U.S. consumer sentiment index fell more-than-expected in March.

When employees at the Los Gatos nail salon where Roshan Bedi gets her manicures recently found out she sold health insurance, they practically froze in mid-polish. Suddenly, everyone was asking her which health plan was best.

Once her nails had dried, she handed out a batch of business cards.

Not long ago, a chance meeting with an insurance agent might have led strangers to start running in the opposite direction — or politely extricate themselves from the inevitable sales pitch. Yet as the March 31 deadline to enroll in a health care plan looms, health insurance agents have become some of the most popular people in town.

“It’s absolutely true,” Kelley Filice Jensen said with a chuckle.

Jensen, who has been in the insurance business for 15 years, said whenever parents at her children’s schools discover her profession, they almost always tell her about a relative who needs advice or help signing up for a plan under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

“People, and their questions, are coming out of the woodwork,” she said.

People like Davlyn Spetch, 34, owner of Action Cleaning Service in San Jose. In late February, she sought out Jensen to help her pick the best Obamacare plan for her 13 employees. Jensen directed Spetch to a small-business plan that will give the business owner tax credits for the employee premiums she pays, but which also allows her employees’ spouses and dependents to qualify for a federal tax subsidy.

“I don’t have the time to read through all the fine print and figure out every little detail of these plans,” said Spetch, who said Jensen proved to be a “gold mine” of information.

While online sites like eHealthInsurance.com and GetInsured.com have taken a bite out of independent agents’ business, problems with California’s health insurance website and the sometimes endless waits to talk to someone at official call centers have won these Rodney Dangerfields of the business world a newfound respect. They quickly became the go-to people for Obamacare.

“Everyone thought that insurance agents would go the way of travel agents,” said Micah Weinberg, a health policy analyst at the Bay Area Council, a business advocacy group. “But here’s the problem: Health insurance is actually more difficult to purchase after health care reform than it was before health care reform.”

Weinberg, an Obamacare supporter who called the belief that buying health insurance would be as easy as buying a book on Amazon “ludicrous on its face,” said he’s steered “every single person” who has asked him about signing up for a health plan to insurance agents.

“These are people who have sold health insurance for a living,” he said. “Everyone else is still involved in on-the-job training.”

Those other people Californians can turn to include the 800 call-center operators at the Covered California insurance exchange’s three sites. In addition, there are more than 5,000 enrollment counselors certified by Covered California. The exchange also counts 10,725 county social service workers who can enroll people in both expanded Medi-Cal and exchange plans. But there also are 11,600 insurance agents who have been certified by Covered California. All are free of charge.

Larry Hicks, a Covered California spokesman, said enrollment counselors can educate consumers on their health care plan options and discuss the financial obligations under each plan, then enroll consumers once they choose a plan. But insurance agents are licensed to actually recommend specific health insurance companies and plans, both on and off the exchange.

“The difference between us is pretty simple,” said Robert Jetter, a seasoned East Bay insurance agent who compares a client’s experience to dining at a cafeteria versus a five-star restaurant.

“The guy in the cafeteria can tell you what the entrees are,” said Jetter, the director at American Health Advocates in Alameda. “But the restaurant waiter can tell you which one tastes best.”

Still, Hicks said, insurance agents aren’t for everybody. Enrollment counselors who are often found at community centers and enrollment events have a different appeal.

“I might be more comfortable walking into an office of the local chapter of the NAACP to sign up than walking into an office of an insurance company,” said Hicks, who is African-American.

Insurance agents say while they’re pleased to be popular, there’s a price to pay.

They generally earn about 4 percent commission for each Obamacare policy they write. And Neil Crosby, spokesman for the California Association of Health Underwriters, an industry group that represents 2,500 health insurance agents in the state, said the process of enrolling people in the new health plans often takes hours to explain — so much time that agents, he said, “cannot get their regular work done.”

Moreover, most agents Crosby talks to say they have so far earned “basically nothing” in commissions because insurance companies are so backed up processing applications and premiums. A lot of them, Crosby said, feel like they’re beating their heads against a wall because of the workload.

“But,” he added, “I will tell you that the majority of agents I know and talk with feel like it’s just part of what they think is the right thing to do. “

(DETROIT) - General Motors knew of scores of complaints about faulty ignition switches 10 years before it finally issued a recall to correct the dangerous defect.

The revelation comes the same day that the U.S. Attorney in New York opened a criminal investigation into what GM knew about the dangerous defect, and a day after a congressional committee launched a probe of its own.

"At the end of the day, you've got a company that knew about a problem with its product, and decided not to resolve it and not to recall the product," said automotive safety expert Sean Kane.

He and scores of others say GM waited too long to recall more than 1.6 million vehicles, including the Chevy Cobalt and Saturn Ion. The recall surrounds faulty ignition switches that cause the engine to shut down, disabling airbags and power steering. According to court records, GM was aware of problems as early as 2004--the same year the Cobalt was introduced.

"This has been a strong pattern of reported complaints by consumers from the very get-go," Kane said.

"Driving down the road, the car suddenly shuts off in the middle of traffic, in the middle of the highway, with oncoming cars. These are all scenarios that are recipes for disaster. In some cases, they did result in disasters."

One of them involved 29-year-old Brooke Melton. The Georgia woman died in March 2010 after the ignition in her 2006 Cobalt switched from "run" to "accessory," causing the the engine to shut off. Her family sued GM, and reached a settlement in 2013.

But before the suit was over, lawyers took depositions of GM officials that revealed that the company knew of the problems for years.

One complaint from 2005 came from the mother of a young man whose Cobalt was stalling two to three times a week, each time his knee hit the ignition. The mother said she was afraid her son would be killed and wanted GM to take the vehicle back.

"How many people need to die," she asked in the complaint, "for this issue to be a recall?"

Regenia Paige has driven her Chevy Cobalt for three years and says she's afraid to be driving it today. Paige has been avoiding highways so, if the worst does happen, she won't be traveling at a high speed.

She said she'll have to wait at least another month before the new fix will be ready for her vehicle.

"I'm very disappointed in the company," Paige said. "They said their customer services is paramount and apparently it's not."

The People's Bank of China announced on Saturday night that it would allow the onshore yuan spot rate to float 2 per cent either side of its daily reference fixing - a doubling of the previous 1 per cent trading band.

The onshore spot rate fell 0.48 per cent yesterday to an 11-month low of 6.1805 against the US dollar. The offshore reaction was milder, with the yuan closing 0.22 per cent lower at 6.1677.

A widening of the yuan's trading band had long been expected, but the timing still took the market by surprise.

Allowing more volatility of the yuan does not mean the currency is going to trade at the extremes of the band right away - its largest one-day move against the dollar last year was just 0.21 per cent - but economists say it could trigger the rapid unwinding of hot money flows into the mainland amid softer economic data and mounting credit risks, with more than 500 billion yuan (HK$631.6 billion) of trust products due to mature in the second quarter.

"While we maintain our longer-term view of further [yuan] appreciation, the potential shorter-term risk of capital outflow, [given the softening economic backdrop] must be acknowledged," said Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Asian currency and rates strategy at Morgan Stanley.

The one-month implied volatility of the offshore yuan surged as much as 36 per cent yesterday.

At least two major banks lowered their expectations for yuan appreciation yesterday. Standard Chartered said the yuan was now likely to breach the level of six against the dollar in the fourth quarter, instead of the second. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it now expected the yuan to end the year at six per dollar, against an earlier forecast of 6.10.

A more volatile yuan means investors who placed bets on one-way appreciation by holding structured products could be forced to liquidate and suffer losses.

For example, the outstanding value of the most popular yuan structured product, target redemption forwards, is estimated at more than US$300 billion.

JP Morgan said the loss point of most of these products was set at 6.15 to 6.20, meaning investors had already started losing money.

Despite the short-term turmoil, economists and traders said there was no reason to worry about the yuan's long-term appreciation.

"This does not mean the medium-term [yuan] appreciation story is over - simply that it no longer can be viewed as a low-volatility, low-risk 'one-way bet'," Standard Chartered said.##315|Empty##316|Empty##317|Empty##318|* Most Asian stock markets firmer after Wall St steadies

* Risk indicators relatively calm, currencies eerily quiet

By Wayne Cole

SYDNEY, March 11 (Reuters) - Asian markets were finding their feet on Tuesday after a rocky ride the previous session, though uncertainty about the true state of China’s economy kept nerves frayed and commodity prices restrained.

Most regional shares edged ahead, with Japan’s Nikkei adding 0.6 percent and the major European bourses were seen opening up around 0.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan put on 0.3 percent, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday.

Shanghai was flat so perilously close to its lowest since last July, while prices for industrial commodities stayed under water in the wake of February’s shock fall in Chinese exports.

Dealers were especially nervous about iron ore following an 8 percent slide on Monday that fuelled unease about the health of China’s giant steel sector.

Brent crude lost a further 16 cents to $107.92, while U.S. oil extended its decline to $101.06 a barrel.

There was some relief that rates in Chinese money markets were not showing much strain while the yuan was fixed in line with expectations.

Wall Street also managed to end steady on Monday after recouping early losses. The Dow Jones industrial average ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P 500 lost just 0.05 percent.

Other popular indicators of risk were benign. The stock market’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended little changed after an early spike, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent.

Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the U.S. dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies.

Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, stabilised at $0.9030 after losing half a U.S. cent on Monday.

The euro held rock steady at $1.3870, while the dollar inched up to 103.27 yen.

The Bank of Japan on Tuesday reaffirmed a commitment to massive monetary stimulus at its regular policy meeting, but downgraded its view on exports following soft data recently.

Nothing new was expected at this meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April.

The Japanese economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent annualised pace in the last quarter of 2013 as net exports proved a major drag, intensifying pressure for fresh action form the central bank.

Gold was a shade firmer at $1,341.70 an ounce on Tuesday as fears of an economic slowdown in China and Ukraine’s geopolitical crisis keep investors seeking safe-haven bullion.

In a sign of investor confidence in the precious metal amid global uncertainties, the world’s biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday.##319|The company behind the addictive blockbuster game Candy Crush Saga believes it could raise nearly $US613 million ($A685 million) in an initial public offering.

Metro-North says James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital after he was struck by a passenger train while working near 106th Street on the Park Avenue viaduct shortly before 1 a.m Monday morning. He had worked with the railroad for eight years.

He was working with a crew assigned to restoring power to track that had been closed for the weekend.

The railroad says he was struck at 12:54 a.m. by the 12:47 a.m. train en route to Poughkeepsie, on its regular schedule. Why the crew was along this certain section of track is being investigated.

Senator Charles Schumer held a press conference at Grand Central Terminal to question the safety improvements the MTA has put in place.

Senator Schumer said he did not think a federal take over of the railroad is an option to discuss now.

The NTSB and the FRA are investigating the incident along with Metro-North and the MTA Police Department.

“The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff’s family,” said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti.

“Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad. With our partners at the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, we will re-examine our procedures and protocols to ensure we are performing our jobs with safety as the paramount concern.”##322|Bitcoin

Mt. Gox, the embattled Bitcoin exchange, has updated its Web site to allow its users to see account balances.

The Japan-based company opened user accounts for inquiry on Tuesday, but cautioned that the amount of bitcoins they seemingly have would not "constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims." The wording on the Mt. Gox web site is in place to protect Mt. Gox in its ongoing bankruptcy procedures and to ensure that its users don't misconstrue the balance as the actual amount they may or may not be owed.

The balances are based on data collected shortly before Mt. Gox shut down several weeks ago.

Mt. Gox has brought its share of controversy to the Bitcoin world since it was hacked and thousands of bitcoins were surreptitiously taken from user accounts. After admitting to the intrusion, Mt. Gox was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. How or when it might eventually emerge from bankruptcy is still far from being settled.##323|Empty##324|Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) continues to be a battleground between investors and short-sellers, made more prominent by big-name hedge-fund managers Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman taking aggressive positions on opposing sides of the stock.

Satellite images of possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have been released on a Chinese government website.

The three images show what appear to be large, floating objects in the South China Sea. Previous sightings of possible debris have proved fruitless.

Vietnam and Malaysia have sent planes to the area to investigate.

The Beijing-bound plane took off from Kuala Lumpur late on Friday, vanishing about an hour later.

No distress signal or message was sent from the plane, which had a total of 239 passengers and crew on board.

The three images are:

The images were taken on Sunday, a day after the plane disappeared, but were only released on Wednesday on the website of China's State Administration for Science.

Analysis With 154 Chinese citizens on board the missing jet, China has redeployed at least 10 of its satellites to help in the search. The photographs of the three objects, the largest of which measures around 24 metres by 22 metres, were taken on Sunday, the day after the plane vanished, but were only published on Wednesday. The wingspan of the missing Boeing 777 is around 61 metres. The satellite images place the objects 150 miles (250km) or so from the aircraft's last known position over the South China Sea and 250 miles from an oil rig on which a worker reported seeing a burning object in the sky on Saturday morning.

China's civil aviation chief Li Jiaxiang said: "Chinese satellites have found smoke and floating objects... At present we cannot confirm this is related to the missing aircraft."

Vietnam's deputy transport minister said Vietnamese planes had already searched the area but would do so again.

Meanwhile, Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said aircraft had been dispatched to the area to investigate.

Agence France-Presse quoted US officials as saying that US spy satellites had detected no sign of an explosion in the area at the time. The system has detected such heat signatures in the past but none was discovered this time, the officials said.

'All right, roger that'

On Thursday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged Malaysia to step up the search.

"The Chinese government has asked the relevant party to enhance co-ordination, investigate the cause, locate the missing plane as quickly as possible and properly handle all related matters," he said.

China says it has deployed several warships, military aircraft and high-resolution satellites controlled from the Xian Satellite Control Centre in northern China to help search for the jet.

Earlier, Malaysian authorities revealed that the last communication from the jet suggested everything was normal on board.

Flight MH370 replied "All right, roger that" to a radio message from Malaysian air control, authorities said. Minutes later all contact with the plane was lost.

The area where the latest images were taken appears to be close to where the initial search took place.

Malaysian officials have since widened the search to the west of the peninsula amid reports that the plane could have tried to turn back or - for reasons that are not clear- turned west towards the Malacca Strait.

Malaysia said it had also asked India to join the search near the Andaman Sea, suggesting the plane might have reached those waters after crossing the Malacca Strait.

Earlier on Wednesday, Malaysia's air force chief Rodzali Daud denied remarks attributed to him in local media that the flight had been tracked by military radar to the Strait.

Gen Rodzali Daud said he "did not make any such statements", but added that the air force had "not ruled out the possibility of an air turn-back".

China's foreign ministry has complained that there is "too much confusion" regarding information released about the plane's flight path.

There were 153 Chinese nationals on the flight.

"It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein dismissed the allegations and said that Malaysia would "never give up hope" of finding the plane's passengers and crew.

"It's only confusion if you want it to be seen as confusion," he told a press conference.

"I think it's not a matter of chaos. There are a lot of speculations that we have answered in the last few days," he added.##326|Home » Latest News

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The sales value of residential homes in China went down 5 percent year on year to 598.5 billion yuan (97.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the first two months of 2014, latest government data showed.

The amount of housing floor space sold during the period went down 1.2 percent year on year, according to the data released on Thursday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

During the two-month period, gross sales of properties including residential housing, offices and commercial premises totaled 709 billion yuan in value, down 3.7 percent year on year. Total floor space sold reached 104.66 million square meters, down 0.1 percent, the data showed.

Property developers invested in real estate development at a slower rate because of falling sales. They invested 795.6 billion yuan during the period, up 19.3 percent year on year. However, the growth rate fell by 0.5 percentage point compared to the same period last year, the data showed.

The NBS data report said that residential housing accounted for 68.2 percent of developers' real estate investment during the period. Investment in residential property grew 18.4 percent year on year. The growth rate dropped 1 percentage point from a year ago.

Meanwhile, an index reflecting vitality of real estate development stood at 96.91 points in February, down 0.3 point from December, the data showed.##327|Empty##328|Empty##329|Empty##330|Empty##331|Empty##332|Empty##333|VIENNA, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit unit Bank Austria expects to be able to sell its Ukraine business within a year, but this depends on events in the country, its finance chief said on Tuesday.

The Ukraine issue was the biggest concern at the end of last week ahead of Sunday's referendum where residents were voting on whether to break away from Ukraine and join Russia.

Analysts said that there wasn't a lot of doubt about the outcome of the vote as Crimea has a high proportion of Russian-speaking people. But there is uncertainty about how western countries will respond.

"What we're worried about to some extent would be the risk of some more serious deterioration in Russia-G7 relationships and eventually the possibility of more serious economic sanctions," said Jean-Francois Dion, portfolio adviser at RBC Wealth Management.

G7 countries, which include Canada and the United States., have called the vote illegitimate and say they won't recognize the results.

They have also warned there will be costs if Moscow moves to annex Crimea, where Russia has major naval installations.

Questions about Chinese growth and the health of its financial system will also weigh on markets in the wake of soft export, retail and industrial production numbers released last week that raised doubts on whether the country can reach its stated goal of 7.5 per cent growth this year.

The country's first-ever corporate bond default March 7 also created tensions over worries about the health of other companies.

Those concerns had the effect of pushing copper prices down about 10 per cent last week to mid-2010 levels while the TSX base metals component tumbled a similar amount.

That is because copper is commonly used for financing in China and there are worries that further defaults could result in large amounts of copper being dumped on the market, further depressing prices, if companies can't access credit.

"This default that occurred really caught people's attention," said Andrew Pyle, associate director, wealth management, senior wealth adviser and portfolio manager at ScotiaMcLeod in Peterborough, Ont.

"If there is a liquidity squeeze, if firms now need access to credit, they're going to have to go to these (copper) inventories and they are going to have to liquidate. The fact copper has fallen as fast as it has in the last week has as much to do with that as anything (else)."

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve makes its interest rate announcement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a news conference with newly minted Fed chair Janet Yellen.

Traders will be looking for any change in a gauge the Fed is using for interest rate guidance -- the jobless rate. Generally, markets aren't expecting a rate hike from the Fed until the middle of next year at the earliest.

Also, the Fed will likely send the message that the economy is strong enough to carry on with its program of cutting back on its bond purchases, the stimulus program that kept long-term rates low and encouraged a strong rally on stock markets.

"The Fed is going to require several more months before they can start shifting their guidance towards a change in interest rate direction," added Pyle.

"Right now, we're in the middle of tapering, so everything from a guidance point of view is gong to be aimed at tapering, at least for the next several months."

The TSX shed 0.7 per cent last week, with base metal sector losses of 11 per cent balanced somewhat by a gain of about five per cent in the gold sector. The Dow industrials fell heavily, losing 2.35 per cent on the week.##339|Empty##340|It looks like you have reached this page in error ...

King Digital Entertainment Plc, the maker of hit game Candy Crush Saga, expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month as the Irish company looks to take advantage of strong demand for technology investments.

King Digital said it expected to price its IPO of 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 per share. At the top of this range, the company would be valued at about $7.6 billion.

The offering is scheduled to be priced on March 25 and the stock will start trading on March 26, two underwriters told Reuters.

The Dublin-based company will sell 15.5 million shares in the offering, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.

King is hoping to benefit from a shift towards mobile platforms, social networks and app stores. The company derived 73 per cent of gross bookings from mobile users in the fourth quarter ended December 31.

The King IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million at the top-end of the planned range. It filed for a $500 million placeholder in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 per cent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing. CEO Riccardo Zacconi, who has led the company since it was founded in 2003 in Sweden, will have a 9.5 per cent stake.

Candy Crush Saga, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and the year's top revenue-grossing app.

It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra lives.

King offers 180 games in 14 languages through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website, but is heavily reliant on Candy Crush, which brings in about three-quarters of its revenues.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day, the filing showed.

King said it has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING". JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.

The successful IPO of Twitter Inc in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's share price have fueled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including music-sharing service Spotify, lodging service AirBnB and payments company Square.

King should also get a boost in its US initial public offering (IPO) from a surge in shares of digital coupon company Coupons.com Inc after it went public on Friday. Shares of Coupons.com doubled after being priced above the company's planned IPO range.

By Aman Shah

March 12 (Reuters) - King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game “Candy Crush Saga”, expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

“Candy Crush,” which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King’s revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

“I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock,” said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc’s successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc’s shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

“I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a scepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace,” said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

“The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark.”

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

ANOTHER ZYNGA?

“Candy Crush” launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra “lives”.

Such stellar popularity has helped King’s revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fueled by “Candy Crush” rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at Dec. 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.

Zynga’s stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of “Farmville” waned, while Finland’s Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of “Angry Birds”.

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King’s revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in “Candy Crush” gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as “Pet Rescue Saga” and “Farm Heroes Saga”. About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (r.reuters.com/bar57v).

“The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion’s share of time spent.”

NYSE DEBUT

King’s IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KING” on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company’s games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

DigitalGlobe, which owns and operates private imaging satellites, has joined the crowd in an effort for scanning the areas of Gulf of Thailand through its satellites, where the plane is suspected to have crashed into the water.

The flight with 239 passengers on board lost its communication with the ground, on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur which is untraceable for the third consecutive day.

"DigitalGlobe activates FirstLook that is used during natural disasters and man-made crisis by emergency response agencies, while Tomnod is activated for different and selective purposes," explained Luke Barringto, senior manager of Geospatial Big Data for DigitalGlobe. The images taken from these satellites is positioned around 400 miles above the ground.

In the missing Flight MH370 case, the images are made accessible to the public - which is a concept called crowdsourcing. The aim behind crowdsourcing is to survey the images with the help of many viewers in an attempt to find possible clues.

"We try to use the crowd wisely and not tire them out. The story here is much more about the search than it is about the response. This whole feeling of not knowing, the lack of information or ability to do anything, we have seen time and again, is why people want to get involved," Denverpost quoted Barrington saying.

Through the Tomnod website, people can review the images and help locate something of interest.

Tomnod, within the first hour of its crowdsourcing on Monday, had 60,000 page views and over thousands tags.

3,200 square kilometres of imagery has been made available for people to search online and over the next 24 hours, more images are likely to release.

"For people who aren't able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean to get to the Malaysian peninsula, or who cannot fly aeroplanes to look there, this is a way that they can contribute and try to help out," ABC News quoted Barrington.

Users can zoom in for the satellite images and send a message, if they find anything that could be a wreckage. An algorithm will be used to find the overlapped tags, where multiple people have found something noteworthy.

Expert analysis will then identify the most prominent areas and share the useful information with the authorities for further investigation.

"We'll say here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations. Is it really an aircraft wing that's been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go, pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I'd start." he said.

Currently, the images that are available to search are region where Gulf of Thailand meets the South China Sea.##344|

DENVER — As New Jersey debates the merits of legalizing marijuana, at least one state has reaped rewards from such legislation.

Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.

New Jersey has a long way to go before its in Colorado's shoes.

The state signed a medical marijuana law four years ago, but patient advocates have complained that the program is too expensive and few doctors are willing to participate.

State Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said last month he wants to take after Colorado and Washington state and legalize the sale and possession of marijuana in New Jersey.

Star-Ledger reporter Naomi Nix and The Associated Press contributed reporting.

Vodafone agreed to buy Ono in an all-cash deal valuing the Spanish cable company at 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion), including debt. Ono, which is backed by private equity firms Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital, had been preparing an initial public offering.

In a statement on March 17, the UK mobile telecom operator said it expects to make savings on cost and capital expenditure worth 2 billion euros on a net present value basis, or 240 million euros a year, before integration costs, by the fourth full year after completion. It said boosting revenue from cross-selling products should be worth another 1 billion euros.

Vodafone said it will refocus its plan to build out fibre networks in Spain with French telecoms operator Orange towards areas where Ono has little or no network presence. The rollout to 1.5 million homes will allow Vodafone to reach 57 percent of Spanish homes.

It's the voice, stupid. Where Mervyn King always sounded brittle and defensive, Carney has a delivery that sounds as if it's been forged out of whisky, quaaludes and late nights listening to Joni Mitchell. Even when he was telling you that you were completely broke all you would hear is this soft Canadian lilt saying, "Chill out, dude. The powder's great today. Let's go snowboarding." Or you would if you could stay awake to the end of one of his sentences.

Carney, up before the Treasury select committee, was as intensely relaxed about everything as ever. Was he worried about a housing bubble? Nah, not really. "Though we have to be alert to that possibility," he replied, with one eye closing. Would it be a problem if businesses went bust if interest rates went up? The eye briefly reopened. "It would be an issue, not a problem."

How did he feel that the economy was in a far better state than he had predicted? "Like, stop hassling me, man. Things are good. Real good. Just enjoy it. This forecasting thing can be really heavy shit sometimes." (In effect.) Was there any danger he might keep the cash tap turned on and interest rates low for another year just to quantitatively ease the Tories through the election? "Hell no! Do you think I'm on amphetamines?" (More or less.) Carney's reputation for sound economic judgment as governor has been built on doing not very much and doing that slowly. And he's not about to change tack anytime soon.

Then came Scotland. This was more of a two eye problem. If the Scots gained independence, he said, then the head office of the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move to London. This came as a bombshell to the committee, but for Carney it didn't seem that big a deal. It's not like it would be moving from Montreal to Vancouver, his demeanour suggested. Besides, the snow is just as bad in Edinburgh as it is in London.

Danny Alexander has rather less reason to be intensely relaxed. Having spent the last four years being more Tory than the Tories, the chief secretary to the Treasury is now anxious to reposition himself back as a Lib Dem before next May's election and a possible leadership contest with Nick Clegg. So he could probably have done without being left to take the plaudits for carrying out Conservative policies from the Tory backbenches at Treasury questions in George Osborne's absence.

He also probably regretted saying that "the British people need to know that what every party says is what it means" in answer to a question about having election promises audited. You would have thought that might be a subject the Lib Dems would choose to avoid.

At least there was someone having an even worse day. Having been ticked off by the Speaker for giving the wrong answer to an earlier question, Sajid Javid, the economic secretary, blundered straight into an obvious Labour set-up about the failure of the chancellor to appoint any women to the monetary policy committee. "Appointments to the MPC should always be on merit," said Javid. Whatever the right answer may have been, this was very much the wrong one.

On days like these, Javid must wonder whether it was worth taking a 98% pay cut from his job running the Singapore office of Deutsche Bank to become a politician.

A weekend on the half-pipe with governor Carney would do him the world of good.##352|NEW YORK: U.S. stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq up for the first session in five, as investors grappled with the evolving situation in Ukraine but shrugged off concern over weakness in China's economy.The EU agreed a framework for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many had expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the effort to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.London copper prices, a proxy for economic health due to the metal's broad industrial use, hit their lowest since July 2010 on concerns about credit problems in China, but later rebounded.

Mortgage rate data from Freddie Mac, who publishes a weekly mortgage survey of more than 100 bank across the country, for the week of March 6th indicated that mortgage rates dropped substantially during the first week of March. Keep in mind that banks submit their "prime rates" (ie, their best offers) as part of the survey so your individual rate quote may vary. Prime borrowers are those with credit scores of 740 or higher who put 20% down and have an acceptable debt-to-income ratio. Here's what the rates looked like this week:

Rates Breakdown

30 year fixed-rate mortgages saw their largest rate drop since November losing 0.09% points and currently sitting at 4.28%, the second lowest rate since we saw 4.23% back during the first week of February.

15 year fixed mortgage rates also fell. They ended the week down at 3.32% which is the lowest they've been since the 27th of November.

5 year adjustable rate mortgages ended up at 3.03% for the week. This also represents their low for the year and the lowest the rate has been since the last week of December 2013.

1 year adjustable rate mortgages held steady at 2.52%, 0.05% points off of their 2014 high.

For historical context, last year at this time the 30-year FRM was at 3.53%, the 15-year FRM at 2.77%, the 5-year ARM at 2.64%, and the 1-year ARM at 2.61%.

Here's a look at rates during the past month:

Feb 6, 2014 Feb 13, 2014 Feb 20, 2014 Feb 27, 2014 Mar 6, 2014 30 year fixed 4.23% 4.28% 4.33% 4.37% 4.28% 15 year fixed 3.33% 3.33% 3.35% 3.39% 3.32% 5 year ARM 3.08% 3.05% 3.08% 3.05% 3.03% 1 year ARM 2.51% 2.55% 2.57% 2.52% 2.52%

Even though it was a week light on economic report releases, mortgage rates were influenced by the March 7th jobs report where employers outperformed expectations and added 175,000 new jobs to the workforce.

According to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s Weekly Survey, mortgage applications for the week of March 6th increased 9.4 percent from the prior week once seasonal factors were taken into account. However, the mortgage loan application volume is still down 49.3 percent since this time last year and the refinance share of mortgages dropped to its lowest level in over six months at 57.7 percent. Adjustable rate mortgages remained at last weeks level of 8 percent of total mortgage applications.##357|"The strong February jobs report gives ammo for the Fed to continue tapering its stimulus program by $10 billion a month through 2014," Robert Morgan of Fulcrum Securities wrote in response to the survey.

There are greater divisions emerging over what happens next year, however. About 60 percent see the Fed hiking interest rates in 2015 and 40 percent look for it to wait until 2016 or later. While 60 percent see the Fed maintaining its large balance sheet, now at $4.1 trillion and growing, 40 percent see the Fed reducing it, which can happen either through asset sales or by not replacing bonds that mature. Those who think the Fed reduces the size of its balance sheet in 2015, look for an average decline of $108 billion in 2015.

An overwhelming 95 percent of respondents think Yellen and the FOMC will scrap the guidance that says the Fed will consider raising interest rates once the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent, but they are unclear how the Fed fixes the problem. The rate has already declined to 6.7 percent and Yellen and other Fed officials have said that it does not tell the full story of excess slack in the labor market and the need for continued low rates.

"They will use Yellen's first press conference to move away from the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold," said Diane Swonk of Mesirow Financial.

About half of respondents think the Fed will drop a numerical target all together. A fifth of respondents think the threshold will be replaced by another number, with the average being 5.6 percent.

"Fed policy is not going to be bound by single hard numeric unemployment targets, but by the Fed's judgment of the strength of the labor markets," wrote Rod Smyth of Riverfront Investment Group.

Tony Crescenzi of Pimco called removing the threshold, together with an end to the bond-buying program, "a recipe for a steep yield curve, because longer maturities tend to bear the burden of uncertainty."##358|Has the age of the cash register come to an end? Consumers increasingly report they would prefer to pay for goods and services via a credit/debit card or digital bank account, and a recent Javelin study found that cash is no longer is the dominant exchange in point-of-sale systems (it was surpassed by debit and credit cards). There’s another simple way to think about this: When was the last time you carried cash in your wallet? I know I don’t. How can a company adapt to this change?

Digital Currency

Few topics in the world have garnered as much attention as digital currency (also known as cryptocurrency). The biggest name in this arena is BitCoin, a fully digitized currency that conforms to the laws of supply and demand just like international dollars, pounds, euros and yen. The Wall Street Journal notes that it’s possible to use bitcoin to purchase everything from a pizza delivery to a vacation trip to space. A business that accepts bitcoins can turn around and sell them for USD as soon as they receive them for payment. All that is necessary is to set up a digital checkout that takes this e-currency.

Be care with BitCoin. I’m not sure how the success or failure of these digital currencies are going to play out. Usually there are a few very informed parties (people) that make a lot of money at the beginning, while the rest of us are left wondering about the legitimacy of a new currency. If you want to use a digital currency like BitCoin, make sure you know the in’s and out’s and do your research! That being said, there is still a chance for lucrative outcomes by choosing to participate in new digital currencies, especially if your target market is using them. Start with some market research and if your customers are asking for the ability to pay in BitCoins. give it to them, just make sure you turn it into real cash asap.

Point of Sale

When you no longer need a cash register in order to handle sales, do you still need a cashier? More importantly, do you still need a store? This is the big question that brick-and-mortar businesses need to ask themselves. With the change of pace in consumer purchasing, it’s possible to make your sales processes capable of remote transactions. Services like Intuit even show business owners how they can set up a POS solution on a mobile device, so it’s possible to make a sale away from your office or storefront. With no reason to limit your sales to your four walls, why limit the rest of your business to physical boundaries?

Let’s be real.

If you have a physical office location because you believe it adds legitimacy to your business, you’re wrong. Save that monthly rent and put it towards a new website redesign because your digital real estate is the only thing that matters these days. There are tools like Free Conference Call, Google + For free video chatting, and Regus if you really need a place to have a meeting.

Paying It Forward

With the rapid decline of cash in favor of credit cards, it’s fair to ask how much longer credit cards will be around before they, too, turn into dinosaurs. Tech providers suggest it may be sooner than we think. Nokia and BlackBerry have incorporated near-field communications technology (used to capture credit card data) into their smartphones since 2011. With NFC settings on a mobile or tablet (and Apple’s newest generation of iPads), it’s possible to turn a mobile device into a credit card that you can scan at everything from a Starbucks to a Honda dealership to make a payment.

There’s a downside to mobile integration, however: security. Lookout Labs reports that $30 billion worth of cell phones are stolen, lost, or destroyed per year in the United States alone. Losing $20 in cash represents a one-time hit to your budget; losing your credit card-enabled phone can mean far more.

The Bottom Line

Consumers no longer want to deal with cash and change. Many more do not even want to pull a card out of their wallets, preferring to integrate their transactions and their favorite devices. Companies who are not only capable of handling mobile processing, but those who can turn it into a trustworthy transaction, will be better situated to net more sales and higher yields.##359|Empty##360|

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Officials revealed a new timeline Monday suggesting the final voice transmission from the cockpit of the missing Malaysian plane may have occurred before any of its communications systems were disabled, adding more uncertainty about who aboard might have been to blame.

The search for Flight 370, which vanished early March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, has now been expanded deep into the northern and southern hemispheres. Australian vessels scoured the southern Indian Ocean and China offered 21 of its satellites to help Malaysia in the unprecedented hunt.

With no wreckage found in one of the most puzzling aviation mysteries of all time, passengers' relatives have been left in an agonizing limbo.

Investigators say the Boeing 777 was deliberately diverted during its overnight flight and flew off-course for hours. They haven't ruled out hijacking, sabotage, or pilot suicide, and are checking the backgrounds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members -- as well as the ground crew -- for personal problems, psychological issues or links to terrorists.

Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out that it might be discovered intact.

"The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope," Hishammuddin said at a news conference.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane -- "All right, good night" -- were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. A voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have been clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course.

Malaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner's data communications systems -- the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System -- had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.

However, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS -- which gives plane performance and maintenance information -- came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.

The new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane's transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.

Turning off a transponder is easy and, in rare instances, there may be good reason to do so in flight -- for example, if it were reporting incorrect data.

The Malaysian plane does not appear to fit that scenario, said John Gadzinski, a 737 captain.

"There is a raised eyebrow, like Spock on Star Trek -- you just sit there and go, 'Why would anybody do that?"' Gadzinski said of what he is hearing among pilots.

Other pilots in the United States cautioned against reading too much into what little is known so far about the actions of the Malaysia Airlines crew.

"You can't take anything off the table until everything is on the table, and we don't even have an aircraft," said Boeing 737 pilot Mike Karn, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.

Authorities have pointed to the shutdown of the transponders and the ACARS as evidence that someone with a detailed knowledge of the plane was involved. But Bob Coffman, an airline captain and former 777 pilot, said that kind of information is not hard to find in the digital age.

Authorities confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot in what Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar initially said were the first police visits to those homes.

But the government, which has come under criticism abroad for missteps and foot-dragging in releasing information, issued a statement Monday contradicting that account, saying police first visited the pilots' homes as early as March 9, the day after the flight disappeared.

Coffman said the flight simulator could signify nothing more than the pilot's zeal for his job.

"There are people for whom flying is all consuming," he said, noting some pilots like to spend their off-duty hours on simulators at home, commenting on pilot blogs or playing fighter-pilot video games.

Although Malaysian authorities requested that all nations with citizens aboard the flight conduct background checks on them, it wasn't clear how thoroughly the checks were done in Malaysia. The father of a Malaysian aviation engineer aboard the plane said police had not approached anyone in the family about his 29-year-old son, Mohamad Khairul Amri Selamat, though he added that there was no reason to suspect him.

"It is impossible for him to be involved in something like this," said Selamat Omar, 60. "We are keeping our hopes high. I am praying hard that the plane didn't crash and that he will be back soon."

French investigators arriving in Kuala Lumpur to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals. But that vital tool is missing in the Malaysia Airlines mystery because the flight's communications were deliberately silenced ahead of its disappearance, investigators say.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," said Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau.

Malaysia's government sent diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking more planes and ships and asking for any radar data that might help.

The search involves 26 countries and initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

The vast scope of the search was underlined when a U.S. destroyer that already has helped cover 15,000 square miles (38,850 square kilometres) of water dropped out.

The Navy concluded that long-range aircraft were more efficient in looking for the plane or its debris than the USS Kidd and its helicopters, so effective Tuesday the ship was leaving the Indian Ocean search area, said Navy Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the 7th Fleet. Navy P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft remain available, and can cover 15,000 square miles (38,850 square kilometres) in a nine-hour flight.

Over the weekend, Prime Minister Najib Razak said investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 1/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water, with little radar coverage.

Hishammuddin said Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, and that countries from Australia in the south, China in the north and Kazakhstan in the west had joined the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace. Some experts believe it more likely would have gone south, although Malaysian authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that route.

The northern corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan -- all of which have said they have no sign of the plane. China, where two-thirds of the passengers were from, is providing several planes and 21 satellites for the search, Premier Li Keqiang said in a statement.

"Factors involved in the incident continue to multiply, the area of search-and-rescue continues to broaden, and the level of difficulty increases, but as long as there is one thread of hope, we will continue an all-out effort," Li said.

Indonesia focused on Indian Ocean waters west of Sumatra, air force spokesman Rear Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto said.

Australia agreed to Malaysia's request to take the lead in searching the southern Indian Ocean with four Orion maritime planes that would be joined by New Zealand and U.S. aircraft, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.

Comex Gold Falls On Profit-Taking After U.S. Jobs Data

Stronger-than-forecast growth in U.S. employment last month knocked gold futures lower Friday, with the data seen as an excuse by some traders to book profits on long positions. The market focused on the increased number of jobs reported by the Labor Department more-so than a small uptick in the jobless rate itself. Gold for April delivery was down $16.70, or 1.2% on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.##367|Investing.com -

Investing.com - Gold prices edged higher on Monday as the ongoing Russian standoff in Ukraine bolstered the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge, though Friday's strong U.S. jobs report and soft Chinese trade figures watered down gains.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,339.60 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.10%, up from a session low of $1,328.20 and off a high of $1,344.90.

The April contract settled down 1.01% at $1,338.20 on Friday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,320.10 a troy ounce, the low from Feb. 28, and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Monday.

Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices.

Strong U.S. employment numbers and weak Chinese trade figures strengthened the dollar and capped gold's gains, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase.

January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.

The data extended the dollar's gains into Monday, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.

Fed bond purchases, currently set at $65 billion a month, soften the dollar by suppressing interest rates to spur recovery by encouraging investing and hiring.

Weak Chinese trade data supported the greenback as well by bolstering its appeal as a safe-haven asset class.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling and sent investors seeking safety in gold.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 0.55% at US$20.813 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were down 1.30% at US$3.042 a pound.##368|China’s central bank loosened its grip on the yuan on Saturday by doubling the daily trading range for the currency, adding teeth to a promise it would allow market forces to play a greater role in the economy and its markets.

Analysts said the move was a sign of confidence that the central bank had successfully fought off a plague of currency speculators, and at the same time signalled that regulators believe the economy is stable enough to handle more promised reforms going forward.

But as far as Beijing’s project to encourage the international usage of the yuan is concerned, there is less consensus, with some warning that more volatility could discourage firms from using the yuan in the short run.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said the exchange rate will be allowed to rise or fall 2 per cent from a daily midpoint rate it sets each morning. The change is effective from Monday.

“This is a major step towards building more market-oriented exchange rate mechanisms in China, signifying a gradual withdrawal by the central bank from regular intervention in the foreign exchange market,” said Fu Qing, head of foreign exchange trading at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai.

“However, with more volatility in the yuan’s exchange rate created by the reform, Chinese companies will face an uphill task learning how to hedge their currency risks.” Many market participants have long viewed the yuan as a one-way appreciation bet. Authorities are trying to change that by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other.

“The People’s Bank of China will continue to increase the two-way flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate fundamentally stable within reasonable and balanced levels,” the PBOC said in a statement on its website.

A PBOC spokesman in a separate statement said that the new flexibility would help improve efficiency and increase the decisive role of the market to allocate resources.

The widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March. Traders suspected that the central bank, working through state banks, pushed the currency down to try to force those speculating on appreciation to unwind their positions.

The idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened.

The central bank’s clamp down came after it had guided the yuan to rise 2.9 per cent against the dollar in 2013, far outperforming other emerging economy currencies and surprising markets, which had not been so bullish.

That rally encouraged capital to flow betting on a steady increase in Chinese interest rates, which made Chinese assets relatively attractive given the weakness of the dollar.

For all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App##369|London - Gold fell on Monday, under pressure from last week's strong U.S. payrolls data, and after a sharp drop in Chinese exports fuelled heavy selling of commodities by prompting concerns of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

Prices took support, however, from tensions in Ukraine, where concerns over Russia's intervention in Crimea have kept investors on edge.

Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,334.50 an ounce by 1035 GMT, while U.S. gold futures for April delivery fell by $3.20 an ounce to $1,335.00.

The precious metal fell 0.8 percent on Friday after data showed U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs to payrolls, beating forecasts and suggesting the Federal Reserve's stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.

The dollar index bounced off four-month lows in the wake of the data, while U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest in six weeks.

“Clearly gold is battling headwinds coming from the improving U.S. economy, certainly on the jobs front,” Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar said. “We see a close (negative) correlation between gold and the U.S. 10-year yield, which spiked up on Friday, and saw gold at its recent lower levels.”

“There's some risk aversion, though, which should be supportive. I'd expect to see a broad $1,330-1,350 range.”

On the wider markets, commodities sold off after the surprise fall in China's exports, with copper sinking to 8-1/2-month lows, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped.

Asian stocks also fell sharply and the dollar stepped back from its recent highs after the news, although stocks clawed back some lost ground in Europe.

China, the world's biggest consumer of many commodities including gold, said on Saturday that its exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit.

TWO-WAY FLOWS

Chinese prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices on Monday, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of over $20 at the beginning of the year.

Two-way flows were evident in Asian gold trading overnight, MKS said in a report. “Once the Shanghai Gold Exchange opened some aggressive selling ensued, driving the price below $1,330,” it said. “Once again retail bids below this level emerged and supported the market.”

Investor sentiment towards gold has been positive this year after a 28 percent drop in prices in 2013.

Hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to the highest in more than a year, according to Friday data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, said its holdings rose 1.5 tonnes on Friday, its first inflow since Feb. 25.

Among other precious metals, silver was up 0.2 percent at $20.93 an ounce.

The gold/silver ratio, which measures the number of silver ounces needed to buy an ounce of gold, eased back from Friday's one-month high above 64 as silver outperformed.

Spot platinum was down 0.8 percent at $1,465.49 an ounce, while spot palladium was down 1 percent at $771.47 an ounce.

Reuters##370|China’s biggest drop in exports since 2009 and deepening factory-gate deflation highlight the challenges for Premier Li Keqiang in achieving this year’s economic-growth target of 7.5 percent.

Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed Saturday, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report Sunday, extending the longest decline since 1999.

Distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday and false invoices that inflated trade numbers last year, along with a larger-than-projected increase in imports, make it harder to assess the true picture of global and domestic demand for Chinese goods. Slowing consumer-price gains may give leaders more space to support growth if needed as they gauge the effects of the nation’s first onshore corporate-bond default.

“There is an intrinsic inconsistency in their policy target and the reality of the economy,” Liu Li-Gang, head of Greater China economics at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a phone interview. Growth below 7.5 percent in the first half may spur the government to use fiscal stimulus, and “they do have room to do that but by doing so it will compromise China’s economic reform agenda,” he said.

Inflation Target

Premier Li announced the goal for 2014 gross domestic product growth last week at the opening of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, a pace unchanged from last year. He also set a target for consumer inflation of about 3.5 percent this year, the same as in 2013, and a goal of 7.5 percent for growth in foreign trade.

The consumer price index rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, a 13-month low, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Sunday.

China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which last week had its first gain in three weeks, has dropped about 11 percent in the past year. The yuan posted its largest weekly increase since October, following the biggest monthly decline since the government unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.

The yuan’s 1.4 percent drop in February may have helped spur the disappearance of over-invoicing, a practice used to disguise capital inflows that plagued trade data in the first four months of last year. Under-invoicing of exports may have occurred in the second half of February to facilitate money outflows, Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Hong Kong, said in a note.

Complicate Plans

Imports rose 10.1 percent in February from a year earlier, more than projected, leaving a trade deficit of $23 billion, the biggest in two years, according to customs data.

Any weakening of global demand as well as falling prices for manufacturers may complicate plans by Li and President Xi Jinping to carry out the broadest economic-policy shifts since the 1990s while clamping down on debt risks and pollution.

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co., a maker of solar cells, on Friday became the first company to default in China’s onshore bond market after failing to pay full interest due.

The coal industry in northern Shanxi province suffered gravely because of a slump in prices last year, Governor Li Xiaopeng said March 6 in Beijing.

Beverage Sales

In a more positive sign, growth this year at Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co., the largest Chinese beverage maker, is “not too bad” and sales are likely to increase about 20 percent, Chairman Zong Qinghou said Sunday at the NPC meeting.

Customs data showed overseas shipments fell 1.6 percent in the first two months from a year earlier. China’s exports to Hong Kong, which diverged last year from the city’s data on imports from the mainland, fell 21 percent, compared with a 61 percent increase in the January-February period of 2013. Chinese regulators in May started a crackdown on practices that inflated trade data.

Economists from UBS AG, RBS and Bank of America Corp. estimate exports for January and February combined did expand after taking into account inflated data last year.

UBS sees underlying export growth of about 6 percent, while RBS estimates 3.1 percent and Bank of America put the figure at around 7 percent to 8 percent.

Disappointments Possible

“In terms of the underlying momentum, we expect export growth in 2014 to continue to develop favorably,” wrote RBS’s Kuijs, a former World Bank economist. At the same time, the “global recovery is not a steep one and disappointments are possible,” he said.

Investors this week will get more details on the economy’s performance as well as the outlook from senior leaders. The statistics bureau will provide data on January-February industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment on March 13. The central bank will publish figures for February credit and money supply by March 15.

People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan will give a briefing on March 11 and Premier Li will hold a press conference on March 13.

Subdued inflation below the government’s 2014 target will give the central bank more room to ease liquidity and maintain lower money-market interest rates, said Lu Ting, head of Greater China economics at Bank of America in Hong Kong.

China’s seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding availability in the banking system, averaged 3 percent last week, down from 4.98 percent at the end of January.

“The low CPI inflation could be good news for markets as monetary tightening is definitely not justified,” Lu said in a note Sunday. “Lower and more stable interbank rates should be supportive of delivering a stable GDP growth.”##371|* Housing starts fall 0.2 percent in February

* Permits rise 7.7 percent, but single permits fall

* Consumer price index up 0.1 percent, but food prices jump

By Lucia Mutikani

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. inflation was muted in February and housing starts fell for a third straight month, giving the Federal Reserve plenty of room to keep interest rates low even as it scales back the amount of money it is pumping into the economy.

The data, which came as the Fed opened a two-day policy meeting, painted a picture of sluggish economic growth in the first quarter as unseasonably cold weather disrupted activity. A jump in building permits last month, however, also offered cautious optimism for an acceleration once the weather warms up.

“The economy is not too hot and not too cold. Winter was a difficult season for housing and there are no signs that inflation is about to pick up in a meaningful way,” said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index nudged up 0.1 percent for the second month in a row as a drop in gasoline prices offset the largest rise in the cost of food in nearly 2-1/2 years.

In the 12 months through February, consumer prices were up only 1.1 percent, slowing from a 1.6 percent rise in January. The February increase was the smallest in four months.

Stripping out the volatile energy and food components, the so-called core CPI rose 0.1 percent for a third straight month. Its 12-month gain held steady at 1.6 percent.

The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and it tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI. With inflation falling short of their target, Fed officials are likely to bide their time before raising benchmark overnight rates from zero.

Nevertheless, they have indicated they will press forward with plans to wind down a separate bond-buying stimulus program.

“There isn’t much to suggest inflation is about to make a move to the upside or downside,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “This should allow the Fed to remain growth-friendly.”

Fed officials are expected to announce another $10 billion cut to their monthly bond-buying program when their meeting concludes on Wednesday.

Separately, a quarterly survey by the Business Roundtable found U.S. chief executive officers somewhat more positive about the economy, including plans for hiring and capital spending over the next six months, although they expect only tepid growth this year.

When asked in a conference call if the CEOs felt they had pricing power, AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson said they were not surveyed about pricing but added that he thought most were experiencing “kind of a low inflation environment.”

“We have all built our business plans around continued low inflationary expectations,” said Stephenson, who is also chairman of the Business Roundtable.

DROUGHT FACTOR

A drought in the western United States likely accounted for the 0.4 percent rise in food prices last month, the largest advance since September 2011. There were big increases in the prices for meat, fish, poultry, eggs, vegetables and fruits.

Within the core CPI, a 0.2 percent gain in the cost of shelter was the major contributor to the rise in the index. There were also increases in medical care, recreation and new vehicle prices. But prices for tobacco, used cars and trucks, apparel and household furnishings and operations fell.

In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 907,000 units in February. Groundbreaking declined 11.2 percent in January.

Severe winter weather likely constrained building activity last month, with starts in the Northeast region plunging 37.5 percent. However, there were huge increases in the Midwest and South.

Housing lost momentum after a run-up in mortgage rates last summer. High prices and a lack of properties on the market are also holding back buying activity.

“We are probably due for a bounce in the coming months as the weather normalizes, but questions linger about the underlying pace of starts once the catch-up period is over,” said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.

Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.3 percent last month. Starts for the volatile multi-family homes segment fell 1.2 percent.

Permits to build homes increased 7.7 percent to a 1.02 million-unit pace, ending three straight months of declines. Permits for single-family homes, however, fell 1.8 percent, while those for multifamily units surged 24.3 percent.

“The gap between starts and permits is widening and since builders don’t pay the money for permits unless they expect to do something with them, you can bet that once the warm weather returns, so will the bulldozers,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.##372|##373|Empty##374|We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

The multinational corporation is calling for its customers to voluntarily pay a 50 cents ObamaCare tip for each tall mocha latte they purchase. According to the Houston Chronicle, "Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which raises the question — how often do people tip their baristas? The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company's app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device." However, some customers are complaining. They argue that Starbucks is already too expensive and to pay an added 50 cents ObamaCare tip would be a burden in the Obama Recession Era. As reported by the Houston Chronicle, "The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don't earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn't be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well." Starbucks only intends to request the 50 cents ObamaCare tips at its coffee shops located in the United States.

Even more surprising to the media was that Obamacare turned out to be the winning issue for Republicans.

The Democratic congressional candidate outspent the Republican by a million dollars, and it was a district that President Barack Obama carried in 2012. But the Democratic candidate's message about Obamacare, "fix, don't repeal" and "mend, don't amend," was a loser because the American people want Obamacare repealed.

The Democrats had thought Obama's favorite legislation would be a political advantage by now. It would have given health insurance to millions of voters who never had it before, others would enjoy subsidies and free contraceptives, and all had confidence in Obama's promise, "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" (and your health insurance plan and your hospital).

It must have been a rude awakening for many liberals to realize that it was all a lie, and you really can't keep your doctor or your insurance plan. Liberals now have to face the fact that not only Obama made a false promise, but that he and his staff knew it was a lie when they wrote it on his teleprompter.

Millions of Americans have had their health insurance canceled. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.

Nancy Pelosi told members of Congress they had to pass Obamacare so we can all find out what's in it. We are finding out more and more things we don't like about it every day.

Obama's game plan to dodge the Obamacare bullet is to announce an exemption or a waiver or a deadline change almost every week. The purpose seems to be to postpone as many obnoxious deadlines as possible so that they do not take effect until after this year's November election.

The scholar Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute reports that the administration has made 37 significant changes to Obamacare, of which at least 20 were made unilaterally by Obama with his famous "pen."

Only 15 were made legally by Congress.

Obamacare is a disaster any way you look at it. It violates the Constitution by forcing individual Americans to buy things we don't need or want, and to pay for other people to buy products we don't approve of.

So what do we have to show for the high cost of Obamacare? Lost jobs, full-time jobs cut to part-time jobs, canceled health insurance policies, higher premiums for health insurance, a website that doesn't work (so people don't know if they are signed up or not), and navigators, who couldn't pass a background check, to help us navigate the website.

Obamacare was designed to conceal its extraordinary cost by depending on healthy young people signing up to compensate the insurance companies for the high costs of unhealthy seniors. And we've just discovered a previously unnoticed fine-print provision to require taxpayers to bail out the insurance companies if they lose money on that deal.

The Obama administration is trying to save face by claiming that Obamacare's only problems are with the website and implementation. In fact, the real problem is the socialist mindset that the government can take over a sixth of our economy and do it better and cheaper, and that's ridiculous because higher taxes, more inconvenience and lots of bailouts are what prevail.

The big government takeover of an entire industry is driving up health care costs, imposing new taxes, increasing our national debt, encouraging Obama to function like a dictator by unilaterally changing the law, and destroying our once-great health care system.

The administration claims that 4.2 million people have signed up, which is a lot fewer than the original 7 million goal. But the real joker is that many of these people haven't paid their first premium. Like shopping at the supermarket, they've put some items in their cart, but they haven't yet paid at the checkout counter, so we don't know the real numbers.

But we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance. The Associated Press reported that at least 4.7 million Americans received notices that their current health insurance policies were canceled, and that's more than the 4.2 million who have signed up.

Most of Obama's changes were to help 2014 Democratic candidates, who are running away from Obamacare faster than they are running for office. The solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.

King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game "Candy Crush Saga", expects to be worth up to $US7.6 billion ($A8.5 billion) when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $US17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

"Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.

Dublin-based King said overnight it expects to price its IPO at $US21-$US24 per share, valuing it at up to $US7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realise a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fuelled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

"I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a scepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 per cent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

Another Zynga?

"Candy Crush" launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".

Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $US602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $US22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fuelled by "Candy Crush" rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $US17 billion this year from just $US6 billion in 2010.

Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of "Farmville" waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of "Angry Birds".

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $US527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined three percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in "Candy Crush" gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga". About 73 per cent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

"The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."

NYSE debut

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $US532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 per cent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.##385|

The Associated Press





DETROIT -- General Motors' executives and government regulators will soon have to explain to Congress why it took years to recall 1.6 million compact cars with a known defect linked to 13 deaths. And the Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response, according to a person briefed on the matter.

Members of two congressional committees will likely ask why a proposed fix to the problem was never implemented and why GM didn't immediately tell car owners about the defect. Here's a look at the developments so far in the recall and what's ahead.

Q. Which cars is GM recalling?

A. GM is recalling a total of 1.6 million vehicles that were sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The recall includes the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 from the 2005-2007 model years; the Saturn Ion from the 2003-2007 model years; and the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky from the 2006-2007 model years.

Q. What's the defect?

A. GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags.

Q. What is GM doing to fix the problem?

A. Dealers will replace the ignition switches for free. GM will notify owners when the parts are available and repairs can begin, likely in April. Until then, it is warning owners to remove all items from their key rings, including key fobs if applicable. Only the vehicle key should be left on the ring.

Q. Have any deaths or accidents been linked to this defect?

A. The problem has been linked to 31 crashes and 13 front-seat deaths. In each of the fatal crashes, the air bags did not inflate. The engines did not shut off in all cases.

Q. When did GM first know about this problem?

In 2004, around the time that the Chevrolet Cobalt first went on sale, GM learned of at least one engine losing power and started investigating the problem. By 2007, it had received more reports, including at least one involving a fatal accident. According to a company timeline that was given to NHTSA, the company approved a redesign of the key head in 2005 but later cancelled that plan. The company also alerted dealers that an insert on the key head could fix the problem, but warranty records show only 474 customers have gotten the insert.

Q. Why didn't GM act more quickly?

A. GM opened at least two investigations after reports of engine stalling but closed them after taking no action. At the time, the company was juggling eight U.S. brands and losing billions each year, which led to its eventual bankruptcy in 2009. Now, GM has cut excess brands and bureaucracy and is solidly profitable. GM's new CEO has promised "an unvarnished" investigation into what happened.

Q. Did GM report these incidents to the government?

A. Yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also received dozens of complaints from owners about the issue, dating as far back as 2005. NHTSA conducted several investigations into the problem but never ordered a recall.

Q. Why is Congress investigating?

A. Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote a 2000 law that was intended to improve communication between automakers and NHTSA and help NHTSA identify potential threats to consumers' safety. He wants to know if GM or NHTSA missed opportunities to fix the problem sooner, or if the legislation needs to be strengthened.

Q. What actions can the government take if it finds GM didn't act quickly enough?

A. NHTSA can fine GM up to $35 million. Automakers are required to report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them. Congress doubled the maximum fine to $35 million last year and could increase it further.

Q. What's at stake for GM?

A. It's unclear how much the recall will cost. Toyota Motor Corp. paid $48.8 million in total fines to the U.S. government for its handling of unintended acceleration recalls. It later paid more than $1 billion to settle a lawsuit from owners claiming their cars lost value. It still faces other lawsuits.

The case will also hurt GM's efforts to break from its pre-bankruptcy past. Older, less reliable products still on the road could still haunt GM.

Q. Where can I get more information?

Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000. They may also contact NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or go to www.safercar.gov.##386|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets slumped while bonds rallied on Thursday as tensions between Russia and the West increased over Ukraine and concerns about a Chinese economic slowdown rose.

Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday and showed no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea, despite a stronger than expected drive for sanctions from the EU and United States.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of “catastrophe” unless Russia changed course. U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, said the U.S. and the E.U. would take serious steps against Russia if a referendum on Ukraine’s Crimea region goes ahead as planned on Sunday.

Earlier in the day Chinese Premier Li Keqiang warned that the economy faces “severe challenges” in 2014, after weak data fanned speculation the central bank would relax monetary policy to support stuttering growth.

Benchmark U.S. stock indices fell more than 1.0 percent, posting their biggest daily losses since early February, while longer dated U.S. Treasuries prices rallied to their highest levels in over a week.

“People are increasing the probability that there may be more of a conflict (in Ukraine) than was thought before,” said Priya Misra, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

While investors nervously monitored the crisis in Ukraine, their appetite for riskier assets was also diminished by fears of slowing economic growth in China.

Growth in China’s industrial output came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries growth there could slow as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 231.19 points or 1.41 percent, to 16,108.89. The S&P500 stock index lost 21.86 points or 1.17 percent, to 1,846.34, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 62.912 points or 1.46 percent, to 4,260.42.

The MSCI global stock market index was down 0.8 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 ended down 1.1 percent. Russia’s RTS stock index, ended down 2.0 percent, falling to its lowest since September 2009.

The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note last traded up 19/32 in price to yield 2.658 percent.

SAFE-HAVEN YEN, GOLD GAIN

At the same time, the Japanese yen climbed 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollar at 101.66 yen after hitting a one-week high at 101.56 in late U.S. trading. It gained 1.4 percent versus the euro to one-week peaks, last at 140.90 yen..

The euro weakened against the dollar, ending 0.3 percent lower at $1.3858. Earlier, gains propelled the common currency to a 2-1/2-year high against the greenback at $1.3967.

Comments from the European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi,

signalling he remained open to more action to avert deflation, pressured the euro.

Gold rose to a six-month high on worries over Chinese economic growth and recent corporate bond defaults, as well as Russia’s standoff with Ukraine over Crimea. Spot gold was up 0.4 percent at $1,371.74 an ounce

“Amid concerns about the Chinese economy and the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, gold is clearly still in demand as a safe haven,” said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at Commerzbank.

COPPER AND BRENT CRUDE OIL DECLINE

Copper prices resumed their decline on Thursday as concerns about the economy of top consumer China intensified following data showing weak industrial output and retail sales.

With demand for the metal seen falling as Chinese economic growth slows, copper prices have fallen more than 8.0 percent since Friday and are down 12 percent for the year.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) closed at $6,415 from $6,505 on Wednesday.

“The (Chinese) industrial production data has further reinforced the concerns that the threat is becoming more real and the recent policies by the PBOC are failing to rebalance their economy,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade, referring to the Chinese central bank.

In the energy market, Brent crude oil prices fell as the weak data from China overshadowed worries about the stand-off between Russia and Western powers over Ukraine.

The conflict has provided global oil markets support in recent weeks because traders worry it could lead to a disruption of oil supplies from Russia, one of the world’s largest oil producers.

Brent crude fell 63 cents to settle at $107.39 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures rose 21 cents to settle at $98.20.##387|This will appear next to all of your comments

J.C. Penney rallied 6.3 percent after Citigroup raised its recommendation on the retail chain. Urban Outfitters dropped 6 percent after saying it remains cautious about its performance in the first quarter.

The S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent to 1,876.83 at 9:43 a.m. in New York. The benchmark index closed at an all-time on March 7. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.52 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 16,413.16 today. Trading in S&P 500 stocks was 27 percent below the 30-day average at this time of day.

“The equity market is going to make continued progress in a two steps forward, one step back kind of progression,” Jim Russell, who helps oversee $115 billion as a senior equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said by phone. “We’re still evaluating how much of the economic weakness is weather related and how much of it is legitimate. We’re hopeful that much of the weakness we’ve seen is weather related and that we’ll get a snapback in the second quarter.”

The S&P 500 rallied 4.3 percent in February after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the economy was strong enough to withstand measured reductions to the central bank’s monthly bond purchases. Three rounds of Fed stimulus have helped push the S&P 500 up 177 percent from a 12-year low, as U.S. equities begin the sixth year of a bull market that started March 9, 2009.

Economic Data

U.S. employers added more workers than estimated in February, a Labor Department report showed last week. Other reports indicated manufacturing expanded faster than projected last month, while consumer spending rose more than estimated in January.

The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent yesterday as a report showed Chinese exports unexpectedly slumped last month and Ukraine began military drills.

Russia is wresting control of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, home to its Black Sea Fleet, sparking the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War. The European Union told Russia it must switch course in Crimea by next week or risk more sanctions as Ukraine’s deposed president warned of a possible civil war.

Ukraine’s Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said today the country may mobilize 20,000 people to protect its borders. Ukraine says Russia has almost 19,000 soldiers in Crimea, which holds a referendum on March 16 on whether to secede.

J.C. Penney

J.C. Penney jumped 6.3 percent to $8.95 after Citigroup upgraded the shares to buy from neutral, saying the company will meet its revenue and margin forecasts this year. The retailer predicted on Feb. 26 that gross margin will improve and same- store sales will increase by a mid-single digit percentage this year.

FuelCell Energy Inc. rallied 17 percent to $4.59. First-quarter revenue of $44.4 million exceeded the $42.3 million estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Shares of the fuel- cell manufacturer have more than doubled this month.

Urban Outfitters slipped 6 percent to $35.27. Chief Executive Officer Richard Hayne said he expects poor weather to contribute to lower sales and profit margins in the first quarter for its Urban Outfitters-branded shops. The clothing retailer also reported earnings of 59 cents a share for the fourth quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 54 cents.

MORE BUSINESS NEWS##390|The European Union has said it is halting visa talks with Russia following an emergency summit of the bloc's leaders where they discussed ways to punish Russia for its recent exploits on the Crimean Peninsula. If Russia continues to reject negotiations, further measures are to be taken, which could entail economic sanctions.

It didn't take long for the Kremlin to respond. Any sanction will be met with countermeasures from Moscow, an official government statement declared. The United States has already imposed visa bans on targeted Russians and warned of freezing their assets. In response, Russia has threatened to stop reciprocal weapons inspections.

The chimes of boycotts flashin'

According to news magazine Der Spiegel, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her attendance at the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi depends on developments in Crimea. If the Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia, which Merkel has openly called "illegal" and in "violation of Ukraine's constitution," goes ahead, the chancellor won't be in Sochi in June.

Emergency summits have thus far produced only watered down sanctions

Michael Fuchs, conservative politician and deputy parliamentary head of Merkel's CDU, has suggested another form of sanction to force Putin's hand: take away, or at least call into question, Russia's hosting of the 2018 Soccer World Cup. That suggestion has been criticized by left-leaning Social Democrat and Left Party politicians as "soccer diplomacy."

But calls for some kind of sanctions are growing ever louder; at the same time, criticism is also reverberating that this form of conflict resolution is simply wrong. Even EU Parliament President Martin Schulz, himself a German Social Democrat, has expressed doubt as to whether such words will ultimately bring Putin to the negotiating table.

Watered down sanctions?

Be that as it may, the sanctions that have been addressed are seen by many as rather mild. In a commentary in the Swiss daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung, one journalist remarked that the proposed measures are weaker than those hurled at Switzerland following its referendum on capping immigration.

Some German politicians have said that any sanctions at all would miss the mark, resulting merely in further dividing the two sides. Gregor Gysi, parliamentary head of the Left Party, rejects imposing sanctions against Russia altogether: "You can perhaps impress a weak partner with sanctions, but not Russia. It has China on its side, and we must not underestimate this," Gysi told German public radio.

Martin Wansleben is happy about Germany's careful course

"Such a situation lends itself to saber rattling, and as soon as we shout 'sanctions' then Putin will make his own threat," Gysi added, pointing out that the EU should also keep in mind its dependency on Russian gas.

The EU's careful stance on the accelerating Ukraine crisis has garnered praise from German economic representatives. "It's quite right to promote de-escalation," said Martin Wansleben, head of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

"We are communicating not only with Putin but with all of Russia," he added. "I think it's smart to say that we're in a position to talk, but at the end of the day we are willing to compromise." Wansleben also pointed out that the dive taken by the rouble since the outbreak of the crisis can be seen as an indirect effect of the sanctions already pledged.

Close economic ties

Economic sanctions would be senseless for Germany, because they would endanger billions in investments. Trade volumes between Germany and Russia in 2013 were over 75 billion euros ($104 billion). Around 6,000 German companies currently do business in Russia, and around 300,000 jobs could be jeopardized. And then there is the financial sector: European banks have around 180 billion euros in Russia at the moment.

Germany currently gets 35 percent of its oil and gas imports from Russia

EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger's concerns of a potential escalation between Russia and Europe are perhaps the most acute. Sanctions, he said, "would negatively affect Europe's fragile economic renewal," adding that Europe needed to find alternatives to Russian gas. As far as Germany's transition to renewable energy is concerned, Oettinger said it would be impossible without Russian gas. At the moment, Germany receives 35 percent of its oil and gas imports from Russia.

Germany is divided as to whether the West should impose sanctions on Russia. A recent Emnid survey indicates that 45 percent of Germans are against the sanctions, with 44 percent in support. The results were significantly different when the question was put differently: 54 percent of Germans said they wouldn't be willing to help Ukraine if sanctions led to higher gas bills.##391|Empty##392|Empty##393|Talk to a domain expert: 1-303-893-0552

Developments in China and Ukraine are likely the driving forces.

While China's first domestic bond default sank the copper market on Tuesday, it may have boosted gold on Wednesday as signs of unstable financial conditions pushed some investors to wealth-preserving bullion.

Things are also heating up again in Ukraine. A referendum on Crimea's separation is scheduled for Sunday and the country's security council chief has accused Russia of a "massive military buildup" at its borders.

The EU, Canada, Japan, Turkey, and the US have threatened Russia with coordinated sanctions.

March 11 (Reuters) - One of the top executives of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has raised questions about Comcast’s potential dominance of the U.S. broadband Internet market if regulators allow its $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable to be completed.

Speaking at an investor conference on Tuesday, Chase Carey, Fox president and chief operating officer, said the “broadband issue” will be front and center when U.S. regulators review the tie-up that merges the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators.

Asked about concerns over the merger, Carey said, “Probably the issue that will come out of it, and that will ultimately get focused on, is really the broadband issue. Is there choice in broadband? Are you really headed toward every home having simply one broadband provider, and what are the implications of that?”

If its bid for Time Warner Cable is approved, Comcast would be the Internet provider to about 40 percent of U.S. households paying for high-speed Internet access, analysts estimate.

As TV service becomes more personalized with new navigation tools and targeted advertising, broadband infrastructure, and who controls that service, will become even more critical, Carey said. There has not been any pushback so far from companies against the deal, he added.

“We haven’t seen any filings yet and how does that get addressed? I assume there will be aspects of that that are addressed,” he said.

“Potentially, you may have for most of the country, simply one wired broadband pipe and again that’s the piece that will get, at the end of the day, most focused on,” he said.

Comcast did not respond to a request for comment.

Also at the same conference, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes predicted a government role in bolstering post-merger competition.

“In the longer run there are some questions on competition that any deal like this will look at, the government will look at and make sure the appropriate conditions are in place to optimize competition,” Bewkes said.

DirecTV’s CEO Mike White, who was already called for regulatory scrutiny of the deal, said on Tuesday, that the government will likely focus on “all the aspects of Internet, from net neutrality to you name it.”

He also said the government should consider whether Comcast is a national business instead of a local one which “requires the government to take a different perspective.”

Once Comcast files its merger documents with regulators, the Justice Department and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission will both take months to review the merger’s impact on competition, focusing on antitrust and public interest concerns respectively.##401|iNVEZZ.com, Monday, March 17: Vodafone Group Plc (LON:VOD) has agreed to buy Spain’s largest cable company Ono for €7.2 billion (£6 billion), including debt. The price tag implies a multiple of 10.4 times Ono's operating free cash flow, broadly in line with recent deals in the European cable and telecoms sector.

The world’s second largest mobile phone company announced the move in a statement to the London Stock Exchange earlier this morning. In today’s trading Vodafone shares were up 1.1 percent at 224.60p as of 9:16 UTC

Highly attractive

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone,” Vodafone chief executive officer Vittorio Colao commented in today’s statement.

“We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain," he added.

Meanwhile, Ono chairman José María Castellano Ríos commented that the deal reflected his company’s attractive position as “Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications”.

Vodafone expects to see significant benefits from the acquisition. The UK company pointed out that Ono is a highly attractive standalone business and has the largest next-generation network in Spain, which covers 7.2 million homes across 13 of the country’s 17 regions. It offers fixed and mobile communications and television services to approximately 1.9 million customers. Ono’s network provides broadband speeds of up to 200 Mb per second, significantly faster than competing cable companies in the country.

Last year Ono reported revenue of €1.6 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €680 million.

Ono’s acquisition is also expected to provide a significant boost to Vodafone’s ‘unified communications strategy’ in an important European market. The deal will allow the UK telecoms giant to take advantage on the rapid increase in adoption of unified communications products and services in Spain. The company also sees significant potential to accelerate growth by leveraging its extensive distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base.

European assets

The Ono deal represents a continuation of Vodafone’s push to rebuild its European operations. Last year the company secured the acquisition of Germany’s largest cable company, Kabel Deutschland, in a €7.5 billion deal. The British company said on Friday that the integration of its existing operations in Germany and Kabel would begin from April 1.

Deep-pocketed Vodafone has indicated that it plans to spend £25 billion of the £84 billion it generated from the sale of its stake in US company, Verizon Wireless, to invest in its core European networks.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - U.S. special forces have seized a tanker that fled with a cargo of oil from a Libyan port controlled by anti-government rebels, halting their attempt to sell crude on the global market.

Gunmen demanding regional autonomy and a share of oil wealth had managed to load the ship, which escaped Libya's navy and triggered a crisis that prompted parliament to sack the prime minister.

A U.S. SEAL commando team boarded the tanker Morning Glory from a Naval special warfare rigid inflatable boat as it sat in international waters off Cyprus on Sunday night.

The seizure was approved by U.S. President Barack Obama and requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

No one was hurt in the under two hour operation, and no shots fired. Two AK47 rifles were found and the three Libyans holding the ship remained in U.S. control, a U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained" from the Libyan port of Es Sider, Kirby's statement said.

The standoff over Libyan oil and the tanker debacle have deepened the chaos testing Tripoli since the civil war that toppled Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.

With its army still nascent, a weak government has been unable to impose its will on former anti-Gaddafi fighters and militias who now use their military muscle to make demands on the state, often by targeting the vital oil sector.

At least in the short term, the tanker's seizure by U.S. forces is likely to prevent any more attempted oil sales by the rebels, who in August took control of three export terminals accounting previously for 700,000 barrels a day of exports.

"Oil is the economy's artery. The government will not allow anyone to fool around with the assets and resources of the Libyan people," the Libyan government said in a statement.

It was the second time in six months that U.S. forces have become involved in Libya. A commando team snatched a suspected al Qaeda suspect off the street as he returned home from prayers in the capital Tripoli in September.

The Cypriot foreign ministry said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a U.S. military escort.

An American crew from the USS Stout, a guided missile destroyer, got the tanker underway toward Libya on Monday. The Stout voyage was expected to take up to four days, the officials said.

The Morning Glory had been North Korean-flagged, but the government in Pyongyang on Thursday said it had notified Libya and maritime authorities that it had severed all ties with the ship because of the vessel's contraband cargo.

So Se Pyong, North Korea's ambassador in Geneva, said on Monday he discussed the situation with his Libyan counterpart to explain, but not apologize for the situation.

He said North Korea did not buy oil from Libyan rebels, and since the Egyptian-based shipping firm had acting illegally he was not concerned about the U.S. Navy seizure.

"Whether it was captured by the Americans, or by someone else, if that ship was doing something wrong, then we don't care," So told Reuters.

There was no immediate reaction from the federalist rebels, based in eastern Libya.

Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said on Saturday his group was ready to negotiate an end to the port blockade, but the government needed to abandon plans to mount a military offensive.

But analysts said it was uncertain whether government troops would be able effectively to confront the heavily armed rebels, made up of soldiers who defected from an oil protection force.

LEAR JET TO CYPRUS

The tanker's escape highlighted the weakness of government forces, which had claimed several times that the 37,000-tonne ship was under their control only for the vessel to slip into international waters after a firefight.

Still, the intervention gives a boost to the fragile Libyan government in its fight to impose order. The transition to democracy has been upset by tribal, regional and political disputes.

Western powers, worried that it might fracture or slide deeper into chaos, have been training Libyan armed forces and cajoling conflicting parties in government to reach a settlement, with little progress.

A successful sale of Libyan oil outside government control, though, was always going to be complicated for the rebels.

A Cypriot police source said three men - described as two Israelis and a Senegalese - were detained for questioning on Saturday on suspicion of attempting to buy the tanker's cargo, but were freed after a court refused to issue an arrest warrant.

Two of the men carried diplomatic passports - one from Senegal and one from a central African country, the security source said.

The source said they flew a Lear Jet into Cyprus on Friday evening, chartered a vessel from a yachting marina in Larnaca and headed to the tanker.

"They spoke to somebody on board the vessel, then left. At Larnaca marina police called them in for questioning," the source said. The men left for Tel Aviv after being freed.

The Libyan navy opened fire on a Maltese-flagged tanker trying to approach Es Sider in January, but analysts say a full military confrontation with the port rebels would be unlikely.

The government fears federalism might open the door for secession and similar protests by other regions, though the rebels say they do not want to break up Libya.

Tripoli faces a budget crisis as oil production has fallen to a little over 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 1.4 million bpd in summer when protests at oilfields and ports started.

(Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images)

The Federal Reserve gets a lot of credit for what passes as an economic recovery. Whether it deserves that credit, going forward the Fed has very little power to influence events because it is essentially out of ammo to further ease. The economy, meanwhile, is still lackluster, despite the central bank's unjustified optimism.

The Fed cast a warm and fuzzy glow in January, when it predicted a pickup in economic growth, which it cited as its rationale for tapering its bond buying campaign, called quantitative easing (QE). And if that acceleration doesn't happen in the near future?

Don't worry: Wall Street will just shift its predictions for a growth resurgence to the second half of the year, as it's done every year since about 2005 -- if memory serves correctly. At this time of year, the Street always says that things will get better in the second half.

The revision of fourth-quarter 2013 gross domestic product growth of 2.8% is not enough of a reason to reverse the Fed's QE policy, which seems to have less and less effect on the real economy, according to the central bank's own research. The Fed says it will gradually taper its monthly bond buying, most likely ending it altogether late in the year. But the Fed's new chief,Janet Yellen, adds that it reserves the right to change course and increase the purchases if the economy dips.

If the current first quarter does end up with say, 1.5% GDP growth, the bad weather in much of the nation will be a factor. But the weather effect is still amorphous enough not to reverse course. Once winter fades, there will inevitably be a rebound effect, so the bank may have to wait until the third quarter before it feels comfortable saying anything about the true core rate of growth (although it probably will cut its 2014 forecast by the June meeting).

Keep in mind that the only easing tools the Fed has left are forward guidance – its practice, through issuing forecasts of its policy intentions, of influencing market behavior – and more QE. It can't run about ramping up money printing for every bump in the road. Its bond purchases succeeded in raising asset prices by progressively upping the ante each time; that option isn't available anymore, not when the price tag is the Fed's bloated balance sheet already on its way to $5 trillion. Also, 2014 is a mid-term election year, and I suspect that the Fed governors would really like to be out of the program entirely come November.

Finally, as dovish as Yellen and the others may want to be, there are a couple of realities confronting the bank. One is the lack of ammunition for any crisis that might pop up before the current QE program is back to zero again. QE is partly a psychological effect, and backing out of tapering it in mid-stream is likely to induce considerable anxiety after the initial euphoria wears off.

The other is the nature of the Fed's charter. Quantitative easing was predicated from the beginning on improving employment, a goal handed to the bank in the 1970s by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. The unemployment rate, now 6.6%, is unlikely to rise anytime soon, given that unemployment is a lagging indicator. So far as the business cycle goes, it is one of the last parts to decline. A resumption of QE after a weak GDP report and a Fed prediction that unemployment might worsen would be politically lethal - the central bank is only as independent as Congress says it is.

The economy hasn't shown any signs whatsoever of accelerating to a sustained 3% growth rate. The recovery from the Great Recession has been choppy, with one quarter's surge followed by a weaker performance. Fourth-quarter 2012 growth slipped to a mere 0.1%, for example. Temporary growth surges sometimes occur, due to sporadic influences like the inventory-restocking episode from last year, when this sudden and unexpected increase helped propel the third-quarter gain to 4.1%.

I couldn't believe my ears on Thursday when I saw a fellow on CNBC say with a straight face "well, the economy really is getting better this year." The economy is only getting better on the same basis it's gotten better the last five years - somewhere over the rainbow.

The current stock market rebound is getting stretched: The Standard & Poor's 500 has nearly reclaimed its January peak, while the Nasdaq is making new post-2000 highs. All of that in spite of some pretty weak data recently, such as the housing sector's downbeat results. The National Association of Realtors says January existing home sales slumped 5.1%, which it ascribed to poor weather, and rising home prices and mortgage rates.

That said, equities could still squeak out mild gains ahead, after a breather here and there. I've talked about a first-quarter top for stocks since the beginning of the year, and my prediction is still intact. But it still appears to me to be a top to sell, not to buy.

(NYSE: GM) will not face any legal liability for many of the 13 deaths caused by an ignition defect in 1.4 million cars built between 2003 and 2007, that will not keep the sellers on Wall Street from going after the stock. In fact, if the stock breaks the $35 support line that goes back to June of last year, there is no telling where it could trade to.

The iconic Detroit car company announced in February the recall of vehicles with the ignition defect. The bad news for GM shareholders is the company allegedly knew about the defect for nearly 10 years. While GM CEO Mary Barra, in a recent letter to GM employees, said “We will hold ourselves accountable” for the problems that led to the recall, that will not stop short sellers from targeting the stock. In fact, event-driven hedge funds may be continuing to sell the stock short on the hopes that the current gruesome headlines only get worse.

The saving grace, if there is one in such a bad corporate situation, is that GM, along with Chrysler, received a shield from legal liability lawsuits in 2009 as part of the bankruptcy filing and government bailout. That may look good on paper, but it will not help when the sellers start to dominate the buyers.

A GM spokesperson tried to put the best corporate spin on what could be a very difficult situation going forward, especially if the government decides there has been a cover-up of sorts and decides to file criminal charges against the company. GM’s Greg Martin said:

GM is focused on ensuring the safety and peace of mind of our customers involved in the recall. … It is true that new GM did not assume liability for claims arising from incidents or accidents occurring prior to July 2009. Our principle throughout this process has been to put the customer first, and that will continue to guide us.

Investors holding the stock now are faced with two choices. Sell and see if the situation resolves in some form in the future. Hold the stock and hope that the government does not find any sort of conspiracy and go after the company. Either way, shareholders are in for a rocky ride. We will keep a close eye on the situation and continue to update our readers.##415|Empty##416|Empty##417|Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein shows the map of northern search corridor during a press conference at a hotel next to the Kuala Lumpur. Photo- AP

Kuala Lumpur: The search for the missing Malaysian jet pushed deep into the northern and southern hemispheres on Monday as Australia took the lead in scouring the seas of the southern Indian Ocean and Kazakhstan - about 10,000 miles to the northwest - answered Malaysia's call for help in the unprecedented hunt.

French investigators arriving to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals - but investigators say the Malaysian airliner's communications links were deliberately severed ahead of its mysterious disappearance more than a week ago.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.

Malaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots' home on March 9, the day after the flight.

Investigators haven't ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight's last words - "All right, good night" - to ground controllers.

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots - or someone else - without the other pilot's knowledge.

Malaysia's government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

Over the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 ? hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.

The northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan - all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.

An official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to questions on radar information.

Indonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country's search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the "ill-fated aircraft" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia's leader.

"Australia will do its duty in this matter," Abbott told parliament. "We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."

Australia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.##418|China's central bank has decided to double the daily trading band for the yuan against the US dollar from tomorrow, marking a step forward in giving the currency more flexibility.

The People's Bank of China will allow the exchange rate to float by as much as 2 per cent up or down from a midpoint set by the central bank each day. The band has been kept at 1 per cent since 2012.

The central bank, however, vowed to step in as needed to stem any large swings.

Market players have widely expected the change after the central bank guided the yuan to weaken 1.6 per cent against the US dollar since the start of this year, reversing a 2.9 per cent climb in 2013.

"It's another step made by Beijing towards a free-floating currency, which may eventually take place in one or two more years," said Shen Jianguang , Mizuho Securities' Greater China chief economist.

"While the yuan can float in a wider range, it remains not convertible at the moment as the central bank has retained capital control," Shen told the Sunday Morning Post.

He forecast the yuan might weaken further over the next three months before rebounding as domestic economic growth stabilises. The rate of exchange to the US dollar would likely fluctuate between 6 yuan and 6.25 yuan this year, he said.

Beijing has pledged to further liberalise mainland financial markets by permitting more risk. Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said this month the government would fully relax its control over interest rates within one to two years.

The yuan's continued appreciation last year attracted rapid foreign capital inflows. But slowing economic growth has added downside pressure on the yuan, some analysts say. In the first two months of the year, growth in industrial output, investment, exports and retail sales showed further weakness.

The central bank said the yuan was unlikely to rise or fall dramatically, and urged people to focus more on the mid- to long-term trend.##419|Empty##420|Empty##421|Fannie Mae shares dropped 30% Tuesday. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)

WASHINGTON (AP) — A plan to phase out government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and instead use mainly private insurers to backstop home loans has advanced in Congress.

The agreement by two key senators and a White House endorsement sent shares of Fannie and Freddie sinking Tuesday. Fannie stock fell $1.79, or more than 30%, to $4.03. Freddie dropped $1.48, or 26.8%, to $4.04.

The plan would create a new government insurance fund. Investors would pay fees in exchange for insurance on mortgage securities they buy. The government would become a last-resort loan guarantor.

President Barack Obama proposed an overhaul of Fannie and Freddie last year, but Congress has struggled to craft legislation. The government rescued the two mortgage giants with an $187 bailout, which they have repaid.

The filing comes after the company shuttered 155 of its US locations last month. Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures. The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.

It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain’s image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn’t take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, NY, says its strategy of store closings and balance-sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to “allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy” as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.##424|##425|Empty##426|We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

* Copper hits eight-month low

* Mining stocks hit by Chinese trade data

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - World stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 percent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.

Prices on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 percent.

The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.26 points or 0.43 percent, to 16,382.46, the S&P 500 lost 5.11 points or 0.27 percent, to 1,872.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.229 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,324.994.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.3 percent to $31.14 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6 percent.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 percent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.6 percent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3 percent.

German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3 percent, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world’s top commodity buyer.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.

Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease.

On Wall Street, Boeing Co shares lost 2.5 percent to $125.31 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.

Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 2 percent at $22.92. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations.

CHINESE DATA WEIGHS ON AUSTRALIAN, CANADIAN DOLLARS

The Aussie traded 0.4 percent lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2 percent at $1.1104.

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tann, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.

The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.

The U.S. dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that U.S. job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.743.

In the metals markets, London copper hit an eight-month low. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded down 1.36 percent to $6,690 a tonne. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest level since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels.

The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 97 cents down at $108.03. U.S. oil fell $1.33 to $101.25 a barrel.##438|Top Omnichannel Retailers Total Retail, in conjunction with Radial, a leading omnichannel commerce technology and operations provider, are excited to release the second annual ranking of 100 publicly traded retailers based on their omnichannel capabilities and programs offered, as well as the execution of said programs.

Read More##439|NEW YORK — There aren’t supposed to be any mysteries in the Digital Age.

The answers to most questions, it seems, can be found using Google or Twitter. So maybe that’s why the world is captivated by the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 and why it has created a legion of armchair sleuths, spouting theories in some cases so strange they belong in science-fiction films.

Casual conversations in supermarket aisles, barbershop chairs and office-building cafeterias have centered on the mystery and how much we don’t know. With the search for the missing Boeing 777-200 entering its seventh day, the intrigue — and hypotheses — continue to grow.

“We’re fascinated by it. We don’t know what happened, and we hope for a miracle,” says John DiScala, who runs the travel advice site JohnnyJet.com. “People want an answer, and the suspense is killing them.”

The pros are just as perplexed. On TV and in online forums, aviation experts are more measured and analytical than the amateurs but in the end can’t say with any certainty what happened.

With no distress call, no sign of wreckage and very few answers, the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane is turning into one of the biggest aviation mysteries since Amelia Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean in 1937.

“Anybody who travels is intrigued with this story. How can a plane disappear? We’ve got satellites beaming down on everybody,” says Andrea Richard, a French-American in Paris who travels widely.

Theories abound. Some are serious: There was a catastrophic failure in the airframe or engines or there might have been a pilot error. Other ideas are the kinds to be found in science-fiction movies: a new Bermuda Triangle or an alien abduction.

Terrorism isn’t suspected but hasn’t been ruled out, either. But some people have come up with elaborate plots where the plane is hijacked and lands on a remote island, undetected by radar.

Others have sat in their homes or offices scouring new commercial satellite images of the ocean, looking for any debris from the plane.

False leads and conflicting information have only added to the mystery, the speculation and the frustration. It’s still unclear how far the plane may have flown after losing contact with civilian radar — and in which direction. On Thursday, planes were sent to search an area off the southern tip of Vietnam where Chinese satellite images released by the Chinese government reportedly showed floating objects believed to be part of the plane. Nothing turned up.

Even if the plane is found soon, the speculation likely won’t fade. It can take months or years after a crash to learn definitively what happened.

That’s an anomaly in an age of instant answers. If something isn’t known, we just Google it. If we are lost, we use the GPS on our smartphones to find our location. And if our flight is delayed, the airline sends us a text message.

In this situation — to everybody’s frustration — we still don’t have a conclusion.

TV shows like Lost and movies like Castaway, where people survive a plane crash only to have the rest of the world give up on them, just feed the curiosity.

“This feeds into everyone’s fear of flying. It’s one thing for people to have a fear of dying in a plane crash. It’s another one to die in a plane crash and never be found,” says Phil Derner, founder of the aviation enthusiast website NYC Aviation.

Those within the aviation industry are enthralled with the mystery, too, but from a much more methodical, scientific viewpoint.

“There’s a lot of head scratching going on,” says Daniel Rose, a partner with the aviation accident law firm Kreindler & Kreindler, which is representing the survivors and victims’ families of July’s Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco. “It becomes like a murder mystery almost, these clues that you’re getting and trying to piece it together in a way that makes technical and logical sense.”

Jason Rabinowitz, a self-proclaimed aviation geek whose hobby includes snapping photographs of airplanes taking off and landing, said those in the industry are bringing up previous incidents and previous searches “rather than clinging to straws.”

“The aviation community is more puzzled than the general population because we know more of what would cause an accident and we still have no clue,” Rabinowitz says. “I keep going to sleep every night and hoping that I wake up with some shred of good news, but it isn’t happening.”

Sweet, well behaved one day, an unruly hellion the next? It's about what you'd expect from a 5-year-old.

And so it has been recently with the stock market, which marks the fifth anniversary on March 9 of its bear-market lows, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index touched 666, the mark of the Devil from the Book of Revelation, following a near-biblical set of plagues loosed on the financial system and the world economy in 2007-08. Since that time, the S&P 500 has come roaring back by 175% in round numbers, in what might be the best bull market money can buy.

The pattern continued last week, when stocks swooned on Monday in reaction to the movement of Russian troops in Crimea, only to come roaring back on Tuesday. Then, it became apparent that Vladimir Putin didn't see the need to get into a shooting match, especially when the Russian stock market lost an estimated $58 billion the previous day, even more than the massive $51 billion tab for the Sochi Winter Olympics.

The slide in the ruble also accelerated, forcing the Russian central bank to expend upward of an estimated $12 billion of its reserves to defend the currency, in addition to hiking short-term interest rates sharply. But by week's end, Putin hadn't backed down, and Russian troops were still in Crimea, notwithstanding President Barack Obama's demand that they leave and U.S. threats of sanctions.

The S&P 500 managed on Friday to eke out a gain of a point to mark the bull's birthday with yet another record. More importantly, the five-year advance has increased the value of investors' holdings in U.S. equities by some $16 trillion, according to Wilshire Associates.

Moreover, the Federal Reserve reported last week that U.S. households' net worth surged nearly $3 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year, to a record $80.6 trillion -- some $11.8 trillion above the $68.8 trillion reached in the second quarter of 2007, notes David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. Pacing the gains in the latest quarter were corporate stocks, up $1.3 trillion, and real estate, up $456 billion.

Based on those results, it would seem the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet -- to more than $4 trillion from less than $1 trillion prior to the full fury of the financial crisis starting in September 2008 -- has paid handsomely. As Rosenberg previously noted in this space, there has been a more than 90% correlation between the growth of the central bank's assets and the S&P 500 since the bull market began five years ago.

What's less recognized is the impact that the Fed's quantitative easing has had on interest rates. Perhaps that's because, despite the massive purchases of Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, the benchmark 10-year T-note yield ended the week at 2.79% -- all of four basis points lower than the 2.83% five years earlier.

The real decline has been in private borrowing costs, which is reflected in the collapse in risk spreads on corporate bonds, both investment grade and high yield. High-grade bond spreads have plunged to about 125 basis points over comparable Treasuries, from 600 basis points in March 2009 and 850 basis points at the peak of the crisis in late 2008. Junk spreads have shriveled to about 400 basis points -- which hardly qualifies as "high yield" any more -- from more than 1,800 basis points five years ago and nearly 2,200 basis points in late 2008.

That has been a key element in the equity bull market, allowing quality companies to borrow billions for next to nothing, which they can return to shareholders as dividends or share repurchases, or use to make mega-acquisitions. Think Verizon Communications ' (ticker: VZ) recent purchase of Vodafone s' (VOD) stake in Verizon Wireless, which was funded in part by the biggest U.S. corporate bond offering ever last year, totaling some $49 billion.

To be sure, financial engineering abetted by the Fed's QE also has had real effects. Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho Securities U.S. chief economist, notes that the central bank's actions allowed auto makers to resume offering cut-rate car loans, which has boosted auto demand to precrisis levels. Institutional investors' access to inexpensive debt helped them scoop up large numbers of single-family homes to rent out, while individuals with top credit scores could avail themselves of record-low mortgages rates, helping to clear the housing market.

THE FED IS ON TRACK to wind down its bond purchases and is widely expected to trim another $10 billion from its current $65 billion-a-month pace at the March 18-19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Various officials, from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on down, have indicated it would take a lot to depart from the tapering path embarked upon late last year. The February employment data released on Friday did nothing to alter that.

Notwithstanding the wicked winter weather that was expected to hurt the numbers, nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000, a bit better than the forecasts, while the two preceding months' totals were revised up by a total of 25,000. The headline unemployment rate ticked up by a tenth, to 6.7%, but for a good reason -- a 0.2% increase in the labor force.

As has been discussed ad infinitum, much of the decline in the jobless rate has been because of dropouts from the labor force. Still, the labor-force participation rate remains at 63% of the working-age population, while the employment-to-population rate is at 58.8%, near where it was when the expansion began in June 2009, three months after the bull market's liftoff.

Another positive sign was a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings, but that's where the weather effect might be visible. As JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli writes, the average workweek slipped 0.1 hours, to 34.2 hours, almost certainly because of folks putting in fewer hours because of the weather. But if they got their full week's paycheck nonetheless, it would add up to higher average hourly earnings. While the trend in earnings is higher, Feroli calls last month's jump "fluky."

The consensus view is that the Fed's tapering is a vindication of the economy's ability to stand on its own two feet. Ricchiuto, however, says that auto makers' cheap-financing spurs resulted in General Motors (GM) and Fiat, Chrysler's parent, overproducing and now having to offer incentives to trim inventories. In the housing market, the withdrawal of nontraditional buyers will slow the rise in home prices, "and the cracks in the housing recovery will begin to widen," he says, with real growth slowing from the economy's current 2.25% trend rate.

For that reason, and with official inflation readings well within the Fed's 2% target, there's little reason to expect the monetary authorities to depart from their current glide path for securities purchases. And as New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday, he favors continued stimulus for "a considerable time," with the first increase in the central bank's key interest- rate targets coming "around the middle of 2015" as "a reasonable set of expectations."

Does that mean the bull will see a sixth birthday? Dudley pointed the previous day to a few areas of excess, according to colleague Brendan Conway on Barrons.com -- biotechnology stocks, leveraged loans, and farmland. The first asset class, coincidentally or not, came under considerable pressure late in the week. While it might have been a throwaway line, Dudley, the former chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs (GS), can't be unaware of the market impact of utterances of Fed officials.

In any case, biotechs have been among the market's leaders. And as Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners relates, one of the deans of market analysis (now retired) thinks the stumble in the formerly highflying group is a significant tell for the overall market -- even as it celebrates the fifth anniversary of the rally that has put stock prices at a peak.

NEXT WEEK WILL MARK another, rather less joyous anniversary -- the collapse of Bear Stearns, which happened six years ago and is viewed in hindsight as the beginning of the slide into the credit crisis that erupted full blown the following fall. At the time, however, it was thought absorption of Bear into JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was a one-off thing and that everything was well under control.

That precedent was being invoked last week with the first default on a publicly traded corporate bond in China, of Chaori Solar, which, as its name suggests, flew Icarus-like and crashed. Most commentary suggested it was a good thing to allow the solar-panel maker to fail (see Tech Trader for more questions about solar) rather than for Chinese authorities to risk the moral hazard resulting from bailing out feckless borrowers.

But Citigroup's global macrostrategy team led by Jeremy Hale says not so fast, warning that "this default may be the tip of the iceberg." While the missed interest payment is trivial at about $15 million, "the symbolic significance is much bigger."

Chinese officials face a dilemma, the team writes. "Setting a precedent that investors will always get bailed out is not long-term sustainable policy. Equally, there is no particularly good way to engineer the deflation of a credit bubble."

At the time of the Bear Stearns bust, the cost of insuring U.S. government debt in the credit-default swaps market initially rose in expectation of more bailouts, but then subsided as markets breathed a sigh of relief. But credit-default swap spreads on U.S. debt ultimately widened sharply later in the year, when the crisis was raging.

The Citi team says the default of the Chinese solar company won't necessarily result in a rerun of 2008. But they conclude there may be more corporate credit events ahead than investors expect now.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise — the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."

Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased six percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained nine million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."

(AEO) Tuesday reported a sharp fall in fourth-quarter profit, reflecting asset impairment charges and write-offs. Total net revenues declined 7 percent from last year, with a drop in comparable sales.

However, adjusted earnings as well as revenues beat analysts' expectations. The company also issued a weak outlook for the first quarter. The shares are down more than 6 percent in the early morning.

Looking ahead, the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company said conditions remain challenging, with severe winter weather contributing to weak demand.

Based on a high single-digit decline in comparable sales, it expects earnings per share for the first quarter to be about breakeven compared to adjusted earnings of $0.18 per share reported last year. This forecast excludes potential asset impairment and restructuring charges, the company said.

Analysts are looking for earnings of $0.13 per share for the first quarter.

Jay Schottenstein, Interim CEO said, "The Company's results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations."

On January 22, 2014, American Eagle named Chairman Jay Schottenstein as interim chief executive officer, after Robert Hanson surprisingly announced his resignation.

For the fourth quarter, the company's net income plunged to $10.51 million or $0.05 per share from $94.78 million or $0.47 per share reported last year.

Earnings per share for the recent quarter included charges of $0.22 per share related to asset impairment, asset write-offs and corporate charges as well as related tax.

On an adjusted basis, the firm recorded earnings of $0.27 per share for the 13-week period ended February 1, 2014. Adjusted earnings were $0.55 per share for the 14-week period ended February 2, 2013.

On average, 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings per share of $0.26 for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude one-time items.

Consumer confidence in the US unexpectedly dropped in March to a four-month low, indicating household spending may be slow to pick up from a weather-related setback earlier this year.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of sentiment fell to 79.9 this month from 81.6 in February.

The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for the measure to increase to 82.

Consumers surveyed were more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy.

At the same time, fewer job cuts and higher home values will help keep sentiment from faltering.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.

Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about how to spend the windfall.

Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.

Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

"The whole world wants to belly up to this trough," said Sen. Pat Steadman, who serves on Colorado's budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.

The billionaire hedge fund manager has conspired with members of Congress and outside groups to destroy Herbalife, a nutrition products company, according to the New York Times.

Why?

To win a billion-dollar bet he made that the company would collapse.

And he’s using the federal government to help win that bet.

Despite what you may believe about the seediness of Washington, this is actually unprecedented.

“Mr. Ackman’s campaign to take this fight ‘to the end of the earth,’ using every weapon in the arsenal that Washington offers in an attempt to bring ruin to one company, is a novel one, fusing the financial markets with the political system,” the Times said.

Ackman claims he is trying to take down the company to protect Hispanics, who are apparently Herbalife’s main distributors, but Ackman’s staff says the real goal is to win that bet.

The situation has led to a prominent Democrat-on-Democrat lobbying effort.

Ackman read from a letter he said was written by Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Herbalife. The thing is, the FTC hadn't received the letter yet, and Sanchez didn't post the letter on her website until a month later -- but backdated it for good measure.

Another letter, supposedly written by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also appeared on Ackman's anti-Herbalife website before the senator's press release. Markey's letter to the FTC and Securities and Exchange Commission caused Herbalife's stock to drop by 14 percent.

Ackman also enlisted lobbying firms to help crush Herbalife — including one run by former Rep. Toby Moffett, D-Conn. The other firm is run by a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, Robert Walker.

But wait, there's more! Ackman also hired lobbying firms run by former top aides for President Obama and President Clinton, as well as Jim Papa, who worked on legislative affairs for Obama.

Also contracted: Lobbyist Larry Rasky, a former aide to Markey during his time in the House of Representatives, and lobbyist Malcolm Grace, a former aide to Sanchez. How convenient that both members of Congress would go on to assist Ackman.

The Times claims Ackman also recruited “four members of Congress, a New York State senator, a City Council member in Boston, the majority leader of the Nevada Senate and other elected officials in California” to join his efforts.

Herbalife followed suit, hiring a lobbying group founded by former Clinton administration aides and the Podesta Group, run by Tony Podesta, whose brother, John Podesta, was Clinton's chief of staff and is now a senior counselor in the Obama White House.

Ackman has given far more to Democrats than to Republicans over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Oh, and even if Ackman loses his bet, he’s still going to “personally pursue the Herbalife matter to the end of the earth,” because he’s totally not doing it for the money, remember?##460|Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has dipped over 4% to Rs 576 after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an for all products manufactured at its plant at Karkhadi, Gujarat.

prices ended mixed on Monday, 10 March 2014. Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with modest gains supported on short covering by the shorter-term traders and on some bargain hunting. There may have been a bit of fresh safe-haven buying enter the gold market as news reports said more Russian troops were moving into Ukraine.

Gold for April delivery rose $3.30, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,341.40 an ounce Monday, after trading at a low of $1,327.50 earlier in the session.

May silver fell 1.8 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $20.91 an ounce.

Regarding the situation in Ukraine, reports Monday said that additional Russian troops have been moved to the Crimea region of Ukraine. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported on Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world's second-largest economy in February. China's trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week. The news also limited the upside in gold and silver markets.

Powered by Capital Market - Live News##462|The US state of Colorado collected more than a million pounds in taxes from newly legalised recreational marijuana businesses during the first month of sales.

Colorado's licensed dispensaries generated an incredible total of more than $14 million, putting about $2M (£1.2m) of tax revenue into state coffers in the process.

The money will go towards youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to a plan proposed by Colorado Governor, John Hickenlooper.

Colorado was the first state in the US to licence and tax sales of the drug for recreational use, allowing dozens of shops to open for business on Jan 1, 2014 – to a roaring trade.

Since cannabis use became legal on January 1, Colorado has levied a 12.9% sales tax on all transactions, with medical marijuana taxed at 2.9%.

The state Department of Revenue released the figures on Monday, which showed how much Colorado has taken in from both medical and recreational marijuana taxes and fees.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," Barbara Brohl, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts."

The figures represent the tax returns from 59 businesses around Colorado, according to the department.

In the lead up to legalisation it was estimated that sales would reach $395million (£237million) in the 2014/2015 financial year.

The line stretches around the block on the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales in Denver

Governor John Hickenlooper’s budget office recently dramatically increased it's estimations, announcing that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year.

But Steve Rolles, the Senior Policy Analyst for the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, told the Huffington Post UK that the initial figures are only so high due to "the novelty factor."

He said the huge media coverage both in Colorado and in neighbouring states has caused a massive sales influx and that "we would expect the market to settle down in time."##463|You can toast them, dress them up with pesto or lobster, and even use strange rodents to advertise them, but it turns out that all most people want from a sandwich is to know that it's healthy and cheap.

The bankruptcy filing of Quiznos, announced on Friday, is the latest sign that Americans, burned by the recession and slow recovery, would rather have a $5 footlong sandwich than fancier fare like a toasted sub. The downfall of Quiznos comes as downscale rival Subway is growing rapidly -- the company plans to add 10,000 restaurants in the next four years, according to Businessweek.

It wasn’t always this way. Though much smaller, Quiznos was once a legitimate competitor to Subway. At its height, Quiznos was able to use toasted and (arguably) meatier subs to lure some customers away from Subway’s boring, cold sandwiches, making it Subway’s closest rival in the sandwich game.



A Quiznos chicken sub.

But Quiznos' upscale appeal might also have set the stage for its own destruction.

“Quiznos really came out of the box with a better sandwich concept with a higher price point, which means many of the franchisees went into more expensive locations,” said Darren Tristano, the executive vice president of Technomic, a food research firm. Fancier locations meant higher rent, which meant that Quiznos restaurants needed to constantly be more profitable, Tristano said.

So when the recession hit, Quiznos was in trouble. Suddenly no one cared about the temperature of their sandwich, they just wanted it to be cheap.



The chart above from IBISWorld shows how revenue for the sandwich and sub industry spiked in 2009, thanks largely to the $5 footlong.

With other upscale sandwich chains like Jimmy John's and Potbellys making inroads into Quiznos' niche, the company tried to compete with Subway on price. That decision “proved to be the downfall” for many of the chain's franchises, according to IBISWorld. “The use of premium ingredients in inexpensive menu items squeezed profitability at locations that already faced declining sales,” the report said.

Over the past five years, Quiznos has closed about 2,500 locations, according to IBISWorld, out of more than 4,000 before the recession hit. The company’s sales and market share both dropped by more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2013. It's now third in market share in sandwiches, behind Subway and Jimmy John's. In comparison, Subway has about 40,000 stores worldwide.

And Quiznos didn't just struggle to compete with Subway on pricing. Subway was one of the first large-scale food chains to capitalize on a growing American appetite for healthier foods by touting its own healthy offerings, starting with the Jared Fogle campaign in 2000, according to IBISWorld.





Jared Fogle, a Subway spokesperson, and New York Giants Defensive End Michael Strahan pose with Fogle's old pants while celebrating 10 years of keeping the weight he lost off in New York City.

Quiznos also suffers from a high debt load and a tortured relationship with franchisees, many of whom have sued the chain, alleging that it forced them to pay more for ingredients by buying from a Quiznos-affiliated supplier. Quiznos in 2009 agreed to pay $95 million to settle a series of class-action franchisee suits.

Quiznos is hoping that by filing for bankruptcy protection, the company will have more flexibility to give its franchisees a better deal, according to a news release announcing the bankruptcy.

"Our business plan includes several key elements aimed at supporting our franchisees, including reducing food costs, implementing a franchise owner rebate program, in certain circumstances making loans available to franchisees for restaurant improvements, investing in advertising to improve location awareness, and providing new incentives for prospective franchisees," Quiznos CEO Stuart K. Mathis wrote in the release.##464|SAVE NOW

After six days, what seemed like potential clues to the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have all led nowhere.

“This situation is unprecedented. MH370 went completely silent over the open ocean,” said acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. “This is a crisis situation. It is a very complex operation, and it is not obviously easy. We are devoting all our energies to the task at hand.”

On Thursday, Malaysian authorities expanded their search westward toward India, saying the aircraft with 239 people aboard may have flown for several hours after its last contact with the ground shortly after takeoff early Saturday from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

The U.S. Navy 7th Fleet said it is moving one of its ships, the USS Kidd, into the Strait of Malacca, west of Malaysia.

The international search is methodically sweeping the ocean on both sides of Malaysia. The total area being covered is about 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers) — about the size of Portugal.

One part of the hunt is in the South China Sea, where the aircraft was seen on civilian radar flying northeast before vanishing without any indication of technical problems. A similar-sized search is also being conducted in the Strait of Malacca because of military radar sightings that might indicate the plane turned in that direction after its last contact, passing over the Malay Peninsula.

The jet had enough fuel to reach deep into the Indian Ocean.

“Because of new information, we may be part of an effort to open a new search area in the Indian Ocean,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said, declining to offer additional details about that information or the new area.

In the latest disappointment, search planes failed to find any debris from the Boeing 777 after they were sent Thursday to an area of the South China Sea off the southern tip of Vietnam where satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects.

“There is nothing. We went there. There is nothing,” Hishammuddin said.

Compounding the frustration, he later said the Chinese Embassy had notified the government the images were released by mistake and did not show any debris from the missing flight.

The Wall Street Journal quoted U.S. investigators as saying they suspected the plane stayed in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing engine data automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program. The newspaper later corrected the account to say the information came from the plane’s satellite communication link, not the engines.

A U.S. official on Thursday said the plane was sending signals to a satellite for four hours after the aircraft went missing, an indication that it was still flying.

The official said the plane wasn’t transmitting data to the satellite, but sending out a signal to establish contact. Boeing offers a satellite service that can receive a stream of data during flight on how the aircraft is functioning.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, said Malaysia Airlines didn’t subscribe to that service, but the system was automatically pinging the satellite anyway.

Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said: “Of course. We can’t rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. We are expanding our search into the Andaman Sea.” The sea is northwest of the Malay Peninsula.

He said Malaysia was asking for radar data from India and other neighboring countries to see if they can trace it flying northwest. India says its navy, air force and coast guard will search for the plane in the south Andaman Sea.

More than two-thirds of those on Flight MH370 were from China, which has shown impatience with the absence of any results. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday in Beijing he would like to see better coordination among countries in the search.

The passengers’ “families and friends are burning with anxiety. The Chinese government and Chinese people are all deeply concerned about their safety,” he said at the close of the annual session of the country’s legislature. “As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will not stop searching for the plane.”

He said China had eight ships and 10 satellites searching for the plane.

Malaysia has been criticized for its handling of the search, in part because it took several days to fully explain why it couldn’t say whether the plane had turned back. Officials say they are not hiding anything and are searching areas where the plane is most likely to be, while trying to establish its actual location.

Besides the Chinese satellite photos and the so-far fruitless search based on the possible sighting on military radar, there have been other developments in the aviation mystery that have failed to lead to finding the plane or the cause of its disappearance:

• Oil slicks seen Saturday were found to have nothing to do with the jetliner.

• A yellow object spotted by a search plane turned out to be ordinary sea trash.

• Officials initially said four or five passengers checked in for the flight but did not board, fueling speculation about terrorism. Officials later said some people with reservations never checked in and were simply replaced by standby passengers, and no baggage was removed.

• Officials said two men, later identified as Iranians, boarded the plane with stolen passports. It was later reported that they were unlikely to be linked to terrorist groups.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the plane’s disappearance.

Experts say a massive failure knocking out electrical systems, while unlikely, could explain why the transponders were not working. Another possibility is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.

“There is no real precedent for a situation like this. The plane just vanished,” Hishammuddin said.

Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean, some debris should be floating even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.##466|Empty##467|Pizza image via Shutterstock

US pizza chain Sbarro Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years as a slowdown in mall traffic weighs on sales at its fast food restaurants.

The restauranteur requested protection under Chapter 11 while it reorganizes its finances, according to a filing in US bankruptcy court in New York.

The restructuring will affect about $140 million in Sbarro debt, according to report by rating agency Fitch.

Fitch also discussed a possible bankruptcy at Quizno’s, another medium-sized restaurant chain.

The Sbarro and Quizno’s troubles are “a warning sign of financial distress” confronting many brands in the restaurant industry, Fitch said.

“We do not view them as portending a widespread increase in bankruptcies of US restaurants, but a reflection of difficulties faced by brands that have lost their competitive position and relevancy with consumers.”

Both chains have suffered the growth of competitors like Subway, Little Caesars and Papa John’s. In Sbarro’s case, Fitch said the 68-year-old chain has also lost out from consumers moving away from shopping malls.

Sbarro last month said it was cutting 155 restaurants in North America to reduce costs.

Sbarro’s 2011 bankruptcy resulted in an agreement with creditors to trim its debt from $368 million to $130 million.

Why am I seeing this 'Under Construction' page?##469|European car sales rose by 7.6 percent in February from a year ago, with the gradual economic recovery boosting demand for mass-market brands.

Sales grew 17.8 percent in Spain, 40.2 percent in Portugal and 20.6 percent in Ireland.

Italy, Europe’s fourth-biggest car market, saw sales increase by 8.6 percent .

But in the second-largest – France – they fell 1.4 percent.

Registrations in Germany, the top car market, underperformed the regional trend, with a 4.3 percent increase.

European car sales have suffered a six-year slump, falling to their worst in 20 years, as people cut back on expensive purchases amid austerity and uncertainty about job security.

Context is everything however, and industry players pointed out the gains comes from historic lows. In Italy, for example, car sales are recovering from levels last seen in the 1970s.

“Sales have effectively been growing, but discounting practices have been following a very similar path, it seems,” Carlos Da Silva, an analyst with market researchers IHS Automotive, said in a note. “This would tend to indicate that the overall situation remains more tense than it might appear.”

Breakdown by marque

Sales at Renault Group jumped 11.5 percent, boosted mainly by a 33.6 percent surge in registrations of its cheaper Dacia brand.

Ford sales were up 11.3 percent. Toyota Group, the world’s biggest-selling car maker, posted a 14 percent increase, and General Motors saw sales go up 12.3 percent, boosted by a 15.6 percent increase in registrations of its Opel- and Vauxhall-branded vehicles.

Germany’s Volkswagen group, Europe’s biggest carmaker by volume, posted a 7.2 percent rise, helped by a 21.5 increase at its value brand Skoda, a 15.7 percent jump in Seat sales and an 11.8 percent gain at its premium brand, Audi. VW’s performance was weighed down by a 0.8 percent decline in sales at its namesake brand.

French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen lost some market share in February. Its overall sales grew 3.5 percent, supported by an increase in registrations of its Peugeot brand, but sales of Citroen-branded cars were roughly flat year-on-year.##470|1 of 1 View Caption

The search for the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet that disappeared without a trace more than a week ago was on Monday expanded to include a wider area spanning Australia to Kazakhstan.

Malaysia’s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters here that Australia and Indonesia were leading the search from the west of Sumatra to the south of the Indian Ocean. China and Kazakhstan are searching in the northern corridor from Laos to the Caspian Sea.

Flight MH370 with 239 people on board disappeared on March 8 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lampur. Most of the passengers of the Boeing 777-200 were Chinese nationals.

In addition to hijack, investigators are exploring the possibility of a suicide bid by the pilot or co-pilot, sabotage, kidnapping and terrorism.

A police source said investigators were studying the flight simulator found at the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 52. The experienced pilot is a member of Malaysia’s Opposition party, whose leader, Anwar Ibrahim, was convicted of sodomy a few hours before the jet disappeared.

“So far there’s no evidence politics was involved in this incident,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

Malaysia Airlines said co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid was most likely to have made the final spoken communication with the ATC in Kuala Lumpur before the aircraft disappeared from the radar.

Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, the airline’s chief executive, said the voice from the cockpit said, “All right, good night,” at about 1.19 a.m. on March 8 (1719 GMT, March 7), 12 minutes after the last transmission of data from the jet’s ACARS communications system.##474|Chiquita may be the biggest name in the banana market, but surprisingly, it isn’t the top supplier of the fruit. Or, at least, it wasn’t until today.

Chiquita Brands International has agreed to buy Fyffes Plc, a Dublin-based fruit distributor, for about $565 million, according to a Chiquita and Fyffes joint company statement released Monday. The merger will bring together two of the world’s oldest fruit importers.

Pending approval, the deal will be a boon for investors as well: Fyffes shareholders will get 0.1567 shares of the new company for every one share they own of Fyffles, and Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each Chiquita share. Shares of both companies surged: Fyffes rose 44 percent in Dublin trading, while shares for Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita jumped 14 percent in the morning before leveling off later Monday. It closed up 10.7 percent at $12 a share.

The new company will be called ChiquitaFyffes and be worth an estimated $1.7 billion. It will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but operations will be based in Ireland. Chiquita shareholders will own 50.7 percent of the new company, with Fyffes shareholders owning the remaining 49.3 percent.

"This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business. We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company which is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders," Fyffes Executive Chairman David Cann said in the companies’ joint press statement. “We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers."

Chiquita employs approximately 20,000 workers; Fyffes has about 12,000 workers.

According to the two companies, the merger will create a company grossing $4.6 billion in annual revenue. The merger should be completed by the end of 2014. The deal puts ChiquitaFyffes well ahead of Dole and Del Monte, its chief competitors in the banana distribution market. The new company moves a combined 180 million boxes of bananas per year, while Del Monte and Dole sell 117 million and 110 million, respectively.

Chiquita and Fyffes are both very well-known brands, albeit to different groups of people. Chiquita, formerly known as the United Fruit Company, was founded in 1863 and is the chief banana distributor for the United States. It has a checkered history, fraught with accusations of human rights violations and bribery scandals. In 2010, the company reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the US federal government over allegations that it had financial ties to Colombian paramilitary groups.

Fyffes also began in the 1870s, as a group of banana plantations in the Virgin Islands, and is one of the largest tropical fruit importers in Europe. The company was linked to an insider trading scandal in 2008.##475|NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Colorado raked in about $2 million from taxes on recreational marijuana in January, the first month it was legal to sell non-medicinal pot in the state.

State officials say the numbers came in as expected.

On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational marijuana to anyone age 21 or older. Cannabis purchases are limited to one ounce. It’s the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale.

Colorado places a 15% excise tax, a 10% special sales tax and a 2.9% sales tax on recreational marijuana, in addition to application and license fees. It imposes just a 2.9% sales tax, as well as application on license fees, on medical marijuana, which was legalized by voters in Colorado in 2000.

When combined with taxes and fees from medicinal marijuana, the state brought in a total of $3.5 million in January from pot sales.

The state also taxes alcohol, which brought in about $5.1 million in taxes in December, the most recent data available from the Colorado Department of Revenue.

A big chunk of the funds collected from marijuana taxes will be funneled to programs aimed at keeping kids way from pot. The governor has requested funds for the prevention of youth marijuana, for treatment of substance use, regulatory oversight, and law enforcement and public safety.

While an import alert virtually bans all products from the plant, the company said it had initiated corrective steps and the contribution from this plant to its consolidated revenues was “negligible”.

The alert was issued by the US FDA as a follow up to the last inspection of the facility, during which some non-compliance of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations was identified, Sun said. Its stock-price dipped on the news by over 5 per cent, closing at ₹573 on the BSE, on Thursday.

Even as Sun expects the FDA alert to have minimal impact, reflected in the fact that it has not revised its earlier sales growth projection of 29 per cent for the year ending March 2014 — the development is the latest in a string of US FDA-initiated action against India-based companies.

Ranbaxy and Wockhardt, for instance, have been reeling from the impact of import bans on products from some of its plants.

Nevertheless, US FDA chief Margaret Hamburg, wrapping up her recent maiden visit to India, had clarified that Indian companies were not being targeted, and were merely being put through routine regulatory scrutiny required to keep products safe for American consumers.

Details on Sun’s cGMP transgressions are not known. However, the earlier Ranbaxy and Wockhardt instances of cGMP violations opened up a can on worms, revealing data integrity and basic hygiene issues, ranging from too many flies in the room to tablets with human hair to urine spilling out of the drainage.

Revenue impact



Analysts tracking the sector, though, expect the latest development on Sun not to have a major financial impact. Centrum Broking Senior Vice-President Ranjit Kapadia said the financial impact of the import alert is being estimated at less than one per cent of its revenues.

Angel Broking’s VP-Research, Sarabjit Kour Nangra, pointed out that Sun had a diversified manufacturing infrastructure to cater to the US markets, which contributed around 54 per cent of its sales (in FY 2013).

Sun manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished medicines at Karkhadi. But it had 12 US FDA-approved facilities, with six in the US, three in India and one in Canada, Israel and Hungary, respectively, as on March 2013, Nangra said.

Besides its subsidiaries, Taro and Caraco also contribute a major chunk of its sales, she added.

>jyothi.datta@thehindu.co.in##480|Gold futures ended higher for a second straight session on Tuesday, as continued to closely monitor the tussle between Russia and the West over Ukraine, even as the crucial referendum in Crimea comes up for vote next Sunday to determine the status of the region. The referendum will decide if people in the Crimea region would prefer to stay with Ukraine or join Russia.

Gold prices also found support on renewed safe haven buying, as investors continued to mull over some weak Chinese trade data which suggests the sluggishness in the nation's may be more than initially envisaged.

The ongoing tension in Ukraine continued with the country's parliament warning the Crimean assembly that it would be dissolved if the referendum slated for Sunday takes place, which calls for the region to join Russia. The Crimean assembly has been given time until Wednesday to stop the referendum.

Gold for April delivery, the most actively traded contract, gained $5.20 or 0.4 percent to close at $1,346.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday.

Gold for April delivery scaled an intraday high of $1,353.00 and a low of $1,337.80 an ounce.

Yesterday, gold futures settled higher, after data on Saturday showed China's exports in February plummeted over 18 percent from last year.

Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to 812.70 tons from its previous close.

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against six major currencies, traded at 79.79 on Tuesday, up from its previous close of 79.75 late Monday in North American trade. The dollar scaled a high of 79.93 intraday and a low of 79.72.

The euro traded lower against the dollar at $1.3861 on Tuesday, as compared to its previous close of $1.3877 late Monday in North America. The euro scaled a high of $1.3879 intraday and a low of $1.3834.

In economic news, wholesale inventories in the U.S. rose more than expected in January, a report from the Commerce Department showed Tuesday, notwithstanding a steep drop in wholesale sales. Wholesale inventories climbed 0.6 percent in January following an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in December. Economists expected inventories to rise by 0.4 percent compared to the 0.3 percent growth originally reported for the previous month.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said wholesale sales tumbled 1.9 percent in January after inching up 0.1 percent in December. The drop was partly due to a 3.2 percent decrease in sales of non-durable goods, which edged up by 0.2 percent in the previous month.

From Europe, industrial production growth in U.K. slowed more-than-expected in January as severe weather conditions hampered oil production in the North Sea, data from the Office for National Statistics showed Tuesday. Nonetheless, manufacturing output topped expectations with broad-based expansion in most sub-sectors offsetting sharp contraction in pharmaceutical products. U.K.'s industrial output in January edged up 0.1 percent from December. The output was forecast to expand 0.2 percent, following December's 0.5 percent rise.

Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan on Tuesday refrained from initiating additional easing ahead of the planned sales tax hike in April that could dent the moderate recovery. The central bank's policy board decided by a unanimous vote to leave the size of its monetary easing unchanged. Accordingly, the bank will continue to increase the monetary base at an annual pace of JPY 60 trillion to JPY 70 trillion.

Investors will also focus on a slew of economic data out of the U.S. this week, ahead of the monetary policy meet of the U.S. Federal Reserve due March 19. The major releases slated for the week include weekly jobless claims, inventories report, producer price index, consumer sentiment, and retail sales report.

Market Analysis##481|In The Arena Don’t Send America’s Natural Gas to Ukraine

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given a boost to those calling for the United States to expedite natural gas exports to help allies overseas. In this thinking, American gas exports — in the form of liquefied natural gas, or LNG — are not only a boon to the domestic economy but also a potent geopolitical tool to be wielded against the Kremlin.

Never mind that the United States won’t have its first LNG export terminal in operation until late 2015 at the very earliest; that all of its approved gas exports are already committed to long-term contracts; and that Ukraine does not even have a single terminal for receiving LNG.

Story Continued Below

Even without the newly concocted geopolitical rationale for exports, though, Washington seems favorably disposed to permitting much of America’s surplus gas to migrate overseas. Since the beginning of the shale gas revolution, which kicked off in 2005 , the U.S. Department of Energy has approved six LNG export terminals with a combined export capacity of 8.5 billion cubic feet a day, and more projects are in the works.

But before we put more of our gas in the service of our foreign policy, be it saving Europe from Russia’s claws or Asia from its toxic air, we should ask ourselves one question: Why aren’t we using more gas in our cars and trucks?

Most of America’s newly cheap gas finds its way to the electricity sector, where it displaces coal as a fuel source. Coal’s share of total electricity generation declined from 51 percent 10 years ago to 40 percent today; that percentage will continue to drop as the Obama administration persists in its effective ban on new coal-fired power plants. The shift from coal to gas has brought a 10 percent decline in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from power plants since 2010, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, negating the political pressure for costly carbon cap-and-trade schemes. The shale gas industry also has created more than 600,000 jobs, stimulated economic growth and reduced consumer costs of products derived from natural gas, such as plastics, household chemicals and the fertilizers that make our food. But all these benefits pale in comparison to what could be achieved if the gas replaced oil instead of coal.

First, a little math. The best way to compare energy sources is to look at their cost per unit of heat, measured in British thermal units. The spot price of 1 million BTUs, expressed as mmbtu, derived from natural gas is about $4.30. The price of U.S. coal is more or less the same. At current oil prices, the price of 1 mmbtu derived from oil is roughly $17. That means that from a pure economic standpoint, the upside of replacing coal with natural gas is zero, while that of replacing oil with natural gas is $12.7 per mmbtu. Put differently, at current prices, the 3.5 trillion cubic feet of gas that the Energy Information Administration assumes the United States will be exporting annually starting next decade is valued at $15 billion. If this amount of gas stayed in the United States and were used to power cars and trucks, it would have displaced, depending on the technology, 3 million to 4 million barrels of oil a day, eliminating oil imports at the cost of $100 billion to $150 billion a year. Instead, the United States will be exporting this $15 billion worth of energy only to import an equivalent amount of energy at up to 10 times the cost. Does that make any sense?

The reason for this economic malpractice is that our transportation sector is wedded to oil. Natural gas landed in the power sector not necessarily because electricity is the most economic use of the commodity but because our grid and electric appliances are indifferent about the source of energy that goes into making the electrons they use. For a light bulb or coffee machine, electrons made from coal, gas, nuclear or solar are all the same.

Cars are a different story. They do care what source of energy goes into their tank because for the most part they are warrantied to run on nothing but petroleum fuels. This means that no matter how cheap and plentiful natural gas becomes, its pathway to our vehicles is blocked.

Although there are some efforts to increase the use of natural gas as an automotive fuel, they are limited to heavy-duty trucks and buses, and therefore will not get us close to capturing the full economic opportunity offered by the shale gas revolution. Consider this: On our current trajectory, according to the Energy Information Administration, the increased use of compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas in vehicles will offset only 3 percent of petroleum consumption in the transportation sector in 2040. This is a profoundly disappointing figure. If the natural gas bonanza is to benefit every American, it must penetrate the light-duty sector, where 60 percent of our transportation fuel is used.

One way of doing so is to reduce the cost of converting a light-duty gasoline car to CNG. Right now, that process comes out to roughly $10,000 per light-duty vehicle, more than three times the average price tag in other parts of the world. By streamlining the onerous regulatory requirements consumers are currently facing, the EPA could make this option widely available.

Another option is to turn the gas into gasoline and diesel in a process called gas-to-liquids. But for a GTL plant to make money, a barrel of oil has to cost about 16 times more than natural gas. That ratio is too high to expect over the long run, which is why Royal Dutch Shell recently abandoned its $20 billion GTL project in Louisiana.

A more fiscally prudent way of using natural gas in transportation is to open light-duty vehicles to run on a liquid fuel called methanol. This high-octane alcohol can be blended into gasoline, much in the way ethanol is blended. Properly adjusted “flexible fuel” vehicles, which cost automakers a $100 or so more to manufacture than gasoline-only cars, allow drivers to choose whether to run on methanol, gasoline or some combination of the fuels. If Congress provided automakers with the right incentives, within five years, a substantial part of America’s fleet would be capable of running on natural-gas-derived methanol — at no additional cost to taxpayers.

To be sure, in the coming years there will be times when natural gas prices inch up while oil prices decline, but it is highly unlikely that oil will ever become cheaper than natural gas per unit of energy. The arbitrage opportunity in shifting from oil to gas in the transportation sector is too appealing to let go. But as long as our cars are locked to gasoline, America’s natural gas will go to fuel power plants in Asia and Europe instead of cars at home. And while the sellers of the gas may be indifferent as to where it ends up, for Americans as a whole, this amounts to a scandalous waste of an opportunity.

MYTH: Enrollment Of Previously Uninsured Insufficient To Make Health Law Work

The Columbus Dispatch: ACA Isn't Enrolling Enough Youth Or Previously Uninsured. The Columbus Dispatch claimed the ACA was failing to enroll the target demographic of the health care reform, those who werepreviously uninsured:

The Affordable Care Act has unleashed upon the American people an avalanche of regulations, booted people off insurance plans they were promised they could keep, killed jobs, raised costs and generated turmoil in an industry that accounts for a sixth of the nation's economy. And so far, it has largely failed to do the very thing it was set up for: to insure the uninsured. [The Columbus Dispatch, 3/14/14]

FACT: Uninsured Expected To Sign Up Later Than Previously Insured

Kaiser Family Foundation VP: "Early Enrollment Skewed Towards The Already Insured." According to Larry Levitt, VP of the Kaiser Family Foundation, people who were previously uninsured will likely sign up later, after those whose plans were discontinued or those whose preexisting conditions forced them out of the insurance market:

"There's every reason to believe that early enrollment skewed towards the already insured and that the uninsured will sign up later," Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan organization, told TPM. "People who were insured and had their old non-compliant policies cancelled were no doubt first in line in the new marketplaces, along with some people with pre-existing conditions who were locked out of the market before." [Talking Points Memo, 3/7/14]

TPM: Insurance Trend "Seems To Suggest That The Uninsured Are Starting To Flock Toward The Law." As Talking Points Memo reported, a survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that 27 percent of people who signed up for health insurance in February were previously uninsured, up from an average of 11 percent from October to January. TPM commented that the finding "seems to suggest that the uninsured are starting to flock toward the law":

A new survey has found that 27 percent of people who signed up for coverage in February were previously uninsured. On its face, that finding -- from McKinsey and Company, a national consulting firm -- might sound like bad news for the law and the White House. The broader trend, however, seems to suggest that the uninsured are starting to flock toward the law. The average percentage of uninsured enrollees had been 11 percent from October to January, according to the firm, so 27 percent is a significant jump. That makes sense, health policy experts say. People who already had coverage likely didn't wait to sign up; they're used to being insured and they wouldn't want their coverage to lapse. But for uninsured people, being insured isn't the status quo, so they might take more time to enroll. Their deadline is March 31. [Talking Points Memo, 3/7/14]

McKinsey & Company: 65 Percent Of Those Who Plan To Sign Up By March 31 Are Previously Uninsured. A survey by McKinsey & Company's Center for U.S. Health System Reform found that 65 percent of people who said they plan to enroll by the March 31 deadline are currently uninsured. [McKinsey & Company, 3/6/14]

MYTH: McKinsey Study Proves Previously Uninsured Aren't Signing Up In Large Numbers

Columbus Dispatch: Only Small Percentage Of Those Signing Up Were Previously Uninsured. A Columbus Dispatch editorial cited a Forbes op-ed by Manhattan Institute senior fellow Avik Roy in which he claimed that the McKinsey survey showed that the main goal of the law -- providing insurance to those who were previously uninsured -- is failing:

In a March 8 op-ed for Forbes, Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, notes that the White House has seriously inflated its Affordable Care Act numbers on two fronts: "First, not everyone who has 'selected a marketplace plan' under Obamacare has actually paid the require premiums, payment being required to actually gain coverage. "Second, only a fraction of people on the exchanges were previously uninsured." Roy cites a survey from McKinsey & Co., a global management-consulting firm, based on percentages of those who had enrolled as of Feb. 1. He concludes: "Only 19 percent of those who have paid a premium were previously uninsured. Among those that the administration is touting as sign-ups, only 14 percent are previously uninsured enrollees: approximately 472,000 people." [The Columbus Dispatch, 3/14/14]

FACT: McKinsey Survey Did Not Include Medicaid Signups In Uninsured Enrollment Data

TPM: McKinsey Survey Measuring Uninsured Enrollment Did Not Account For Medicaid Signups. As TPM reported, the McKinsey survey did not account for the number of people who were previously uninsured who signed up for insurance under Medicaid (emphasis added):

McKinsey and Company surveyed 2,096 people who would eligible to buy insurance on HealthCare.gov and its state counterparts, both previously insured and uninsured. The survey doesn't account for Medicaid enrollees, which could also significantly cut into the uninsured rate. According to Kaiser, 31 percent of uninsured Americans have an income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level -- the threshold for expanded Medicaid under the law in states that chose to participate. The Obama administration has said that nearly nine million people have enrolled in Medicaid since Obamacare launched in October, though that number includes both new sign-ups and renewals. An independent analysis estimated that between 1.1 million and 1.8 million new enrollees could be attributed to the law through January. There is also some mixed signals outside of the McKinsey survey, though it is likely the most comprehensive attempt to gauge Obamacare's direct impact on the uninsured. The administration is not tracking the statistics for those signing up through HealthCare.gov. [Talking Points Memo, 3/7/14]

Wash. Post: "Ohio's New Medicaid Expansion Could Cover 330,000 People." According to the Washington Post's Wonkblog, Medicaid expansion in Ohio could cover as many as 330,000 low-income Ohioans out of about 1.5 million state residents who are uninsured. [The Washington Post, 10/21/13; Kaiser Family Foundation, accessed 3/14/14]

MYTH: Enrollees Who Have Not Yet Paid Premiums Pose A Threat To ACA Stability

The Columbus Dispatch: Enrollees Who Have Signed Up But Have Yet To Pay Could Destabilize HealthLaw. The Dispatch said the number of enrollees who have yet to make their first premium payment could jeopardize the stability of the health care exchanges:

On March 6, The Post pointed to the McKinsey study and also raised the premium-payment problem. It noted, "Just over half of uninsured people said they'd started to pay, compared with nearly 9 in 10 of those signing up on exchanges who said they were simply switching from one health plan to another." This threatens the scheme's financial underpinning. [...] The administration's enrollment numbers show that 4.2 million Americans have "signed up" for private health plans, but this number throws in shoppers who haven't paid with actual purchasers. [Columbus Dispatch, 3/14/14]

FACT: Surveys Show That Majority Of Enrollees Pay Their Premiums

CNNMoney Survey Found That The Number Of People Who Have Yet To Pay Their Premiums Is Less Than 30 Percent. CNNMoney reported that, according to insurers polled by the outlet, about "one in five people who picked health insurance policies on the state and federal exchanges last year haven't paid their first month's premiums." CNNMoney further reported:

Some 2.1 million people signed up for a plan in time for their coverage to start January 1, according to the Obama administration. But with the payment deadlines stretching until January 31 at the latest, anywhere between 12% and 30% of those folks still haven't paid up, insurers say. [CNNMoney, 1/30/14]

NY Times: Only About "One In Five People" Has Failed To Pay Their Premiums. According to The New York Times, "One in five people who signed up for health insurance under the new health care law failed to pay their premiums on time and therefore did not receive coverage in January, insurance companies and industry experts say." The article continued:

Lindy Wagner, a spokeswoman for Blue Shield of California, said that 80 percent of those who signed up for its plans had paid by the due date, Jan. 15. Blue Shield has about 30 percent of the exchange market in the state. Matthew N. Wiggin, a spokesman for Aetna, said that about 70 percent of people who signed up for its health plans paid their premiums. For Aetna policies taking effect on Jan. 1, the deadline for payment wasJan. 14, and for products sold by Coventry Health Care, which is now part of Aetna, the deadline was Jan. 17. Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, said last week that the company had 135,000 "paid members," out of 200,000 who began to enroll through the exchanges. "I think people are enrolling in multiple places," he said in a conference call. "They are shopping. And what happens is that they never really get back on HealthCare.gov to disenroll from plans they prior enrolled in." Kristin E. Binns, a vice president of WellPoint, said that 76 percent of people selecting its health plans on an exchange had paid their share of the first month's premium by the due date of Jan. 31. The company had received more than 500,000 applications for individual coverage through the exchanges in 14 states, she said. Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal exchange and supervises state marketplaces, said the government did not know how many people had paid their premiums and thus "effectuated" coverage. But in interviews and in the quarterly reports on their financial performance, insurers provided data indicating that four-fifths of applicants had met payment deadlines. One big company, Humana, said it had received 200,000 applications for insurance through the exchanges. "About 75 percent of the people paid, and 25 percent did not pay," said Thomas T. Noland Jr., a senior vice president there. Customers had until Jan. 31 to pay for coverage that took effect on Jan. 1. [The New York Times, 2/13/14]

The Urban Institute: Low-Income And Previously Uninsured People Are Less Likely To Have Heard About Health Exchanges. According to research conducted by the Urban institute, uninsured and low-income Americans report high rates of people who have not heard about the insurance marketplaces:

While these ACA target subgroups were more likely to have looked for or have planned to look for information in the Marketplaces than their respective reference groups, they were also more likely not to have heard at all about the Marketplaces. For example, 23.4 percent of uninsured respondents, 27.0 percent of adults in low-income families, and 22.6 percent of those age 18-34 had not heard about the Marketplaces--significantly higher than the full population average (17.1 percent) and the averages for the respective reference groups. [Urban Institute, 3/5/14]

NY Times: People Have Many Reasons For Not Paying Premiums. As a February 14 New York Times article explained, people may not be paying their premium because they haven't received a bill or they decided they did not want the health plan they originally applied for:

People could have many reasons for not paying their premiums. Some decided they did not want a health plan for which they had applied. Some never received an invoice from the insurance company, or received it late. In addition, phone lines of some health plans were overwhelmed. [New York Times, 2/14/14]

American Academy Of Family Physicians: Enrollees Have A 90-Day Grace Period To Pay Their Premiums. As noted by the American Academy Of Family Physicians, a prevision of the ACA allows for a 90-day grace period before insurers can drop enrollees who have not paid their premiums:

Current laws and regulations on late and outstanding premium payments vary by state, with some states allowing insurers to drop consumers' policies without advance notice. Other states require insurers to offer a 30-day grace period before dropping customers' plans. Under rules issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), consumers will get a 90-day grace period to pay their outstanding premiums before insurers are permitted to drop their coverage. The rule applies to all consumers, in all states, who purchase subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) health insurance marketplace. The rule also requires insurers to reimburse providers during the first 30 days of the 90-day grace period. If a consumer still fails to make a payment after 90 days and his or her coverage is dropped, depending on most state laws, insurers will not be required to pay for claims incurred during the last 60 days of the grace period. If coverage is dropped for nonpayment, physicians must work directly with patients to collect payments for the balance incurred during days 31-90 of the grace period. [American Academy Of Family Physicians, accessed 3/14/14]

MYTH: Lagging Youth Enrollment Will Destabilize ACA

Columbus Dispatch: Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up For Health Insurance To Save The Law. The Columbus Dispatch claimed the number of young people enrolling will not be enough to stabilize the health care market:

Only about 25 percent of enrollees are young people, far short of the 40 percent necessary to make the health-care scheme financially viable. Without the young and healthy to underwrite the old and the sick, the price of health care will skyrocket. [Columbus Dispatch, 3/14/14]

FACT: Enough Young People Have Already Signed Up To Make ACA Stable And Profitable To Insurance Companies

Wash. Post: "Young People Sign Up Later -- Typically Right Before The Penalty Hits." In response to the January enrollment report from the Health and Human Services Department, The Washington Post's Ezra Klein explained that the current enrollees are "not the final risk pool" because, based on previous experience with health care enrollment, "Younger people sign up later -- typically right before the penalty hits":

1. Let's begin with what we know: The Department of Health and Human Services reports that 24 percent of the people purchasing health insurance through Obamacare's insurance marketplaces are between ages 18 and 34. That's below the 38 percent that most people -- including the Obama administration -- estimate the law needs if it's to keep premiums as low as everyone hopes. 2. But -- and this can't be emphasized enough -- this is not the final risk pool. No one anywhere expected that the risk pool would be balanced by Jan. 1. Major health laws always follow the same pattern: The people who badly need insurance sign up first, and they tend to be older and sicker. Younger people sign up later -- typically right before the penalty hits. So far, the age pattern in Obamacare enrollment is tracking the age pattern in enrollment for the Massachusetts reforms quite closely: The new numbers see Obamacare through December, which is the law's third month of open enrollment and its first month of open enrollment with a working Web site. So you can decide whether February, March or April offer the right comparison to Massachusetts. Whichever month you choose, Obamacare's enrollment pattern looks a whole lot more like Massachusetts than I would've thought given the disastrous launch and the challenging political environment. [The Washington Post, 11/14/13]

Wash. Post: Stabilization Mechanisms Will Prevent ACA From "Facing A 'Death Spiral.'" The Washington Post's Ezra Klein and Evan Soltas outlined "interlocking fail-safes" in the ACA that are designed to stabilize costs if the enrollee pool has disproportionately high health care needs, including provisions like risk corridors, reinsurance and the individual mandate.

3. Risk corridors. Among the least well-known fail-safes in Obamacare are the subsidies to insurers who underprice their insurance. The way this works is that if insurers' actual costs are more than 3 percent above their "target" costs, the government gives them 50 percent of the difference. If they're more than 8 percent above their target costs, the government pays 80 percent of the difference. (The program goes in reverse, too: If an insurer overprices their insurance, they have to pay part of the excess to the government.) The program exists only for the first three years of the law. But it basically gives insurers a huge incentive to price their insurance low. They don't want to go too low because the program ends in 2016 and they'll lose their customers if they need to raise rates by 500 percent. But for an insurer who's just trying to wait out a bad 2014, the risk corridors are a real buffer. As Adrianna McIntyre wrote, they help plans "weather 2014′s uncertainty and probably keep the following year's premiums relatively unchanged as the risk pool normalizes." 4. Reinsurance. This is the little brother of the risk corridors. For the first three years of Obamacare, the government basically subsidizes particularly expensive enrollees. So if someone buys insurance and their claims break $50,000 in 2014, the federal government picks up part of the cost. The result is that, for the first few years, really sick people cost insurers less than they normally would, and so can be expected to have less of an effect on premiums than would typically be expected. 5. The individual mandate. The reason the Obama administration is so dead-set against delaying the individual mandate is that it's a key fail-safe against a death spiral. There's a lot of confusion over the actual costs of the individual mandate, so here's a reminder: In 2014, it's $95 or 1 percent of adjusted income (which is income minus the tax filing threshold, which is $10,000 for individuals and $20,000 for families), whichever is greater. In 2015, it's $325, or 2 percent of adjusted income, whichever is greater. In 2016, it's $695 or 2.5 percent of adjusted income, whichever is greater. The reason I keep italicizing "whichever is greater" is because it's the part that really matters. A lot of people believe the mandate's penalty in year one is $95. It isn't. Almost everyone who faces the mandate makes more than $9,500. So imagine someone making $53,000. For them, the mandate's cost in year one is $430. By year three, it's $1,075. That's a lot of money. [The Washington Post, 11/7/13]

Kaiser Family Foundation: Youth Enrollment Of 25 Percent Would Still Leave Room For Insurance Companies To Profit. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, even if youth enrollment stalled at 25 percent, it would still allow insurance companies to turn a profit and stabilize the enrollment marketplace:

Under this scenario, young adults would represent 25% of enrollees, substantially less than their share of the potential market... But, if this more extreme assumption of low enrollment among young adults holds, overall costs in individual market plans would be about 2.4% higher than premium revenues. Insurers typically set their premiums to achieve a 3-4% profit margin, so a shortfall due to skewed enrollment by age could reduce the profit margin of insurers substantially in 2014. But, even in the worst case, insurers would still be expected to earn profits, and would then likely raise premiums in 2015 to make up the shortfall, However, a one to two percent premium increase would be well below the level that would trigger a "death spiral," which would occur if insurers needed to increase premiums substantially, in turn further discouraging young and healthy people from enrolling. [Kaiser Family Foundation, 12/17/13]

The Atlantic: Massachusetts' Health Care Reform Enrollment Started Slow, Accelerated Over Time. According to The Atlantic, Massachusetts' health care reform law, which the ACA is modeled after, had slow initial enrollment, but saw enrollment levels spike as the penalty deadline approached:##485|Empty##486|Empty##487|An MTA worker was struck by a Metro-North train in East Harlem Monday, officials said. View Full Caption Flickr/MTAPhotos

MANHATTAN — An MTA worker died after being struck by a Metro-North train in East Harlem Monday morning, officials said.

James Romansoff, 58, was finishing up weekend track work with two others near Park Avenue and East 106th Street when the train hit him about 1 a.m., MTA and FDNY officials said.

Preliminary investigation indicated it was an accident and that the worker left the blocked off work area to retrieve an item when he was hit, sources said.

"They knew the train was coming, but he apparently walked off for something," a source said.

Romansoff, who had worked for the MTA for eight years, was taken to Mount Sinai hospital and pronounced dead, the MTA said.

"The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family,” said Metro-North President, Joseph Giulietti.

Romansoff and his crew were restoring power to the tracks after they were closed for weekend maintenance, the MTA said.

Neighbors described hearing a loud screech about 1 a.m.

Jovanna McCoy, who was at her mother's home at 102nd Street and Park Avenue, ran to the window overlooking the elevated tracks and watched as emergency responders converged on the accident site, she said.

"I'm devastated to find out this man has died," McCoy said.

Thirty-six people were aboard the Hudson line train that had just left Grand Central en route to Poughkeepsie, the MTA said.

The motorman knew about work in the area and was driving accordingly before he hit Romansoff, sources said.

The passengers were transferred to another train and continued their journey north about 2:15 a.m., the MTA said.

The train that hit Romansoff was taken away by daybreak, McCoy said.

The MTA, along with two federal agencies, was still investigating the circumstances of the incident, a spokesman said.

The National Transportation Safety Board was dispatching three investigators, they said.

"Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad," Giulietti said.

Monday's train fatality came seven days after the MTA unveiled its "100-Day Action Plan," a list of proposals to improve safety throughout Metro-North in light of the Dec. 1 derailment that killed 4 people and injured dozens more.

The plan, which includes a proposal to give track workers a confidential code that they have to send dispatchers before trains can return to the rails, is intended to strengthen safety procedures, according to the MTA.

The plan has not been fully implemented, an MTA spokeswoman said.

Retail sales climbed 11.8 percent in January and February compared to the year ago period, the government said. Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, was up 17.9 percent in the first two months from the same period last year, the bureau said, some way below forecasts for a 19.4 percent increase.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial output to rise 9.5 percent and retail sales to rise 13.5 percent. Fixed-asset investment for the January-February period was seen up 19.4 percent.

Annual growth in factory output in the first two months of the year is the weakest since March 2009.##489|Mahboob A. Khawaja

Global mankind feels tormenting pains and anguish to search for the missing Malaysian Flight 370 and to find rational answers, so far, unknown and perhaps unavailable. A tragedy in its making and unfolding day by day to the unknown horizons in critical analysis of a crisis situation. What went wrong to the aviation system that despite all of the information-age advancements and technological sophistication, none can tell with surety what tragedy hit the flight 370 enroute to Beijing with 239 passengers on board?

Throughout the globe, security and aviation experts and common folks engaged in finding some reasonable consolation to growing concerns would like to comprehend what the Malaysian authorities knew once the plane was missing.

Strange as it seems, nine days later, Prime Minister Najib Razik asserts that it was a “deliberate” diversion of the plane. Why the plane was not reported missing once it failed to transform into Vietnamese airspace? Time and prompt action could have changed the unknown outcome. How come the sudden diversion to the West of the Malaysian airspace was not detected by any of its air force or radar surveillance? Unusual as is, the plane’s transponder was turned off but it did not alarm any control tower observers. In any crisis situation, facts gathering and facts analysis are the primary point of investigation into the problem. Suspicious and paranoid most international experts and media commentators are on the crux of the problems of the mystery flight, facts were hard to filter out from the responsible Malaysian officials - both civilians and military even after seven days had lapsed. At times, the Malaysian authorities appear very reluctant to share even basic crude information related to the missing flight. At Kuala Lumpur, the initial briefings and press conferences lacked coherent and substantial data on the flight progressive path once it was reported to have disappeared from the radar. Zahaire Shah, the pilot is reportedly to have said “All right, good night” but to whom? A week later his voice is under scrutiny. Were there other suspected activists on board who might have re-routed the plane to some unknown destination? Lately, the existence of large lithium batteries in cargo was cited for the mishap. Today, the Malaysian Prime Minister Razik conceived the possibility that the plane was taken-over by someone else. Also Prime Minister Najib disclosed that, "based on new satellite communication, we can say with a high degree of certainty that ... ACARS was disabled just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular Malaysia." Despite all this, the whereabouts of the plane are unknown. Perhaps, the official were unaware of the extent of human anxieties and concerns of the loved-ones and of those passengers who went missing abruptly without a trace. Tragedies demand immediate attention and workable alternatives and remedies as they bring the mankind together regardless of ethnicities, religions, and political affiliations as did the Japanese Tsunami in 2011.

Was the plane hijacked or its operation sabotaged by some passengers or group of terrorists? Most often, the thought process commandeered the media analysts to variety of casual but probable scenarios, still in the making process. A vital question begs a rational answer. Did the Malaysian authorities have the professional capacity to understand highly complex and multiple dimensions of the tragedy and be able to cope with its short and long terms impacts on public mind? From the outset, and based on their initial reactionary gatherings and interactive communication to the relatives and friends of the passengers, the poor PR performance and lack of tangible information of the facts of the flight made things worst to all concerned. Clearly, the reliability factor was absent during the information exchange. The officials demonstrated more stars and stripes and so many stood to face the audience without any logical discourse and coherent framework of strategies to communicate effectively with diverse audience and viewers watching across the globe. Why the Malaysian authorities were not equipped to deal with a critical and highly challenging crisis situation of their own making? Not embittered but understanding the painful tragic incident, the global audience wanted to help the Malaysian authorities only if they wanted collaboration from all with professional knowledge and expertise in analyzing previous air disasters and coming up with evidence-based conclusions. In an emergency of this proportion, humanity comes to share all it could to find answers and alleviate the sufferings of the victims and attain comforting and sustainable solution. Perhaps, this message did not resonate well to the Malaysian officials. After nine days of the disappearance of the flight 370, they are not sure about the essential facts of the crisis management and continued to demonstrate indifference toward global cooperation and help as it should have been the staring point of the investigation.

What happened to the Flight 370? Nobody with certainty could answer this question.

The CNN appear to have organized the best possible knowledge-based discussions and presentations enriched with know-how, when there was no information on the missing flight, and participating analytical experts from the aviation industry, legal and security apparatus offered penetrating insights to the crisis management. Some theories and foresight as to how the flight got lost were plausibly logical and should have paved ways to investigators to ponder for more thought provoking process. Is the flight 370 is simply missing somewhere on this planet, or we lack the information-based capacity to know where to exactly look for it? If it crashed somewhere, would the debris be still floating on water? Understandably, there are 43 ships and 58 aircrafts of 14 or more nations and numerous other advanced technological entities are engaged in search for the mystery flight 370. Yet, after a week of concerted efforts, nothing has turned out to be known, what was unknown from the beginning - how did the flight 370 go missing? What could possibly have happened to its international 239 passengers, the crew and the plane itself? None could substantiate with reasonable answers except human theories and guesswork and speculatory “pings” coming from the plane engine system, sketchy radar signals unable to calculate the proper direction of the flight and lot more, perhaps unthinkable in a rational analytical construct. An instinctive recognition of the unknown and unthinkable allusion comes into a world of willing suspicion of disbelief, be it the experts or the concerned global viewers.

More we ponder on the unknown tragedy of the mystery flight, more critical and painful it comes to be felt throughout the hearts and minds of the global mankind to seek rational answers, when there are no answers but conflicting analogies and perceptions – what might have happened to the missing flight. One CNN female moderator set the human feelings clearly: “I have never been to Malaysia but for the last six nights, I could not sleep.” Undeniably, the common flourishing sentiment rests on the moral and humanitarian concerns - the well being and safety of the 239 passengers and what happened to them? The global human instinct remains deeply touched by the unfolding cumbersome developments of the lost flight. Who will answer the focal question - where is this flight? The agonizing search is shifting metaphor minute by minute and now investigators are looking beyond the original parameters and more towards the Indian Ocean, West of Malaysia and South China Sea region. But theories and scenarios are overshadowed by individual and collective concerns of all the parties involved in the search. Rather than narrowing the areas of immediate search, its hurriedly fluxed expansion seems to signal chaotic mental microscope looking for rational answers. To an ordinary folk watching the news, why are we unable to locate the flight after nine days of strenuous efforts?

Often crisis situations offer a healthy challenge to our ingenuity, sense of humanity and responsibility. Rejecting wait and see attitude and behavioral indifference for a worthy humanitarian cause, the spontaneous collaborative response outpoured from various countries such the USA, Europe, Thailand, Vietnam, India, China, Australia and others to assist the Malaysian government in locating the missing flight. The spirit of global volunteerism in a crisis situation is of utmost importance and value to build a better future for humanitarian cooperation.

Be it a “terrorism” scenario of the few, planned hijacking of Flight 370, mechanical failure of the plane systems or “sabotage” by some sadistic and cruel minds, the truth will be discovered sooner or later. No insane manifestation could triumph in this tragic situation as the individual and collective conscience of the mankind is fully in tact and living across the globe to pray and hope for the best of 239 human lives. The framework of multinational cooperation must be admired whether the plane is somewhere in tact or vanished in the shallow waters of the sea or landed somewhere in a disbelief scenario that we do not know yet. Facts will be known when the flight recorder and other data are found - how, why, who and when the tragedy hit the flight 370? All crises provide new information and knowledge for analysis and futuristic precautions - the learning curve and experience to experts and laymen alike. Agreeably, Malaysian officials will be the net beneficiary of the outcomes, whether the plane dipped into sea, was hit by some unknown mishap or broke apart in the air or was sabotaged by some cruel and sadistic people. The findings and expert conclusions will serve a clear purpose to the grieving relatives and friends of the passengers. Surely, the tragedies and conclusive outcomes assist us to enrich our knowledge, experience and understanding of the unique unthinkable situations which become thinkable and affect our lives. All conflicts and crisis contribute new factors to our knowledge of the known and unknown. They help us to prepare ourselves to deal with future more carefully and with clarity of purpose to find rational answers to mysterious and chaotic developments shaping our world of the known and the unknown. Crises of this nature should enrich our enduring capacity and make us more vigilant, intelligent and powerful to encounter the formidable challenges of human life. Thus, be it the economics, politics and humanitarian causes, we could face them with the power of focused mind and coherent and unified resolve as One Humanity rising above the ugly conflicts of names and fames and working together for the best of living mankind.

The deal is said to be a $1.07 billion all-stock agreement.

The merged company will be called ChiquitaFyffes, with $4.6 billion in annual revenue sales. That would push the newly formed company past Dole Food Company (DOLE) in banana sales.

Shareholders of Chiquita would own more than 50% of the stock, the companies said in a joint statement.

Toyota Motor Corp's Indian unit has declared a lockout of its workers at two car plants after strained salary negotiations spurred workers to stop production lines.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) in a statement said it has locked out workers at the plants near Bangalore since Sunday. It did not state for how long the lockout will continue.

Over the past 25 days, some workers have stopped production lines and disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government failed to reach an agreement over salaries, TKM said.

"The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," TKM said.

Tokyo-based Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino said the unit and union will continue holding talks to resolve the issue. If operations are suspended, that would result in a production loss of 700 vehicles a day, Sumino said.

TKM manufactures vehicles including the Fortuner and Innova at its first plant, where production started in 1997. At the second plant, which opened in 2010, it makes cars including the Etios and Corolla Altis.

Toyota is not the first Japanese car maker to be hit by labour relations troubles in India.

In 2012, Suzuki Motor Corp unit Maruti Suzuki India closed its Manesar plant for a month after a riot that resulted in one death, over 100 injuries and a $250 million production loss.

2015 Mercedes-Benz S500 Plug-In Hybrid

Mercedes-Benz’s latest S-Class will soon be available in hybrid and plug-in hybrid forms , with the latter promising fuel economy of up to 78 mpg when it arrives on the market early next year. However, further down the track we could see a pure electric version of the popular luxury sedan that would compete in a segment that at present is comprised of only the Tesla Model S.

Speaking with the Top Gear website at the recent 2014 Geneva Motor Show, Dr. Uwe Ernstberger, the man in charge of Mercedes’ large car program, said that while there were no plans for an electric S-Class right now, one would be launched in the future.

The key factor holding back Mercedes from launching an electric S-Class are the required batteries.

"We have to work on the capacities of the batteries to get a better package in the car," Ernstberger explained. "You do not want to lose all the comfort features of an S-Class for transporting a battery only.”

Mercedes has demonstrated a major commitment to the electrification of the car, so Ernstberger’s comments about an all-electric S-Class shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. The automaker has already offered an electric car for several years through its Smart brand, and in 2012 we saw it launch the insane SLS AMG Electric Drive. On top of this, an electric B-Class has just been launched and Mercedes has said it was open to working more closely with Tesla, which it has a stake in. _______________________________________

Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.##501|Benghazi (Libya) (AFP) - Libyan authorities said they intercepted a North Korean-flagged tanker Monday which had loaded crude from a rebel-held eastern port, as the conflict over the country's key petroleum revenues escalated.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading the port of Al-Sidra and other key eastern export terminals since July.

But the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday, was the first ship to take on crude from a rebel-held port since the standoff with the central government began.

Officials threatened armed action if necessary to stop it putting to sea and announced that a military task force was being formed to bring the rebel ports back under government control.

"Naval and revolutionary forces are in control of the tanker Morning Glory and are escorting it to a state-controlled port," the country's top legislative and executive body, the General National Congress, said on its website.

But rebel spokesman Ali al-Hassi denied the statement, saying the ship was still in rebel hands at the port, and a spokesman for the Libyan navy, Ayub Omar al-Kassem, said the boat was surrounded by government forces but had not left the port's boundaries.

Oil Minister Omar al-Shakmak had said earlier that the ship had interrupted loading late Sunday and put back to sea.

The 350,000 barrel-capacity vessel had only taken on 234,000 barrels of crude, according to a member of a government crisis team.

Warships had deployed to block the Morning Glory after Culture Minister Amin al-Habib warned on Sunday the tanker would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it tried to leave port.

The defence ministry had also deployed the air force, the official LANA news agency said.

Washington said Sunday it was "deeply concerned" over the loading of the "illicitly obtained" oil.

"This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

"The oil belongs to the (state-run) Libyan National Oil Company and its joint venture partners."

- Breaking the blockades -

Libya's weak central government has struggled to rein in the former rebels who toppled longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a 2011 uprising.

Ex-rebels at Al-Sidra spent the weekend loading oil onto the tanker, ignoring Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's threats to bomb the ship.

It was not the first time that a foreign tanker had tried to dock at a rebel-held terminal but it was the first time that one had taken on oil.

Former rebels have been demanding a return to the autonomy that Cyrenaica enjoyed under the federal constitution that Libya adopted for the first 12 years after independence in 1951.

"We are not demanding the breakup of the country," the head of the federalists' self-declared autonomous government, Abdrabbuh al-Barassi, said Saturday.

"The oil revenues would be split between the three autonomous regions," he said, promising that all sales would be carried out with complete transparency.

The GNC said a task force composed of both regular troops and ex-rebel militia was being formed to bring the rebel ports back under central government control.

The crisis erupted in July, when ex-rebel security guards at key terminals shut them down, accusing the authorities of corruption and demanding a more equitable distribution of oil revenues.

The demands of the protesters swiftly escalated with a call for the eastern Cyrenaica region to be granted autonomy and the right to enjoy the revenues from its own oil exports.

Oil is a key source of revenue for Libya and following the blockade of terminals production plunged from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000.

The central government exerts little control over Libya's east, the cradle of the 2011 uprising, where a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as federalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.

There have been almost daily attacks on security and other government personnel in the region's main towns.##502|The Australian market looks set to open flat after international markets lost ground as investors retreated in the face of concerns about Ukraine, the Chinese economy and falling copper prices.

At 0645 AEDT on Thursday, the March share price index futures contract was down four points at 5,369.

Analysts said falling copper prices had continued the pressure after weak economic data from China.

Copper on Tuesday fell 2.6 per cent.

The fall came a few days after China data showed that the world's second-biggest economy expanded 7.7 per cent last year, the same as in 2012, and the slowest since 1999's 7.6 per cent. It's inflation rate dropped to 2.0 per cent.

It also recorded an unexpected trade deficit of $US22.98 billion ($A25.50 billion) in February, compared to analysts' expectations of a $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Although copper prices have bounced slightly today, the drop through three-year lows yesterday unnerved markets," said Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at trading firm IG.

"Throw in some headlines about Russian movements in Crimea, and you have the recipe for a continuing selloff," he added.

Concern over Russia-Ukraine tension continues with Kremlin-backed forces seizing de facto control of the Crimea peninsula.

In local economic news on Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases February labour force data.

No major equities news is expected.

In Australia, the market on Wednesday closed lower, pulled down by weakness in the major banks, even though some mining stocks bounced back from recent losses.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 29.6 points, or 0.55 per cent, at 5,384.2 points.

The broader All Ordinaries index was down 28.8 points, or 0.53 per cent, at 5,400.5 points.

NEW YORK - For much of Wednesday, the US stock market appeared to be headed for its third decline in three days.

By late afternoon, the market began to slowly pare its losses as investors bought up oil refiners, mining companies and technology stocks.

The push was enough to nudge the Standard & Poor's 500 index into the green by half a point. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also finished higher.

The S&P 500 index added 0.57 points, or 0.03 per cent, to close at 1,868.20. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.17 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,340.08.

The Nasdaq composite rebounded in the early afternoon, gaining 16.14 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 4,323.33.

The three major US stock indexes are still down for the week. Stocks had a strong finish last week, setting three record highs.

Investors have been worried this week about a sharp drop in China's exports in February reported over the weekend, which raised concerns that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

Since China is a big consumer of raw materials and energy, commodities such as copper and iron ore have dropped sharply. Copper has fallen to its lowest level since 2010, but recovered somewhat Wednesday.

A dearth of major US economic news helped dampen trading Wednesday, leaving the market listless.

LONDON - Europe's main stock markets have closed down, with mining shares hit hard by renewed worries over China's economic outlook.

The London's FTSE 100 lost 0.97 per cent to 6,620.9 points on Wednesday, the Dax 30 in Frankfurt slumped 1.28 per cent to 9,188.69 points while Paris's CAC 40 ended the day down 1.0 per cent to 4,306.26 points compared with Tuesday's closing values.

"Equity markets have come under pressure around the world as copper prices continue to fall following weak economic data from China," said Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at trading firm IG.

"Although copper prices have bounced slightly today, the drop through three-year lows yesterday unnerved markets.

"Throw in some headlines about Russian movements in Crimea, and you have the recipe for a continuing selloff," he added.

The euro gained to $US1.3910 from $US1.3863 late in New York the day before.

HONG KONG - Asian markets sank, taking their lead from another selloff on Wall Street, while Tokyo took a hit as the yen climbed against the US dollar with profit-takers moving in following last week's greenback rally.

Despite a small pick-up on Tuesday, regional markets followed Wall Street's cues in the wake of the weekend's worse-than-expected trade and inflation data from China and a downward revision to Japanese economic growth in 2013.

Tokyo tumbled 2.59 per cent, or 393.72 points to finish at 14,830.39 and Sydney fell 0.55 per cent, or 29.6 points, to 5,384.2 while Seoul shed 1.60 per cent, or 31.33 points, to 1,932.54.

Shanghai ended down 0.17 per cent, or 3.47 points, at 1,997.69 and Hong Kong fell 1.65 per cent, or 367.66 points to 21,901.95.

- Forex seasonality over the past 20 years favor a stronger EURUSD in March.

- A better than expected February Nonfarm Payrolls report stunted a potential major EURUSD breakout.

- Have a bullish (or bearish) bias on the Euro, but don’t know which pair to use? Use a Euro currency basket.

The Euro’s resiliency continued to shine this week as a bout of mixed economic data took a backseat to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. On a cooling of tensions in Eastern Europe and seemingly diminished outcome of military conflict, the higher yielding currencies led the pack as risk appetite surged: the EURAUD depreciated by -1.08% and the EURNZD eased by -0.38%. The Euro’s strength came through in the last two days of the week, and its gains elsewhere are constructive going forward.

While the ECB’s meeting on Thursday helped the Euro realize its pent up bullish potential, it may have just paved the way for further gains over the coming months. The window in which to ease further may be closing, and as a result, the door to a period of monetary stability may have been opened.

As ECB President Mario Draghi made clear in the press conference on Thursday, the ECB does not want to simply just inject more liquidity into the Euro-Zone banking system; there is little need right now. Interbank lending rates (EONIA) are stable below the ECB’s overnight reference rate of 0.25%, which means funding stresses are low. Sovereign yields are stable at multi-year lows (bond prices at highs) and equity markets are buoyed; the linkages between the Euro-Zone banking system and her sovereigns are being strained.

With the PMI surveys pointing to continued modest growth and Euro-Zone inflation starting to tick higher, any new non-standard dovish policies could send the wrong signal as the ECB undertakes role as supervisor of the Euro-Zone banking system; economic data has been generally improved recently, even consumption. As the ECB prepares its stress tests (AQR), announcing a liquidity injections before the results come out might signal to the market that the ECB discovered something unknown and materially negative once they began to review banks' balance sheets.

Instead, so as to prevent unnecessary confusion about the health of the banking system, the ECB is stuck in neutral. To be clear: the ECB stands ready to act if necessary, and quite frankly, it seems that the Governing Council would like to do more. But at present time, short-term economic momentum doesn’t dictate that necessity. This is not inaction; this is a deliberate attempt to do nothing and see where the chips fall. Only if data falls back will the ECB act – crisis conditions don’t exist.

Eventually, a BoE-styled Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) seems like the most palatable outcome for the market is crisis conditions remain absent. This could address credit concerns at the consumer and small business level (SMEs), and it wouldn’t put the Euro at risk of a massive ECB balance sheet expansion that another LTRO or a Fed-styled QE would bring (this would please the German influence). For now, data needs to remain sturdy as the door remains open for further Euro gains. – CV

The U.S. Attorney’s office in New York has opened a criminal investigation into General Motors to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing on the part of GM stemming from the automaker’s faulty ignition switch recall last month

The Justice Department is reportedly looking to whether General Motors broke any laws in the recall stemming from an ignition switch, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.

The FBI has joined federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York in the probe.

General Motors announced Wednesday that it is offering free loaner cars and $500 toward a new GM vehicle to more than a million owners of the compact cars that are being recalled. At least 13 people have died in accidents linked to the ignition-switch defect. CBS News’ reporting showed GM was aware of the problem years before the recall. On Tuesday, a congressional committee opened an investigation.##509|Empty##510|Empty##511|Empty##512|Editor's note: This story has been updated to include comment from Access Health CT

Though Connecticut's health insurance exchange has been held up as a national example of enrollment success, its offerings are less competitive than those in other states, according to a study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

Using an index that measures how evenly market share is distributed, Kaiser determined that Connecticut's individual exchange insurance plans are 68 percent less competitive than they were in 2012, prior to the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Compared to the five insurers offering plans in Connecticut's individual market in 2012, there are just three participating in Access Health CT, which runs the exchange.

Of the three insurers that did participate, Anthem/Wellpoint and Connecticare/EmblemHealth both saw their respective market shares jump to 60 percent and 37 percent, up from 45 percent and 8 percent in the individual market of 2012. Meanwhile, nonprofit insurer HealthyCT brings up the rear with 3 percent market share.

Major players Aetna and United Healthcare decided not to participate in the inaugural round of the individual exchange.

Competition was more spread out in the individual market, when four insurers had market shares of 5 percent or more. The exchange has just two.



Kevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health, said in a statement that despite having three plans, the exchange provides a range of price and benefit choices.

"As health reform matures nationally, we expect many states, including CT, to offer more health plan choices and thus more value to our enrollees," Counihan said.

Kaiser analyzed seven states that had release market-share data as of Feb. 18. It found New York and California to be the most competitive.##513|Empty##514|0317alibaba

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed flat at 1,320.58 points as the ongoing crisis in Ukraine --which has dogged bourses on the continent for the past week -- continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

The basic resources sector was one of the standout gainers on Tuesday, after heavy selling on Monday. Rio Tinto and Lonmin all traded higher, after Chinese mainland shares broke into positive territory. Lonmin was also boosted by a favorable upgrade by Goldman Sachs, closing 0.9 percent higher.



U.S. stocks wavered between small gains and losses on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 not far from its all-time high.

Ukraine crisis rumbles on

In Ukraine, ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich insisted Tuesday he remained the country's legitimate president and commander-in-chief, saying he would return to Kiev and appeal to the armed forces to defy any "criminal orders" handed down by his foes.

He made his remarks after Ukraine's acting president told parliament of plans to raise a new national guard to protect against internal and external threats.

German trade data surges

On the data front, both German exports and imports surged in January, according to figures from the Federal Statistics Office. The seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 17.2 billion euros ($32.8 billion), from 18.3 billion euros in December.

The DAX closed higher by around 0.3 percent on Tuesday, having fallen 2.9 percent in the previous two sessions.

Elsewhere, Italy's largest bank by assets, UniCredit, posted a 14 billion-euro ($19 billion) loss for 2013 after huge writedowns on acquisitions and bad loans, as it attempted to clean up its balance sheet ahead of a sector-wide health check by European regulators.

However, shares in the bank provisionally closed up by 6.2 percent as the bank said it did not need to raise capital and investors responded positively to efforts to tidy up its balance sheet.

In Italy there was more positive data on Tuesday, after fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.1 percent from the third, in line with expectations by analysts in a Reuters poll. This followed yesterday's numbers, which showed Italian industrial output — on a seasonally adjusted basis — had risen 1 percent in January, beating estimates of a 0.4 percent rise.

Portugal's growth figures beat estimates, with GDP growth of 0.6 percent in the last quarter. Portuguese stocks posted solid gains after the news with the PSI 20 Index higher by 0.7 percent.



The Italian FTSE MIB closed up 0.4 percent, while the Portuguese PSI 20 index closed higher by 0.9 percent.##516|Urban Outfitters, Inc., a lifestyle products and services company, engages in the retail and wholesale of general consumer products.

DATE LAST MODIFIED: May 18, 2018##518|Mortgage rates forecast for October 2018

Mortgage rate trends are inherently unpredictable — right up there with economic recessions and stock prices.

But even non-experts could do a pretty good job guessing where mortgage rates will go for the rest of the year.

With a hot economy, an active Federal Reserve, and inflation starting to tick up, mortgage rates would have a really hard time going down.

The best we can hope for is that they stay where they are long enough for homebuyers and refinance candidates to lock in.

Luckily, 30-year fixed rates are still in the 4s. This was considered an impossible range just a few years ago. Despite incessant rate increases, these rates are somehow still available.

Don’t want a rate over 5%? Now could be the time to act.

Predictions for October and the rest of 2018

There is no shortage of market-moving news in October. Developments now will impact your ability to buy or refinance this month and in the remainder of the year.

Rates forecast at the beginning of the year has pretty much come true. Most major housing and financial authorities predicted rates somewhere between 4.7% and 5.0% for 2018.

According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed rate for an ideal candidate jumped to 4.72% at the end of September. That’s very close to the rough 4.75% rate you get when you average predictions from seven agencies like Realtor.com and the National Association of Home Builders.

The good news is that we are not very likely to see any more huge jumps for the remainder of the year if forecasts are accurate.

But, we are very likely to see a gradual increase until January 2019, starting the year in the high 4s.

Been looking for a good rate on a refinance or home purchase? Now might be the time to lock.

The economy appears unstoppable, and that’s bad for rates

A hot economy is an enemy to low rates, and there’s little doubt we’re in a hot economy.

The unemployment rate is at 3.9%, considered very low. There is now less than one unemployed worker for every available job. Yep, there are now more jobs than workers to fill them.

Compare that with 2009, when there were more than 6 unemployed workers for every available job.

It’s a “workers market,” and that’s good for people in general, because — just taking a wild guess here — most of us would rather have income than an ultra-low mortgage rate.

But it’s not so good for those looking to buy or refinance.

Inflation is bad for mortgage rates. The simple equation emerges: hot economy = inflation = higher mortgage rates

This worker shortage will eventually lead to inflation as companies pay more to hire and retain workers. These firms then pass on those costs via higher priced products.

Higher prices for goods and services is the very definition of inflation.

Inflation is bad for mortgage rates. The simple equation emerges:

Hot economy = inflation = higher mortgage rates

So what’s a home mortgage shopper to do? Simply lock in as soon as you can. We won’t be getting off this economic tour de force for a while.

The Fed just hiked rates, and will again in December

The most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (aka “The Fed”) just ended September 26. As everyone expected, the group hiked its benchmark federal funds rate.

While the action didn’t directly affect mortgage rates, it did lend to an overall environment of rising rates, which certainly doesn’t help the mortgage rate shopper.

And, expect another rate hike in December. Twelve of the 16 Fed meeting participants predict one more hike in 2018. That would make a total of four rate increases this year.

Those who are waiting for rates to go down may be sadly disappointed in 2018.

However, for those who are willing to wait a bit, many experts are predicting a recession in 2020. Half the economists surveyed in a recent poll by the National Association of Business Economics indicate an oncoming recession.

An economic pull-back could prompt the Fed to lower the fed funds rate. The Fed could even make mortgage rates artificially low like it did in the wake of the 2008 crisis.

(Many economists believe that the Fed is hiking rates now partially because it needs to cut them if the economy turns south.)

For homeowners who just want to refinance, a 2020 rate drop might be worth waiting for. But for a homebuyer, it could backfire. Home prices could be 10 to 20 percent higher by then, negating any rate savings.

Think you’ll be buying in the next couple of years? Today’s rates may be the best we see.

Mortgage rate trends for the rest of 2018 and 2019

Mortgage rates have already surpassed predictions cast by major housing agencies. Now, the question is, what are these groups forecasting for the remainder of the year?

Agency 2018 Prediction 2019 Prediction Mortgage Bankers Association 4.7% 5.2% Freddie Mac 4.5% 5.1% Fannie Mae 4.6% 4.7% Realtor.com 5.0% No forecast National Association of Realtors 4.6% 5.0% Kiplinger 4.8% No forecast National Association of Home Builders 4.53% 4.88%

To sum it up, everyone is predicting higher rates. Today’s rate might be as good as we’ll see for years to come.

Advice for October 2018

Knowing what will happen in October is only half the battle. As a mortgage rate shopper, now you need to know the best actions to take this month.

Don’t automatically dismiss a cash-out refinance

Homeowners have racked up a monumental amount of home equity in recent years. According to statistics site Statista, U.S. homeowners are sitting on more than $14 trillion in equity.

But they are struggling with how to tap into that equity.

A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is fast, convenient, and comes with low closing costs. Most importantly, you don’t have to touch your first mortgage to get one.

A cash-out refinance, though, replaces your first mortgage and gives you cash back for the new loan amount that exceeds your old one. That gives you a potentially higher rate, plus additional closing costs.

But a cash-out refi limits your exposure to a Federal Reserve that is determined to raise rates. Home equity rates are adjustable and rise every time the Fed hikes rates. A 30-year fixed cash-out loan payment never changes.

Consider a scenario where a homeowner needs $50,000 cash. Shortly after taking the HELOC, the Fed hikes rates to 2007 levels.

Cash-out Refi HELOC at 9% HELOC – 10 Yr Payoff First Mortgage $273,000 $220,000 $220,000 HELOC N/A $50,500 $50,500 1st Mortgage Payment $1,420 (@4.75%) $1,200 (@3.75%) $1,200 (@3.75%) HELOC Payment N/A $380 (@9% interest only payment) $680 (@9%, fully amortized 10-yr period) Total Mortgage Payment $1,420 $1,580 $1,880

To make matters worse, HELOCs eventually turn into “fully amortizing” loans. When they begin, they often require that only interest is paid.

The principal-plus-interest payment at 9% gets pretty steep.

But with a cash-out loan, you avoid that risk. You lock in at a certain rate and stay there as long as you keep the loan.

So, a HELOC may not be the best home equity tool, after all.

Loan product rate updates

Many mortgage shoppers don’t realize there are many different types of mortgage rates. But this knowledge can help home buyers and refinancing households find the best value for their situation.

Following are updates for specific loan types and their corresponding rates.

Conventional loan rates

Conventional refinance rates and those for home purchases are still low despite recent increases.

According to loan software company Ellie Mae, the 30-year mortgage rate averaged 4.94% in August, the most recent data available.

This is slightly higher than Freddie Mac’s 4.72% average because it factors in low credit and low-down-payment conventional loan closings, which tend to come with higher rates.

Lower credit score borrowers can use conventional loans, but these loans are more suited for those with decent credit and at least 3% down. Five percent down is preferable due to higher rates that come with lower down payments.

Twenty percent of equity is preferred when refinancing.

With adequate equity in the home, a conventional refinance can pay off any loan type. Got an Alt-A, subprime, or high-PMI loan? A conventional refi can take care of it.

For instance, say you purchased a home three years ago with an FHA loan at 3.5% down. Since then, home values have skyrocketed.

You refinance into a conventional loan (because you now have 20% equity) and eliminate FHA mortgage insurance.

This could be a savings of hundreds of dollars per month, even if your interest rate goes up.

FHA is currently the go-to program for home buyers who may not qualify for conventional loans.

The good news is that you will get a similar rate — or even lower one — with an FHA loan than you will with conventional.

According to loan software company Ellie Mae, which processes more than 3 million loans per year, FHA loan rates averaged 4.95% in August, while conventional loans averaged 4.94%.

Another interesting stat from Ellie Mae: About 30% of all FHA loans are issued to applicants with scores below 650.

FHA loans come with mortgage insurance. But overall cost is not much more than for conventional loans.

A little-known program, called the FHA streamline refinance, lets you convert your current FHA loan into a new one at a lower rate if rates are now lower.

An FHA streamline requires no W2s, pay stubs, or tax returns. And you don’t need an appraisal, so home value doesn’t matter.

VA mortgage rates

Homeowners with a VA loan currently are eligible for the ever-popular VA streamline refinance.

No income, asset, or appraisal documentation is required.

If you’ve experienced a loss of income or diminished savings, a VA streamline can get you into a lower rate and better financial situation. This is true even when you wouldn’t qualify for a standard refinance.

But don’t overlook the VA loan for home buying. It requires zero down payment. That means if you have the cash for closing costs, or can get them paid for by the seller, you can buy a home without raising any additional funds.

“Don’t overlook the VA loan for home buying. It requires zero down payment.”

VA mortgages are offered by local and national lenders, not by the government directly.

This public-private partnership gives consumers the best of both worlds: strong government backing and the convenience and speed of a private company.

Most lenders will accept scores down to 620, or even lower. Plus, you don’t pay high interest rates for low scores.

Quite the contrary, VA loans come with the lowest rates of all loan types according to Ellie Mae. In August, 30-year VA mortgage rates averaged just 4.74% while conventional loans averaged 4.94%

There’s incredible value in VA loans.

USDA mortgage rates

Like FHA and VA, current USDA loan holders can refinance via a “streamlined” process.

With the USDA streamline refinance, you don’t need a new appraisal. You don’t even have to qualify using your current income. The lender will only make sure that you are still within USDA income limits.

More about the USDA streamline refinance.

Home buyers are also learning the benefits of the USDA loan program for home buying.

No down payment is required, and rates are ultra-low.

Home payments can be even lower than rent payments, as this USDA loan calculator shows.

Qualification is easier because the government wants to spur homeownership in rural areas. Home buyers might qualify even if they’ve been turned down for another loan type in the past.

There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.##520|The first Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting chaired by Janet Yellen will reduce the Fed’s monthly pace of asset purchases by another $10 billion, economists project.

During the two-day meeting that concludes Wednesday, Yellen may also engineer a change in how the Fed guides markets on possible changes in interest rates — away from numerical goals for employment and inflation and toward less-specific signals.

Editor’s Note:

250% Gains Bagged Using Secret Calendar (See Video)

The Fed meeting, and Yellen’s press conference at its conclusion, is the highlight of a relatively light week on the global economic calendar.

Elsewhere, central banks in Switzerland and Mexico will probably hold the line on borrowing costs. In the U.K., a midweek report is forecast to show the unemployment rate held at 7.2 percent.

FEDERAL RESERVE

— Members of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting Tuesday and Wednesday will reduce monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by a combined $10 billion to $55 billion, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Of particular interest to investors will be whether the Fed moves away from numerical thresholds and toward qualitative guidance on the conditions that would prompt the Fed to increase its benchmark interest rate above zero, where it has been since December 2008. Yellen told lawmakers on Feb. 27 that the Fed is moving in that direction now that unemployment is close to the central bank’s 6.5 percent marker. The rate was at 6.7 percent in February.

— “We believe Ms. Yellen would support dropping the numerical 6.5 percent unemployment forward-guidance threshold, and replacing it with a broader range of employment indicators that describe labor-market slack and the Fed’s progress towards meeting its employment mandate,” Michael Carey, chief economist at Credit Agricole in New York, wrote in a weekly research note.

— A change to qualitative guidance “still points to a ‘low for longer’ fed-funds policy stance,” Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at HSBC Securities USA Inc. in New York, wrote in a note. “There is a possibility that forward guidance from a low fed funds rate could be strengthened with a statement about ‘gradual’ changes” in the rate after the first increase takes place.

U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT

— Britain’s jobless rate probably held at 7.2 percent in the three months through January, above the 7 percent threshold Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has set as the level to begin considering interest-rate increases. Even when the threshold is reached, he’s given himself breathing room by saying there’s scope to wait past that point to absorb spare capacity before tightening. The data are due Wednesday, the same time the BOE publishes the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s meeting earlier this month.

— “The MPC is not taking the recovery for granted and wants to see it become more balanced, with business investment seeing sustained improvement and exports increasingly kicking in,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London. “Extended low interest rates will hopefully facilitate this process.”

U.K. BUDGET

— Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will take to the floor of Parliament the same day to lay out his spending and tax plans for the coming fiscal year. With the economy recovering, he can use the stronger growth to rebuff opposition calls for him to rethink his fiscal squeeze as he looks ahead to the general election in 2015.

— “The U.K.’s fiscal position remains poor in absolute terms, but there appears to be sufficient progress in reducing the deficit to prevent any adverse market reaction,” said Ross Walker, senior economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “Political risk remains, but it is more likely to surface closer to — and beyond — the 2015 election.”

SWISS NATIONAL BANK

— The Swiss National Bank’s three-member governing board will announce Thursday its latest policy decision. It will leave the benchmark interest rate at zero and maintain its cap on the franc, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The cap, introduced in 2011 to keep the franc from strengthening and to guard against deflation, will remain in place for some time, another poll shows.

— “Our official forecasts go until end 2015,” said Reto Huenerwadel, senior economist at UBS AG in Zurich. “We are not looking for a change in the franc cap until then.”

MEXICAN INTEREST RATES

— Mexico’s central bank on Friday probably will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the third straight meeting, leaving it at 3.5 percent as policy makers confront above-target inflation and a slowdown in economic growth last quarter.

— “The board will decide to remain on hold, but highlighting that the economy remains weak,” Marco Oviedo, Barclays Plc’s chief Mexico economist, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “I expect a very dovish tone” in the statement accompanying the decision.

— The central bank “will probably soften its hawkish rhetoric adopted back at its January meeting,” Gabriel Casillas, the chief economist and head of research at Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The economic deceleration that characterized 2013 seems to be extending into the first quarter.” Banorte forecasts “an indefinite pause” in changes to the overnight rate, he said.

250% Gains Bagged Using Secret Calendar (See Video)##521|WASHINGTON | The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts. Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen's first news conference as Fed chair.

The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.

Will Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke's approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed's economic stimulus?

Or, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?

No major announcements are expected when the meeting ends Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.

The Fed's most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows "well past" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5 percent threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.

Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there's "not a large expectation" that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.

One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they're no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.

"There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate."

Yellen, who was sworn as chair Feb. 3, has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That's partly why the Fed will likely announce this week a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage spending and growth.

In December and in January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. If the economy keeps improving, the Fed will likely keep paring its bond purchases until ending them altogether in December.

The pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that's depressed growth, to fears about how Russia's aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.

Still, Fed officials, including Yellen, have signaled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign the economy is losing momentum.

The Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth in 2014.

Many think the economy, which grew a lackluster 1.9 percent in 2013, will rebound to around 3 percent this year.

"We had a tough start to the year with the winter storms, but it looks like we are starting to pull out of those weather effects," said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.

Economists point to several hopeful signs — from a rebound in retail sales to an increase of 175,000 jobs in February despite continued harsh weather.

Even if the economy strengthens and the Fed ends its bond purchases late this year, it will still be stimulating the economy.

It has no plans to start selling its enormous portfolio of bonds — a step that would likely send loan rates up. Nor is it likely this year to raise the benchmark short-term rate it controls.

More than five years ago, the Fed cut that rate to a record low near zero, where it's remained since.

Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until late 2015.##522|Advanced Search

Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose for the second consecutive session Tuesday.



The most active gold contract for April delivery rose 5.2 US dollars, or 0.39 percent, to settle at 1,346.7 dollars per ounce.



Worries over Ukraine and concerns about economic slowdown in China have boosted the safe-haven appeal of gold.



In the meantime, gold exchange-traded funds have seen a capital flow reversal, from outflows last year to inflows this year, which indicates that investors have begun to buy gold again.



Demand for gold from Asia, from China in particular, remaining at record or near-record levels from the start of this year also supported gold.



Investors were now waiting to see how economic figures to be released this week will impact the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on March 19.



Silver for May delivery lost 9.5 cents, or 0.45 percent, to close at 20.815 dollars per ounce. Platinum for April delivery slipped 12.6 dollars, or 0.85 percent, to close at 1,464.6 dollars per ounce.

##524|* Bouygues raises cash part of SFR bid by 800 mln euros

* Numericable improves its bid - sources

* Vivendi board meeting set for Friday (Adds Numericable improved bid, analyst comments, shares)

By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Sophie Sassard and Leila Abboud

PARIS, March 13 (Reuters) - French groups Bouygues and Numericable have both improved the terms of their bids for Vivendi’s telecoms unit SFR, ahead of a decision by the seller on Friday that will reshape the country’s mobile industry.

Construction-to-telecoms conglomerate Bouygues said on Thursday it would raise the cash portion of its bid to 11.3 billion euros ($15.7 billion) from 10.5 billion, while cutting the stake Vivendi would be left with in a combined SFR-Bouygues to 43 percent from 46 percent.

Cable firm Numericable also improved its offer, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.

Three other people close to the situation, but without direct knowledge of the Numericable bid, said they had learned that the company had raised the cash portion of its bid by as much as 850 million euros.

Numericable, whose previous bid was 10.9 billion euros in cash and a 32 percent stake in the combined group, declined to comment. Vivendi also declined to comment.

The jockeying shows how Vivendi’s hand has strengthened in recent weeks as SFR’s suitors circle. The conglomerate had planned to spin off SFR this summer as part of two-year effort to exit telecoms and focus on its media businesses.

Both deals would change the landscape in Europe’s third-biggest telecom market that has been in a price war since low-cost operator Iliad entered the mobile arena in 2012.

A Numericable win would create a major player in fixed broadband, while victory for Bouygues would cut the number of mobile operators to three from four, potentially leading to price rises.

Vivendi’s board will meet on Friday morning to debate the two bids, as well as the spin off option.

Before the new bids, the race was “very close” and internal talks were ongoing, Vivendi insiders had said.

CRUCIAL FACTORS

The amount of cash offered by the buyers and Vivendi’s ability to make a quicker and more complete exit from SFR are crucial factors in the bid battle, according to people familiar with the situation.

A tie-up with Bouygues would slow Vivendi’s departure from telecoms somewhat because the regulatory review would be longer than that for Numericable, since the latter is not a big player in mobile.

Also, Bouygues needs to do an initial public offering (IPO) of the new company - aiming for mid-2015 - before Vivendi could sell its remaining stake on the open market, whereas Numericable shares are already floated.

Political factors could also intrude since the French government has already said it would monitor the SFR sale to ensure that jobs were protected and operators kept their promises to invest in high-speed broadband.

Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg has declared publicly that he prefers the Bouygues bid because it would calm what he called “destructive competition” in France.

In a statement on Thursday, Bouygues said it was “committed to facilitate the liquidity of Vivendi’s interest in the new entity.” A spokesman said that meant Vivendi might be allowed to sell part of its 43 percent stake to financial investors before a new Bouygues-SFR was launched on the stock market in an IPO.

Vivendi’s right to sell 15 percent at IPO - as outlined in its original offer - was unchanged. Taken together, the various measures offered by Bouygues would allow Vivendi to sell down its entire SFR stake within three years, said the spokesman.

Patrick Drahi, entrepreneur and founder of Numericable, had said in an interview published on Wednesday that he would not change his offer for SFR.

Numericable shares were up almost 7 percent at 1422 GMT, while Bouygues’ were largely flat, and Vivendi’s down 1 percent.

Yves Marcais, a broker at Global Equities, said he expected Vivendi to weigh the bids objectively, adding Vincent Bollore, the group’s vice-chairman and second-largest shareholder, would likely have a big influence on the decision.

“Bollore is a practical man and he will not hesitate to choose the best solution on the financial front,” Marcais said.##525|Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and heading toward Beijing on the morning of March 8, but lost contact with air traffic control an hour later and disappeared off the radar.

No trace of the plane and the 239 people on board have been found and few details about what could have happened to the plane have been released.

Here's what we know now as of now about the investigation into missing flight MH370.

Check out ABC News' photos of the search for the flight here, too.





Flight MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, headed for Beijing, China, around 12:41 a.m. local time on Saturday. It showed up on radar two minutes later.

Malaysia's radar tracked flight MH370 until 1:20 a.m. when the flight dropped off the radar. At the time the plane was on its route over the South China Sea heading for the southern tip of Vietnam. An air traffic controller told the plane's captain he was about to be handed over to air traffic control out of Ho Chi Minh City. The pilot responded, “All right, good night.” Authorities initially said this was the last time they had contact with the flight.

Authorities have discovered that a flight showed up on the country's military defense radar at 2:15 a.m. local time in the Straits of Malacca, hundreds of miles due west of their last contact point and far from its route to Beijing. They said today that contact could possibly have been MH370.



The military radar also showed something make a turn back, meaning some aircraft reversing course, but they are not sure whether it was flight MH370. Because of the uncertain radar data, they are not sure of the plane's last position.

The engines on the plane, manufactured by Rolls Royce, are designed to send pulses of data at certain stages of the flight. Malaysian authorities said today they are working with Rolls Royce to determine what data MH370's engines sent before it went missing.





An oil rig worker stationed off the coast of Vietnam reported seeing a burning object fall into the ocean early Saturday, which could help show a fiery crash doomed the plane. The worker, a New Zealand resident, wrote an email to Vietnamese authorities explaining what he saw.

Vietnamese authorities said today they searched the area and did not see any evidence of a crash or debris.

Authorities in Malaysia said today they will "not reduce the tempo" and "not spare any effort" in searching for signs of the plane after five days without any hard evidence of what could have happened to Flight 370.

The search has been broadened to encompass 27,000 square nautical miles, an area roughly the size of Indiana.



Forty-two ships and 39 aircraft from 12 countries are scanning the area in the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea where the plane is last thought to have traveled.



Despite reports, there have been no plane parts or signs of passengers found.





Aviation experts say there are two possible causes of the disappearance: mechanical error or human error on board, which could include an electrical outage, a fire, a hijacking or bomb, and many other reasons. There is no hard evidence one way or another at his point, they say.

The transponders on board the plane that transmit signal's about the plane's location were somehow disabled or turned off, according to authorities. Investigators are looking at how and why they transponders were not functioning.

Authorities have not ruled out terrorism but have found no evidence of it.

Malaysian government officials today played a recording of the pilot's last recorded words for passengers' family members. The air traffic control worker said to the pilot, "We have to hand you over to Ho Chi Minh City," to which the pilot replied, "All right, goodnight."





Four passengers who were waiting on the stand-by list to board flight MH370 were given seats on the plane after four ticketed passengers did not show up for the flight.

239 people were on board the flight, made up of 227 passengers (including one infant and one toddler) and 12 crew members.

Three Americans, including two children, are among the missing. Philip Wood, 50, an IBM executive, had just come from Texas where he was visiting family on his way to Beijing.

Fourteen nationalities were on board, though 152 passengers were Chinese.

Twenty passengers on the plane worked for the Austin, Texas, company Freescale Semiconductor. Another passenger, Chng Mei Ling, worked as an engineer for the Pennsylvania company Flexsys America LP.

Pilot Zahari Ahmad Shah, 53, was a veteran pilot who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had over 18,000 flying hours.





Investigators discovered that two passengers used stolen passports, one from Austria and one from Italy, to board the flight.

Interpol identified the two as Iranians Seyed Mohammad Reza Delavar, 29, and Pouria Nourmohammadi, 18, and said they have no known links to militant groups, downplaying the possibility they were terrorists.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of sentiment fell to 79.9 this month from 81.6 in February. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for the measure to increase to 82.

Consumers surveyed were more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy, indicating bigger payroll gains that lead to faster wage growth are needed to propel spending. At the same time, fewer job cuts, higher home values and stocks close to a record will help keep sentiment from faltering.

"The winter weather is not a reason to get rosy about the economy or personal finances, so we're seeing consumers hold here," said Sean Incremona, a senior economist at 4cast Inc. in New York, who projected a decline in the gauge to 80.5. "The job market should continue to improve, albeit at a moderate pace, and we hope eventually we will see increased wages, which will be the real factor to drive spending and sentiment."

The index averaged 89 in the five years before December 2007, when the last recession began, and 64.2 in the 18-month contraction that followed.

Producer Prices

Another report Friday showed inflation at the producer level cooled last month. The Labor Department's producer-price index decreased unexpectedly by 0.1 percent in February, after a 0.2 percent advance, as the cost of services fell by the most in almost a year.

The Michigan survey's index of expectations six months from now decreased to 69.4, the lowest since November, from 72.7 last month. The gauge of current conditions, which measures Americans' view of their personal finances, rose to 96.1 in March from 95.4 in February.

Payrolls expanded by 175,000 workers in February after a 129,000 gain in the prior month, the Labor Department reported on March 7. The jobless rate, however, rose to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent as the number of people entering the job market swamped the quantity of positions available.

Worker pay is also showing signs of picking up. Hourly wages for all workers climbed 0.4 percent, on average, to $24.31 last month, marking the biggest gain since June, the Labor Department's figures showed. Average weekly pay increased to $831.40 from $830.75.##528|Empty##529|Empty##530|Why did this happen?

On the economic front, a report released by Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that Chinese exports declined 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports. Consequently, the trade balance turned to a deficit of $22.98 billion from a surplus of $31.86 billion last5 year. The combined data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.

Separate data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual consumer price inflation in Chine eased to 2 percent in February from 2.5 percent in January, with the drop coming in line with estimates.

Final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office reported that Japan's fourth quarter GDP was downwardly revised to 0.2 percent quarter-over-quarter from the 0.3 percent estimated earlier. The downward revision was in line with estimates.

For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com##533|As the "Candy Crush" developer heads to the IPO counter, some wonder if it has what it takes to keep momentum going.

King Digital Entertainment created the undisputed champion of games last year with the highly addictive, virtual, sugar-filled game "Candy Crush." Players number 97 million everyday, which is helping to lead King to the IPO counter later this month.

At the time of the public offering, King expects to be valued at about $7.6 billion, with shares pricing between $21 and $24 per share.

"The valuation is hard to argue when you look at the numbers," said Brian Blair, principal at Wedge Partners. " 'Candy Crush' was a top three game last year and in nearly every geography that had an iPhone app store. Universal appeal and distribution like that is hard to find," he said.

While the company offers 180 other games, it's "Candy Crush" which brings in three-quarters of its revenue. So what happens when players get tired of "Candy Crush"?

Take a look at rival Zynga 's stock price, which has been cut in half since its 2011 IPO as the popularity of its own game "Farmville" fell by the wayside.

"As Rovio has done with 'Angry Birds,' there are many ways to milk a franchise. We've seen this in the console gaming world too with numerous iterations of 'Call of Duty' or the Tony Hawk franchise. So 'Candy Crush' will have a long tail, but investors will want to see new titles and franchises emerge," Blair said.

King is scheduled to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.

Tensions over Ukraine continued to build and with diplomacy at a standstill, European Union governments said they were considering sanctions against Russia if it failed to respond positively to an initiative to calm the crisis.

The Ukraine crisis sapped appetite for risk and weighed on U.S. equities, which also boosted gold demand.

The precious metal also climbed after China’s data showed exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the world’s second-largest economy.

However, analysts warned of possible gold losses if geopolitical tensions ease and U.S. economy recovers.

“If the Russian situation can be contained and U.S. data continues to hold in, gold will turn into an excellent short opportunity once again, with specs likely to flip back from long to short quite quickly,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.

Spot gold was up 0.7 percent at $1,346.70 an ounce by 2:35 p.m. EDT (1835 GMT), having earlier reached $1,352.50, near a four-month high.

U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $5.20 at $1,346.70 an ounce, with volume about 10 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.

The confrontation around the Black Sea peninsula showed no sign of easing on Tuesday, a day after pro-Russian forces opened fire in seizing a Ukrainian military base in Crimea and NATO announced reconnaissance flights along its eastern frontiers.

“There is still a good deal of safe-haven bidding in the market on Ukraine and any possible Russian response, and that’s helping get beyond that crucial $1,350 technical and psychological level,” Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said.

In a sign confidence in the precious metal may be returning amid global uncertainties, the world’s biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD.P) said holdings rose 7.50 tonnes to 812.70 tonnes on Monday, the biggest inflow since February 13.

VIDEO )##538|Empty##539|Kuala Lumpur/Beijing, March 17: Multinational search operations for the Malaysian airliner that went missing March 8 continued Monday in the Indian Ocean but there is no trace of the aircraft.

Australian Defence Minister David Johnston said his country would do what it could to assist Malaysia to locate flight MH370 in whatever state it was in, Xinhua reported.

“We are now changing our focus to the central eastern Indian Ocean to try to solve this mystery,” he said. Australia has provided two RAAF P-3C Orion aircraft to assist the Malaysian government in its search since March 9.

Malaysia Airlines MH370 with 239 passengers and crew on board vanished mysteriously about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur early March 8.

The Boeing 777-200ER was initially presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast in the South China Sea. The plane was due to land in Beijing at 6.30 a.m. the same day. The 227 passengers included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians. Contact with the plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1.40 a.m. March 8 when it was flying over the air traffic control area of Ho Chi Minh City.

Johnston confirmed Australian aircraft were being directed by the Royal Malaysian Air Force commander for the western region search area and information on the search would be directed to the Malaysian authorities. One RAAF P-3C Orion started searching in the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands and the other would continue to search west of Malaysia.

France, which experienced its own search for a missing plane when an Air France flight disappeared off the coast of Brazil in 2009, has also confirmed its assistance, with the assignment of four experts. India has supported search operations in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal but this was suspended Sunday at the request of Kuala Lumpur.

The Indian defence ministry said the search would remain suspended until notice by Malaysia on which areas to search. Malaysian authorities confirmed the pilot of the aircraft spoke to air traffic control after a signaling system was disabled on the jet, without referring to any trouble. This comes as speculation grows about possible pilot complicity and a possible hijacking. Malaysian Prime Minister Razak Sunday hinted at foul play, saying someone probably deliberately diverted the plane from its flight path from Kuala Lampur to Beijing.##540|Precious-Gold rose for a second day on Wednesday, hovering around 19-week high, as escalating geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine and drop in equity markets spurred haven demand on the metal.

Russian forces strengthened their grip over Crimea, causing Ukraine to call for Western relief on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea.

The EU is prepared to impose sanctions on Russia for violating the international law, following a referendum in Crimea on March 16 that would decide on splitting from Ukraine and joining Russia.

On the other hand, worries from China slowdown after the unexpected in exports in February have added to worries.

U.S. shares dropped on Tuesday closing, where S&P lost 0.5 percent to 1,867.62 and Dow Jones dipped 0.4 percent to 16,351.25.

With the absence of economic data from the United States, investors are focusing more on political events. However, they remain cautious after last week’s nonfarm payrolls data has raised speculations the Fed would continue with their stimulus reduction plan.

Expectations are in favor of seeing further bond-purchases cut by slashing another $10 billion to $55 billion during the March 18-19 Fed meeting.

The yellow metal, however, is still moving in a narrow range, as investors are holding their buy or sell decision until the Fed’s coming meeting.

Meanwhile, the yellow metal is trading around $1356.47 an ounce after hitting a high of $1362.57 and a low of $1345.29.

So far, the yellow metal has gained 13 percent this year after dropping 28 percent in 2013.

"There are vulnerabilities within Russia that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] has politically that can be exploited," the Wisconsin Republican told CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "I think we should consider targeting some of the oligarchs around him that are his enablers and he is their enablers."

Ryan suggested imposing travel bans and economic sanctions against Putin's wealthy domestic allies, including targeting overseas holdings "that are illicitly gained through this kleptocracy of the Russian economy."

Ryan also urged the Obama administration to expand natural gas exports to Europe to help the continent become less dependent on Russian gas and oil -- a significant part of Russia's economy.

"We are a nation with vast energy reserves and potential, but with a government that is seen as hostile toward developing those energy reserves, let alone exporting those energy reserves," Ryan said.

"If our government changed its tune on that, if we told Europe we are going to green-light these languishing [natural gas] permit applications for exporting … to Europe, that could do a lot to send the signals that we are intent on loosening Russian's grip on its energy to Europe and that we're going to be a reliable ally to loosen their grip."

He said the House will move forward on legislation to expedite the permitting process for U.S. natural gas exports to Europe.##544|It looks like you have reached this page in error ...

Most Popular Destinations##545|The Obama administration made its sixth update of the year on Obamacare enrollment Monday — without ever revealing how many customers have paid.

A blog post from Marilyn Tavenner, director of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, boasts 5 million sign-ups so far. The administration has updated the enrollment tally twice a month since millions of customers were required to pay their premiums, but officials have declined yet again to disclose payment information.

Monday’s unscheduled update revealed that the administration can now count 5 million selected plans on Obamacare exchanges across the country — 1 million in California alone. It’s a desperately needed coup for the administration, which is two weeks away from the final enrollment deadline.

But like Tavenner’s other surprise enrollment updates, the blog post is devoid of details or statistics. Instead, it’s chock full of stories about those who were so happy to receive Obamacare that they cried.

Official monthly enrollment announcements merit a conference call with media and a formal state breakdown from the Department of Health and Human Services. But detailed demographic information wasn’t released until mid-January — over halfway through the open enrollment period.

The late release emphasized the administration’s failure to enroll nearly enough of its key demographic, healthy people aged 18 to 35. Through February’s end, Obamacare exchange customers were only 25 percent “young invincibles” — leaving very little time to meet the administration’s prior minimum target of 39 percent.

As of January, customers that paid have been using their Obamacare insurance. But the Obama administration continues to say it doesn’t know how many have paid their premiums.

The best estimates come from consulting firms’ studies of data from insurance companies. Goldman Sachs’ latest indicates that 80 percent of the number the White House has advertised will follow through and purchase their coverage; McKinsey estimates only 77 percent. Such a record would bring that 5 million down to 3.85-4 million instead.

Tripoli/Al Sidra, Libya: Libya’s parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after a tanker loaded with oil from a rebel-held port escaped the navy, officials said.

Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdullah Al Thani, parliament spokesman Omar Hmeidan told reporters.

The news deepens the turmoil in the North African country, a member of the Opec oil producer group, where the government has struggled to impose order and rein in militias that helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority.

Deputies said they had mounted a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to load crude at Al Sidra port and escaped the navy, which earlier claimed it had seized the ship.

Zeidan had told Reuters late on Monday in an interview the navy and allied militias had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.

He had for months been facing rising opposition from Islamists and the wider public, which blamed him for Libya’s bumpy transition since the 2011 Nato-backed uprising.

The spectacular tanker escape was the tipping point.

“The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,” said Al Sharif Al Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said.

On Saturday, Zeidan had said the navy would bomb the tanker if it tried to leave the port, one of three occupied by eastern rebels demanding a greater share of oil wealth and power.

But the ship had moved into international waters early on Tuesday morning after a brief firefight with government forces, port workers allied to the rebels and an oil official said.

“We escorted the tanker out of the port at 3am,” said a rebel fighter at the harbour. “We came under fire from light arms [from the navy] but there were no casualties.”

CLASHES REPORTED

In another worrying sign for the Tripoli government, rebel gunmen blocked the gate to an airbase in Sirte, a city located close to Al Sidra.

Residents reported clashes in the afternoon between pro-government forces and rebels in the coastal city.

In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.

Western powers worry the conflict might break up the vast country dominated by competing tribes and militias, all heavily armed.

The port rebels also demand autonomy for the east, which had been neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.

The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.

Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi’s ousting, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled the dictator.##547|Empty##548|Urban Outfitters, Inc., a lifestyle products and services company, engages in the retail and wholesale of general consumer products.

But on Tuesday, as Ackman was jumping on a conference call to slam the practices of Herbalife, a company he has been lobbying against in Washington, the shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plunged.

Shares of Fannie Mae fell by 32% and shares of Freddie Mac fell by more than 28% on Tuesday after U.S. senators in Washington announced a bipartisan agreement that could lead to the shutdown of the mortgage giants, which have been operating under government conservatorship. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson and Senator Mike Crapo are behind the plan announced Tuesday that calls for a new government insurer to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The new measure in Washington, which was put together with help from the White House, has at the very least stalled the recent boom in the stocks of Fannie and Freddie. Shares of the GSEs have soared this year on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board, putting a positive charge in the returns of hedge funds like Pershing Square. Still, shares of Fannie Mae are up a huge 32% this year. They are up by more than a 1,000% since the Fannie and Freddie penny stock boom started about a year ago.

The Obama Administration has long planned to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but now that the U.S. government has received more back from the GSEs than the $188 billion the government used to bail them out, there has been added momentum to the investor campaign in Washington and the courts that could bring enormous value to the shares of Fannie and Freddie.

Ackman’s big position is in the common shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Other prominent money managers like Richard Perry and Bruce Berkowitz are betting more on the preferred securities of the mortgage giants. Trading in all these shares has been very volatile in the last year as investors react to bumps in both Washington and the courts. The ups and downs in the preferred shares, however, which receive preferred treatment to the common share, have been a little less extreme. Shares of the popularly traded preferred series S fell by 3% on Tuesday.##550|Why did this happen?

The calmly spoken words – "All right, good night" – were broadcast from the jet after someone on board first disabled one of its communication systems – the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) – about 40 minutes after takeoff. Investigators believe it was co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid who spoke the words. The ACARS equipment sends information about the jet's engines and other data to the airline and the revelation that there was no mention of trouble on board has added to suspicions that one or both of the pilots were somehow involved in the disappearance of the flight. With the transponder going down about 14 minutes later, investigators are now convinced that the plane's disappearance was deliberate. Whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, according to Malaysian officials and aviation experts.

“We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott The new theory comes as police searched the homes of both pilots over the weekend. They confiscated an elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues. Shah, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories. The head of Malaysia Airlines said the simulator was not in itself cause for any suspicion. The dad-of-three was also said to be a 'fanatical' supporter of Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was jailed for homosexuality just hours before the plane vanished. His wife and three children moved out of their home the day before.

Malaysian police are also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off. Sources have also claimed that the jet could have been deliberately flown to a Taliban base on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The search for the plane, which went missing over a week ago with 239 people on board, has now widened as the Malaysian government believe the plane was deliberately diverted and may have flown as far north as Central Asia or south into the Indian Ocean. Australia has now taken the lead in searching for the missing Boeing 777 over the southern Indian Ocean as they through a huge area of Asia, stretching into Kazakhstan.##556|WASHINGTON - US Navy Seals have boarded and taken control of a North Korea-flagged tanker that had loaded crude oil at a port held by rebels in eastern Libya, the Pentagon said Monday.

Today’s reading was below the Investing.com forecast of 82.0. The index is off its 85.1 interim high set in July of last year.

See the chart below for a long-term perspective on this widely watched indicator. I’ve highlighted recessions and included real GDP to help evaluate the correlation between the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and the broader economy.

Click for a larger image

To put today’s report into the larger historical context since its beginning in 1978, consumer sentiment is now 6 percent below the average reading (arithmetic mean) and 5 percent below the geometric mean. The current index level is at the 34th percentile of the 435 monthly data points in this series.

The Michigan average since its inception is 85.1. During non-recessionary years the average is 87.5. The average during the five recessions is 69.3. So the latest sentiment number puts us 10.6 points above the average recession mindset and 7.6 points below the non-recession average.

It’s important to understand that this indicator is somewhat volatile with a 3.1 point absolute average monthly change. For a visual sense of the volatility here is a chart with the monthly data and a three-month moving average.

For the sake of comparison here is a chart of the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index (monthly update here). The Conference Board Index is the more volatile of the two, but the broad pattern and general trends have been remarkably similar to the Michigan Index.

The trend in sentiment since the Financial Crisis lows has been one of slow improvement, but it has been more or less range bound since 2012, hovering between 72 and 85.

When the annual open enrollment period ends on March 31, most people will be unable to purchase individual health coverage from any source until the next open enrollment period this fall.

Iowa State University Extension Family Finance Specialist Suzanne Bartholomae says that it has been widely publicized that the open enrollment period for the new Health Insurance Marketplace at www.healthcare.gov ends on March 31, but most people are unaware that the term “open enrollment period” applies not only to the official Health Insurance Marketplace, but also to all individual health insurance policies. She says that means that outside of the designated open enrollment period, most people who want to purchase health insurance on the individual market will be unable to purchase health insurance anywhere.

We talked to Extension Specialist Jan Monahan, who tells us about the fines that will go into effect if you don’t have health insurance by the deadline.

The 2014 open enrollment period was set for a full six months to provide time for people to learn about the new health insurance system. In the future, however, the annual open enrollment period will be shorter, about two months starting in autumn each year.

Group plans will continue to be open to new group members; for example, newly-hired employees will be able to enroll in the employer’s health insurance plan regardless of what time of the year they are hired or during their employer’s annual open enrollment. But those who purchase insurance in the individual market must do so this month or be prepared to wait until the fall 2014 open enrollment period.

The man who cobbled the deal together said yesterday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a "well-known billionaire."

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation sent by the firm in 2010.

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

"He wants his next of kin to keep working hard," Frances said.

Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death.

Frances also said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.##566|Empty##567|US investors closely monitoring Pimco after CEO's resignation

Several US institutional investors said they are closely monitoring the developments at Pimco, the world's largest bond firm, in the wake of Mohamed El-Erian's abrupt resignation as CEO and ensuing acrimony between him and co-founder Bill Gross, Reuters reported Tuesday.



The investors, including retirement systems, have formally put Pimco on "watch lists," a signal that they will keep a much closer eye on its performance than usual. It could eventually lead to reductions in the amount of money they allocate to funds at the firm, whose full name is Pacific Investment Management Co and which has $1.91 trillion in assets.



"We intend to go out and meet with them over the course of the next month," said David Hunter, chief investment officer of the North Dakota State Investment Board.



The board, which has about $400 million invested with Pimco, put the fund on its watch list on February 28.



Hunter said the board could ultimately decide not to make any changes to its allocation.



The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest US pension fund, said it had not placed Pimco on a formal watch list, but it was also paying close attention to developments.



In a statement, Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge said, "we are focused on communication with our clients, and have been in regular contact with them following the recent leadership transition. They understand the changes we have taken and why, and are ready to move forward with us."



The closer scrutiny by state and local pension systems shows that Gross, though, may have more work to do to assuage investor concerns after El-Erian's surprise departure and reports of growing discord between the two men amid weak fund performance.



Overall, customers withdrew $41.1 billion from Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund last year, a record amount for the manager, according to investment research firm Morningstar. The fund posted another $1.6 billion in outflows in February, reducing assets to $236 billion and marking the 10th straight month of outflows.



The Total Return Fund, which Gross manages, trailed more than 70 percent of its peers in February.



Last month, a Wall Street Journal article described the worsening relationship between the two men as Pimco's performance deteriorated. Later, Gross said that El-Erian, who is due to leave the firm in less than a week, was trying to "undermine" him by talking to the Journal.



A memo from investment consultant NEPC to the City of Fresno Retirement System Joint Boards noted "an elevated level of concern" around the changes at Pimco.

##568|BEIJING, China—China has announced plans to expand its cities and improve public services to support economic growth by allowing millions more rural residents to migrate to urban jobs.

The Cabinet plan issued Sunday calls for raising the share of China’s population of almost 1.4 billion people living in cities to 60 percent from 53.7 percent now, a shift of about 90 million people.

ADVERTISEMENT

The ruling Communist Party sees allowing people to migrate into cities for higher-paid jobs as a pillar of more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

China’s evolution from a mostly rural society began with market-oriented economic reform in the 1980s. Cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have grown to become among the world’s largest but migrants are hampered by a household registration system that binds them to their hometowns. That limits access to schools, health care and pensions even for those who live in cities for years.

Sunday’s announcement of the “National New Type Urbanization Plan” for 2014-2020 gave no financial or other details. But plans announced earlier call for improving housing for 100 million people who live in dilapidated shantytowns.

“Domestic demand is the fundamental impetus for China’s development, and the greatest potential for expanding domestic demand lies in urbanization,” the report said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

The ruling party has promised in its latest five-year development blueprint to make the economy more productive by giving entrepreneurs and market forces a bigger role and overhauling banking and other industries.

The urbanization plan says railways will reach cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020 and those with more than 500,000 people will be linked by high-speed rail, according to Xinhua.

It promises to pursue a “human-centered and environmentally friendly path,” according to Xinhua.

“A scientific and reasonable urban development model should be adopted, with green production and consumption becoming the mainstream in urban economic activities,” it said. “China should strive to push for harmonious and pleasant living conditions.”

Longer-term, authorities expect 300 million people from the countryside to become city dwellers by 2030, the equivalent of migration by the entire United States population.

The latest plan promises to give permanent urban status to 100 million rural migrants, according to Xinhua.

A study by Tsinghua University in Beijing found only 27.6 percent of China’s people have urban status with full claims to education, health and other public services, while hundreds of millions of city dwellers with rural status have limited benefits.

Regulators have imposed governance ‘enhancements’ on Tesla that would benefit Facebook shareholders too, writes Jennifer Wells.##570|The U.S. Attorney's office in New York has opened a criminal investigation into General Motors to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing on the part of GM stemming from the automaker's faulty ignition switch recall last month, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.

The FBI has joined federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York in the probe, reports CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton. Subpoenas have already begun to go out.

General Motors announced Wednesday that it is offering free loaner cars and $500 toward a new GM vehicle to more than a million owners of the compact cars that are being recalled.

For several weeks, CBS News has been reporting on its investigation into the GM recall. At least 13 people have died in accidents linked to the ignition-switch defect. CBS News' reporting showed GM was aware of the problem years before the recall. On Tuesday, a congressional committee opened an investigation.

Last month, GM began a recall of 1.6 million cars including Chevrolet Cobalts made from 2005 to 2007, Pontiac G5s, Saturn Ions and Pontiac Soltices, among others.

CBS News correspondent Jeff Glor reported that another death that may be linked.

When a Chevy Cobalt crashed in Georgia four years ago this week, the engine was not running. The ignition switch was in the accessory position. A 29-year-old nurse named Brooke Melton, who was wearing her seat belt, died.

"When I saw my daughter in the emergency room and I kissed her cold forehead, I said, I will vindicate this. I will vindicate your death. And I will try to save as many lives as I can," said her father, Ken Melton.

Five years before Brooke Melton died, General Motors issued a service bulletin to its dealers about faulty ignition switches.

When Brooke Melton took her car to a GM dealership, the service report, which CBS News obtained, said "Customer states engine shut off while driving, please check."

Technicians cleaned the fuel injection.

Melton got the car back on March 9. She was killed March 10.

GM settled with the family last year.

Lance Cooper, who represents the Meltons, says he believes the recall would not have happened if the family had not sued.

GM now says ignition switches can turn to off or accessory when they're bumped, or if a driver has a heavy key ring. When that happens, a car has no power steering, no power brakes, and the seat belts and airbags don't work.

Cooper discovered that GM changed the switch design in 2006 but never notified customers or dealers. When the settlement offer came, he was about to depose Jim Federico, the man who ran GM's investigation into the issue in 2012 and 2013. Federico is now the company's executive director of engineering.##571|Empty##572|##573|Los Angeles Sues Time Warner For $10M In Unpaid Fees

TORONTO -- Longer-term fixed mortgage rates may soon be a better deal than variable rates for homebuyers, according to a new report by BMO Capital Markets.

BMO (TSX:BMO) chief economist Douglas Porter and senior economist Benjamin Reitzes say that historically, choosing a variable mortgage rate has been more "cost-effective" than locking in on a five-year fixed rate, but this may no longer be the case as signs of an improving economy continue.

It's been long anticipated that both the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to hike interest rates in 2015.

"True, it may have seemed that markets and economists have played the role of The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf on higher interest rates in recent years," says the report released Thursday, titled "Mortgage Choices: The Fix(ed) is In."

"But there are emerging signs that the tide is finally turning for rates, especially with the U.S. economy poised to accelerate. The bond market has sent out loud warning signals over the past year that the era of low interest rates may finally be drawing to a close."

Currently, a five-year fixed mortgage rate from one of the big Canadian banks hovers above three per cent, with variable rates ranging below that.

Porter and Reitzes say that as bond yields rise they will put pressure on borrowing costs and long-term mortgages.

"So, even if variable rates take some time to climb, we may not see such low fixed rates again any time soon," says the report.

They also said any potential hikes will affect most those who are already stretched too thinly in the housing market, so locking in at a higher rate may be beneficial for this group to weather any drastic increases.

"For those who don't have much financial flexibility and would run into difficulty from a pronounced upswing in interest rates (typically first-time homebuyers), any potential extra cost for peace of mind now appears to be a price well worth paying," according to the report.

Earlier this week, the Teranet-National Bank national composite price index found that home prices are steadily rising.

In February, Canada home prices rose 0.3 per cent.

The index, which tracks the average home price in 11 metropolitan markets, found that home prices were up in all five markets surveyed in Western Canada and were down in all five metropolitan eastern markets except Montreal.##576|'Candy Crush Saga' company forecasts $613 million IPO

MOBILE GAMES

'Candy Crush' firm set for IPO

The company behind the addictive blockbuster game "Candy Crush Saga" believes it could raise nearly $613 million in an initial public offering.

In a regulatory filing Wednesday, King Digital Entertainment, which has offices in San Francisco, said it plans to sell 15.3 million shares in the offering. Existing shareholders will sell an additional 6.7 million shares.

"Candy Crush" was the most downloaded free app on iPhones and iPads in 2013, beating Facebook, Google Maps and YouTube.

The shares are expected to be priced between $21 and $24, for a total of between $466.2 million and $532.8 million. Underwriters have the option of buying up to an additional 3.3 million shares. That could raise an additional $69.9 million to $79.9 million.

NUTRITION

FTC probing Herbalife

Herbalife Ltd., the nutrition company that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has accused of being a pyramid scheme, disclosed that the Federal Trade Commission has started a civil probe into its practices.

Herbalife shares dropped more than 7 percent to close at $60.57 Wednesday after rising as much as 6.2 percent before the inquiry was disclosed. Through Tuesday, the shares had gained 54 percent since Ackman announced his short position.

Herbalife is confident it is in compliance with all laws and will cooperate with the investigation, the Cayman Islands company said.

The probe marks an achievement for Ackman, who in 2012 made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife's shares and started working to persuade regulators to shut the company down, saying it misleads distributors, misrepresents sales figures and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. The company has repeatedly denied Ackman's allegations and won allies including billionaire Carl Icahn.

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace," the company said.

Justin Cole, a spokesman for the FTC, declined to comment.

COMPENSATION

Bonuses up 15% on Wall Street

Wall Street's bonus pool rose 15 percent to $26.7 billion in 2013, fueled by compensation deferred from prior years, according to estimates by New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.

Employees took home an average bonus of $164,530 last year, the most since the 2008 financial crisis and the third highest on record, DiNapoli said in a statement Wednesday. The bonuses rose even as profits from broker-dealer operations of New York Stock Exchange member firms fell 30 percent to $16.7 billion in 2013.

Shares of Goldman Sachs Group, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each rose more than 95 percent over the past two years, making equity awards worth more than when they were granted in previous years. During the same period, the bonus pool has grown by 44 percent, driven by deferred compensation, DiNapoli said.

"The industry still had a good year in 2013 despite costly legal settlements and higher interest rates," said DiNapoli. "Wall Street continues to demonstrate resilience as it evolves in a changing regulatory environment."

AVIATION

Airline earnings drop further

Airline earnings for 2014 will be $1 billion or 5 percent lower than previously predicted as political tensions drive up oil prices and growth in emerging markets slows, the International Air Transport Association said.

Carriers will earn a combined net income of $18.7 billion, compared with the $19.7 billion forecast on Dec. 12, the industry group said Wednesday. Revenues will reach about $745 billion, about $2 billion higher than previously projected.

"This can be characterized as a tweak," said association Chief Executive Officer Tony Tyler. "The overall story is positive. Staying in the black is a major achievement reflecting the restructuring that has taken place."

The cost of crude will rise to an average $108 a barrel, higher than expected, adding about $3 million to the industry's fuel bill, the group said Wednesday. Kerosene accounts for about 30 percent of airline expenses, though an economic upturn is spurring demand to a level that largely compensates for the impact on oil prices of geopolitical instability, it said.

ENERGY

Oil prices fall on China worry

The price of oil dropped below $98 a barrel Wednesday as the possibility of a deeper economic slowdown in China fed expectations of weaker demand and a report showed a rise in U.S. oil supplies.

Benchmark U.S. crude for April delivery fell $2.04, or 2 percent, to close at $97.99 a barrel, the first close below $100 in a month.

Brent crude, used to set prices for international varieties of crude, dropped 53 cents to $108.02 on the London futures exchange.

China's drop in exports in February fueled worries of a further slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, which would tamp down demand for energy. China's economic growth of 7.7 percent last year was the lowest in two decades.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Department said U.S. crude oil supplies grew by 6.2 million barrels last week, well above the increase of 2.3 million barrels expected by analysts surveyed by Platts, the energy information arm of McGraw-Hill Cos.##577|MILAN, March 8 (Reuters) - The crisis in Ukraine does not yet pose a threat to gas supplies but it is a wake up call for Europe to rethink its energy strategy, the head of Italian oil and gas group Eni said on Saturday.

In an interview with Italian daily La Stampa, Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said the standoff between Ukraine and Russia would not have an impact on gas supplies thanks partly to mild weather across Europe.

“But certainly if the tension continues I do have a few worries for next year,” he said.

On Friday, Russian gas giant Gazprom warned it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on Ukraine’s supporters in Europe, which gets half its Russian gas through the country.

“In any case, precisely in light of this crisis, Europe needs to rethink its energy strategy,” he said.

Gazprom halted gas supplies to Ukraine over unpaid bills at the beginning of 2009 prompting cuts to supplies of Russian gas to Europe during a cold winter.

Scaroni said that Italy’s gas supply structure meant it was in a position to overcome any crisis involving a single supplier, albeit at an extra cost.

“But if another one (supplier) went down the problems would be serious,” he said.

Italy, which imports around 90 percent of its gas needs, has long-term supply agreements in place with Russia, Algeria, Libya and the Netherlands.

In 2012 Russia accounted for around a third of overall imports but data from gas transport grid operator Snam on Friday showed Russian volumes were more than half of daily flows.

Violence in Libya has reduced supplies into Italy and last year Eni agreed to take less gas from Algeria as part of a renegotiation of its long-term gas contracts with the country.

Eni, Italy’s biggest listed company, is one of Europe’s biggest gas wholesalers.

Scaroni said it was improbable Russia would suspend its gas supplies through Ukraine unless there was the threat of actual war between the two countries, which he believed unlikely.

“The Ukrainians make $3 billion a year for the transit of Russian gas through their country. For them that’s a large amount,” he said.

Scaroni, who will be meeting with Gazprom’s head on Tuesday, said it was crucial for Russia to be reliable as a supplier to its Western clients.##578|Empty##579|Four central European countries are asking the United States to make it easier for them to import natural gas from the U.S. so they can reduce their reliance on Russia.

Ambassadors from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia made their appeal in a letter to the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner.

They wrote that U.S. natural gas would be welcome in central and eastern Europe and would be a key U.S. interest in the region.

Previous disputes over gas payments between Russia and Ukraine have caused Russia to cut off supplies. The same pipelines that bring Russian gas to Ukraine also supply eastern Europe, creating shortages there.

Russia Friday warned the interim Ukrainian government of another possible shutdown over unpaid gas bills.

Boehner said Saturday he hopes President Barack Obama will direct the secretary of energy to immediately approve pending na tural gas export requests so America's friends in Europe and around the world can reduce their dependency on Russia.

The White House has said that a mild European winter has created above average gas supplies and that any new exports would be unlikely to reach Europe before the end of 2015.

The lawsuit against the ESM was the largest constitutional complaint in German history: In June 2012, several professors and legislators, joined by more than 37,000 private citizens, filed suit against the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) before Germany's Federal Constitutional Court.

"The federal government and the parliament are responsible for Germany's finances. And the Federal Constitutional Court has already ruled in previous cases that [German law] prohibits the automatic financial burden-sharing of other countries' debts in the European Union," said Joachim Starbatty, a retired economics professor at the University of Tübingen and one of the plaintiffs. The bailout scheme is an instrument that has simply prepared the way for a socialization of debt, he told DW in an interview.

Specifically, the plaintiffs fear that the ESM - with its current lending volume of 500 billion euros ($696.9 billion) - could be automatically extended in an emergency, undercutting the German parliament's constitutional right to approve or reject all budgetary decisions that affect Germany.

A 'yes, but…' ruling

Germany's highest court ruled differently, arguing that the German parliament remained the relevant authority because of an ESM law which was passed parallel to the ESM treaty. The constitutional justices handed down one of their typical 'yes, but' verdicts on matters of European integration: Yes, the ESM was constitutional, but only under the condition that Germany's liability be limited to 190 billion euros ($264.8 billion) and that any further liabilites had to be approved by parliament.

Jürgen Matthes: Surprised by the opinion of the Constitutional Court

So far, so good, except that just a week before the ruling in that fateful September 2012, the European Central Bank introduced its so-called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program. With this program, the ECB gave itself permission, in an emergency, to buy unlimited amounts of bonds from crisis-hit EU member states. This program dwarfed all previous 'big gun' financial instruments at its disposal and promptly reassured financial markets.

But what had served to keep the euro crisis in check ended up sparking a storm of indignation in Germany. The ECB was financing national budgets and wildly overstepping its mandate, the critics said. Here, too, the German Supreme Court reserved the right to pass judgment on the OMT program.

A 'no, except…' opinion

Then, in February, came the surprising announcement from the High Court to first refer the case to the European level. It asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to check whether the bond purchase program constituted a breach of EU treaties. The fact that, in the eyes of the Constitutional Court, the ECB had exceeded its mandate was made clear in the court's written opinion.

"I think we were very surprised by the opinion of the Constitutional Court because it very clearly placed itself on the side of the plaintiff," said Jürgen Matthes of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW). The judges had broken their familiar "yes, but…" pattern, instead going with "no, except…" "The statement made it clear that if the program is not changed, then it can't be considered to be a true mandate for the ECB," Matthes told DW.

The program could be amended to ensure that it was limited in both its timeframe and scope of bond purchases. But doing so would take away its firepower, which we have to thank for the current calm in the eurozone, he said.

Monetary policy or fiscal policy?

But that calm is deceptive, say critics of the ECB, because the root causes of the crisis have not been eliminated. The economic imbalances in the eurozone continue, even if the differences in interest rates on government bonds, also called interest rate spreads, are artificially reduced by the ECB. These differences are reflected in the different risks.

Starbatty is one of the main plaintiffs in the suit against the ESM bailout fund

"And, importantly, the German Constitutional Court has said that if the ECB gets into interest rate spreads, then it is no longer engaging in monetary policy but fiscal policy because it wants to reduce interest rates for distressed debtor states," said Starbatty. He is pleased that the high court justices have accepted this position of the plaintiffs.

IW's Matthes, however, believes the Court has leaned too far out the window. "It has moved onto economic terrain, ignoring the fact that financial markets are quite capable of irrationally overreacting" thereby driving previously solvent states into bankruptcy.

But this is exactly what the role of the ESM should be, argues Matthes: to come to the rescue of solvent states in such a situation. Is the ESM not just duplicating the ECB's OMT program? Is the difference not just in the fact that the ESM is subject to democratic legitimation and therefore could not act fast enough in an emergency?

Matthes says 'no'. The objective of the two instruments is different, even if both reach into the realm of government bonds and produce a similar effect. For the ECB, its monetary policy is meant to provide financial aid to crisis countries, while the ESM operates in the realm of fiscal policy by intervening directly on the government bond market.

Splitting the proceedings

If this all sounds a bit too complicated, it should come as no surprise that the Constitutional Court has decided to separate the issues of the OMT and the ESM in the main proceedings. In the judgment on the bailout expected on Tuesday (18.03.2014), it will only be a question of whether the budget law supremacy of the German parliament is being undermined.

"This has already been dealt with in the preliminary verdict. And, as the court has already said that it is acceptable as long as any increase in liability is approved by parliament, I'm not expecting any new findings," said Starbatty.

The suspense will continue, then, until the European Court of Justice has expressed its opinion on the OMT program and, in turn, Germany's Constitutional Court then makes its final judgment. Either the ECJ restricts the OMT program, thereby limiting its impact, or the ECJ sees the bond purchase program as fully justified. Should that happen, then the German Constitutional Court would have to make a 180-degree turn, although this is unlikely.

But, if that were to happen, warns Matthes, "then we [would be] in a situation in which we either change the constitution or possibly European treaties, or where, in the end, the Bundesbank is more or less forced out of the monetary union." That, he stressed, would ultimately mean a German withdrawal from the monetary union.##581|It's been five years since the stock market hit its low point of the financial crisis and Great Recession.

Online travel companies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE) are two of the biggest winners of the bull market. Priceline shares have surged 1,646% and Expedia has soared 1,182% during the past five years.

Fast-growing consumer stocks have also done well, including Chipotle (CMG), Whole Foods (WFM) and Starbucks (SBUX). Wynn Resorts (WYNN), the casino company, and Netflix (NFLX) were big winners as well. Those stocks also gained at least 1,000%.

Big tech companies Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) had slightly less spectacular gains. They're in a group of stocks that have gained between 500% and 1,000% since March 2009. Ford (F) and Delta Airlines (DAL), two companies that were hit hard during the recession, are also among the companies that have far outpaced the S&P 500's gain of nearly 180%.

But there were a few stocks that have been left behind.

Avon Products (AVP), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) were big laggards. Best Buy (BBY), which was one of the best performers in 2013, is still up only 4% in the past five years.

And a few stocks actually missed the rally entirely. Shares of Staples (SPLS), which recently announced plans to close hundreds of stores, have fallen. First Solar (FSLR) shares are down 47% over the past five years, giving it the dubious distinction as the bull market's biggest loser.##582|Jennifer Wells: Elon Musk has been reined in.

Shares of Urban Outfitters (URBN) finished down more than 4% after the company reported mixed results for the fourth quarter and a warning for the current quarter. Earnings per share beat estimates by $0.04, but revenue missed. The company said it is "cautious" about its current quarter due to disappointing sales at its Urban Outfitters stores. Its Anthropologie and Free People brands have performed much better, seeing double digit sales increases in the fourth quarter while the Urban Outfitters chains saw sales decline##584|HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is planning a U.S. IPO in the third quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, in what is the expected to be a more than $15 billion deal.

The Hangzhou, China-based company, which controls about 80 percent of the country's e-commerce, had been in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission since last year about a potential listing, but the island city's regulators blocked its proposal as it violated the "one-share-one-vote principle".

After an initial rebuff, Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators were back at the negotiating table late last year, to find a solution to the vexed problem. While the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd has initiated a review of its listing rules to accommodate more flexible structures, any change to the existing rules would take months.

Alibaba does not want to miss the technology boom, which has boosted valuations of Internet companies both in the United States and in Hong Kong. Alibaba's planned IPO would be the highest-profile Internet listing since Facebook Inc's $16 billion deal in 2012.

It was not entirely clear if talks between Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators have completely ceased, but the chances of a Hong Kong listing looks increasingly unlikely, the people added.

The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.

Alibaba could file listing documents with the U.S. regulators as soon as April, one of the people said. The deal is crucial for investment banks as it is estimated it will generate $260 million in underwriting fees, Reuters previously reported.

"There is no timeline, no venue selected nor have any underwriters been hired for an IPO event," an Alibaba spokeswoman said.

'NO CHANGE TO STRUCTURE'

The listing also is closely watched by Alibaba's two largest shareholders - Yahoo Inc which owns 24 percent and Japan's Softbank Corp which controls 37 percent. Alibaba's founders and some senior managers jointly own about 13 percent of the company, which analysts estimate is worth at least $140 billion.

Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are among the two banks poised to win top underwriting mandates, while other banks are also expected to join the syndicate, the people familiar with the matter added.

Alibaba's corporate structure allows a group of top partners to nominate and control the board, which is at odds with Hong Kong's stock exchange's listing rules.

Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman told Reuters in an interview this week the company would not change its partnership structure in order to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

"The one thing I can't understand is people think we're going to change our partnership structure just to accommodate a listing in Hong Kong, that's never going to happen," said Tsai.

Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley did not reply to emails seeking comment.

Beginning Monday, the currency trading band is being doubled, from 1% to 2% on either side of the central bank’s daily reference rate.

This is the fourth time in about seven years that the bank has loosened its hold on the renminbi, popularly known as the yuan, and the change is the largest ever. The last time the People’s Bank widened the trading band on the renminbi was in April 2012, when the band was widened from 0.5% to 1%. Prior to that, the band was last widened from 0.3% to 0.5% in May 2007.

Moves such as this matter. The bank has long said that it wants the renminbi to become an international currency, but it has been unwilling to let the currency trade freely. During the financial crisis, many economists and politicians called for China to loosen its control on the renminbi and allow it to strengthen. That would have had the effect of raising the prices for the country’s exports, giving the manufacturing industries in other countries — like the United States — a price advantage the market.

Further widening of the renminbi’s trading band is unlikely to have much effect on currency exchange rates. A currency price change of more than 2% a day is a rare thing. What the bank’s next move will be is anybody’s guess, and ours is that it will remove entirely its daily fixed reference rate and allow the country’s currency to float freely. That is not likely to happen for a few years, though, as the country assesses the impact of this latest change.

The widening of the trading band should also signal to the country’s investors that the government is going to take its thumb off the scales and allow the free market to play a larger role in setting prices. Removing currency controls entirely would take away the advantages that state-owned enterprises, big exporters and the government itself have in the Chinese economy.

The yuan gained 2.9% in 2013 and closed at 6.1502 to the dollar on Friday. Since the beginning of the year, the currency has slipped nearly 2%. Its largest single swing was a drop of 0.86% on February 28, the biggest one-day decline since 2007.

China’s GDP growth last year totaled 7.7%, and the country is aiming for GDP growth of 7.5% this year. But if the yuan continues to appreciate, hitting that target gets harder. In a note, JPMorgan economists led by Zhu Haibin wrote that yuan depreciation, “could support exports, and capital outflow will drain domestic liquidity and open the window for reserve-requirement ratio cuts by the PBOC.” Bloomberg News reported that Zhu also cut his 2014 growth estimate for Chinese GDP from 7.4% to 7.2%.##586|Janet Yellen had an interesting request when in February she became the first woman to head the Federal Reserve: She instructed her staff that she was officially to be known as "chair," rather than chairman or chairwoman, of the central bank. Just chair.



This is consistent with her low-key professional advance to what some might consider the pinnacle of financial power. Although Yellen has done barrier-breaking work examining the pay gap between men and women, her way has always been to ignore gender issues or to address them obliquely. Instead, she seems to have preferred letting her achievements speak for themselves, while presumably counting on others to notice.



Still, while it's tempting to conclude from her success that this is all any woman needs to prosper, it's worth paying attention to some other key attributes that supported Yellen's rise.

First, she had a strongly supportive spouse -- (Nobel Laureate) economist George Akerlof -- who worked in her field and understood how it worked. She moved for his job over their respective careers, but he also moved for hers. No one took a back seat. Smart women have no hope of being treated as an equal at work if they aren't treated that way at home. The supportive spouse is not just a logistical, but rather a psychological necessity.

Second, Yellen had a number of strong female allies. At Harvard University, where she once taught, Yellen collaborated with another rare female economist, Rachel McCulloch. They didn't spend their time lamenting the absence of women in their department, or the unlikelihood of tenure. Instead, the pair produced five papers together. Later on, Laura Tyson, who headed President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, recommended Yellen for the Fed.



Moreover, it's arguable that Yellen would never have gotten a chance to lead the Fed had it not been for the active and vocal support of other women who were prepared to argue publicly that President Obama's first choice -- Lawrence Summers -- would not be acceptable.



In other words, it's seductive for women to imagine that just working hard is enough to make it to the top. This is what one senior lawyer recently described to me as the "Cinderella myth." The more pragmatic truth is that men and women alike need strong allies and collaborators -- people who notice them and want to encourage and are willing to fight for them when doing so for themselves would be counterproductive.

When Yellen insists on the title of chair, she reminds us that leadership roles should have no gender attached to them -- not male, not female. Having experienced no small degree of sexism in her own career path, she appears to have no appetite for perpetuating it.



In this, she's entirely consistent with most of the female leaders I've known, studied and profiled. When women run their own businesses, they typically create companies in which men and women alike can thrive. It's just another reason why we should celebrate the accession of women to power -- because everyone wins.##587|Satellite images on a Chinese government website show suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating off the southern tip of Vietnam, near the plane's original flight path, China's Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.



The revelation could provide searchers with a focus that has eluded them since the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard early Saturday.



No other governments have confirmed the Xinhua report, which did not say when Chinese officials became aware of the images and associated them with the missing plane.



The new Chinese reports of the satellite images came after several days of sometimes confusing and conflicting statements from Malaysian officials.



The Malaysian government said it had asked India to join in the search near the Andaman Sea, suggesting the jetliner might have reached those waters after crossing into the Strait of Malacca, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the flight's last-known coordinates.



Aviation officials in Vietnam said they never heard from the plane.



The alert says one airline found a 16-inch crack in one plane, then checked other 777s and found more cracking.

US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of State John Kerry have each responded firmly to these events. Kerry issued a warning to Russian President Putinof the isolation his country would soon face “politically, economically, and diplomatically.” Obama has spoken with Putin directly in attempt to diplomatically influence a reversal of Russia’s intrusion. Unfortunately, Putin has not yet reversed course.

Even if Russia withdraws from Crimea and things in the region do calm, diplomatic levers to influence Russian behavior in the region will continue to be explored. Indeed, given the relative inability to affect the current situation, a long run set of strategies ought to be fully engaged. A fundamental lesson of the Cold War is that détente is born of a credible threat. Therefore, if US foreign policy is to be successful in swaying Russian behavior – current and future – then such a lever must be presented. Otherwise, Putin is correct in his assertion that “all threats against Russia are counterproductive and harmful.” The United States has a very clear opportunity to present a credible threat to Russia’s long term dominance in Europe. Ironically, it involves the very commodity that Russia has used to its advantage in recent history: natural gas.

Natural gas is the patrimony of the Russian economy and a major source of its political, economic, and diplomatic leverage over the Ukraine, the European Union, and its other former Soviet neighbors. Indeed, threats to Gazprom’s market share in Europe are taken very, very seriously. This has been demonstrated in recent years by a concerted effort by Gazprom to defend its market, as seen in physical infrastructure investments (i.e. – the North Stream pipeline), plans to develop other infrastructure (i.e. – the South Stream pipeline), and a willingness to alter pricing terms over the past several years in the face of competitive threats. Each of these commercial actions has been undertaken to secure direct access to central and western European markets by avoiding transit country risk (in Belarus and Ukraine) and to maintain long term contractual relationships with customers in Europe.

Importantly, the US government cannot actually direct any LNG supply to Europe, as that is a commercial decision in the hands of LNG suppliers and consumers. However, the US government can exercise policy levers that could lower barriers to entry and more easily facilitate trade to Europe.More specifically, if the countries of the European Union (EU)were granted Free Trade Agreement (FTA) statusthen the pathway for investment in LNG export capacity with anability to deliver supplies within the EU would be less encumbered. In effect, a non-FTA license from DOE would no longer be required for investment to commence on various US LNG export facilities, particularly since there are multiple LNG import facilities in Europe already with an ability to expand import volumes. Thus, FTA status to EU nations would present a credible threat to Russia’s long term dominance of the European market.

While such a policy direction does not present a near term solution to the current situation, it does present Russia with a new set of circumstances it will have to deal with going forward. The credible threat of US entry into the European gas market can be viewed as a policy move in a dynamic game. Whether or not US-sourcedLNG actually ever flows to Europe is not the issue. Indeed, if Russia were to act to defend its market, as it has demonstrated it will likely take strides to do (see above), then it is likely that little to no US gas would actually end up in Europe. However, the reaction by the Russians prompted by the policy move in the US would facilitate surety of gas supply to Europe, likely at a lower price than would have otherwise been the case. In the end, this outcome benefits Europe. As far as Ukraine is concerned, ittoo would be provided with an alternative long term supply option – via backhaul from its western neighbors. Of course, any actual supply to Europe from the US would take a while to materialize as no capacity to execute this trade currently exists, but the idea here is to present a credible threat that alters long term behavior, strategic and commercial.

In point of fact, it is not very likely that US LNG exports would have a measurable impact on European independence from Russian gas, particularly in the near term. To begin, the profit on US trade to Asia far exceeds the profit on US trade to Europe. So, either the price in Europe would have to rise substantially or sales from US LNG suppliers to Europe would have to be subsidized in order for large volumes of trade to Europe to happen. The European market currently exceeds 50 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), so we would have to see well over 1 or 2 bcfd of LNG flowing from the US to Europe for the impact to be noticeable. Importantly, the resource base in the US can facilitate larger volumes, but this is not the issue; rather, it is that the current barriers to market entry create delays and inject uncertainty around making such investments. FTA status removes this impediment. But, given the slow pace of the federal approval process for LNG export permits to non-FTA countries, US LNG suppliers will have little to no capability to send supplies to Europe for the foreseeable future, thus lending credence to the remarks ofEnergy and Commerce Chairman Fred Uptonearlier this week that "the Department of Energy's approval process for LNG exports is unnecessarily putting our allies at the mercy of Vladimir Putin.”

If the EU member states have FTA status, US exporters would have the ability to sell spot LNG cargoes in Europe without having to seek regulatory approval. Thus, such a commitment by the USgovernment signals a willingness to allow US suppliers to compete with Russia’s gas industry in Europe – a credible threat so dramatic that it could force a recalculation of all future Russian foreign policy moves vis-à-vis its western neighbors, even without ever sending any appreciable supplies of US-sourced LNG to Europe.

Post by Kenneth B Medlock III, Senior Director, Center for Energy Studies, Rice University’s Baker Institute, and Keily Miller, Research Associate, Center for Energy Studies, Rice University’s Baker Institute##590|An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy, worth $201m (£120m).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100m dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201m hit,” said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a “well-known billionaire”.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen’s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said. “It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard, who helped put together Geffen’s policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: “He wants his next of kin to keep working hard.”

He said the annual premium is in “the low single digits of millions of dollars”. He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon. Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire’s age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances’s firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.##591|Empty##592|Why did this happen?

They won the election and proceeded to make it worse, until now Obamacare is the central political issue of our time.

They promised that you could keep your doctor, that you could keep a plan you liked. They lied.

Health insurance is even less affordable than it was. Access to healthcare is more difficult, and the quality of healthcare is declining. Doctors and hospitals are finding that they cannot continue to operate under the restrictions of the new law.

The radical left has been engaged in a campaign of distraction over “income inequality,” their latest plan to transform America from a constitutional republic to a socialist oligarchy. Unfortunately for them, our health and how we obtain healthcare are issues that touch us all.

We all know people who have been harmed by the Obamacare law. They are not theories or hypothetical cases, but real, live people. Here are the stories of just a few.

The small business owner

Her employees were being shuffled onto an Obamacare plan where they would lose their vision and dental coverage. Deductibles would triple from $2100 per year to $6500. Copays would go from $50 to over $200. Premiums were to go up by 20 percent for this far worse coverage.

Then Obama announced you could go back to your old plan. How is this legal, even if the insurance company would take you back?

She called the insurance company back. They said that her company could get the old plan back — for the 20 percent increase — but the owner had to act by close of business the next day and get everyone and the company to fill out all new paperwork and reapply since it would be a “new” policy.

Her next hurdle is the rule which states that if the employer is not on the same plan, there may be a penalty of $50 per day per employee….or is it $100? The rules are still being written. The employer is currently on her spouse’s plan.

The retired veterinarian

After having the same medical insurance plan through the American Veterinary Medical Association for 31 years for himself and his disabled daughter, he received a cancellation letter in December 2012 stating that they could not find an underwriter due requirements in the Affordable Healthcare Act. His wife still has Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance through the local school district even though she is retired. They were able to get on her policy. The two plans are very similar as the school district has no mandate — for now.

Retired state civil servant

His state retirement fully covers medical for him and his family until he becomes 65; then Medicare becomes primary and his insurance secondary. In his state, there is a shortage of doctors and they can’t afford to see even long-time patients any more after they become Medicare eligible.

His wife is self-employed and he wonders how a person can be self-employed and pay income tax, 15.3 percent Social Security and Medicare taxes both as employer and employee, pay for medical coverage, and also contribute to some kind of retirement plan. He doesn’t see how small and sole-proprietor businesses make it — and many don’t.

Medical student

Another friend’s son turned 26 last year. He is in medical school. When he applied for health insurance he estimated he would make $16,000 a year. His premium is $40 a month. Preventative care is free. He got a good deal because of the Affordable Care Act, but it’s a subsidy. Universities used to provide affordable health insurance policies. Not now.

An employee

He is still working for one reason: health insurance. Going through the government is hell, prices are jacked to a level almost no one who works can afford. Even though the company he works for got an exemption this year, he may have to pay the full cost of his coverage next year. He hopes this nightmare ends soon.

Another worker

His family’s insurance premium has tripled with their new policy; the policy they wanted to keep was canceled. Their deductible is double what it was. Even worse, when his wife sees a doctor now, they say she has no insurance. “We are so sick of this.”

That’s just a cross-section of the many stories I have heard. We all have these stories and we must keep them in the forefront of our minds. We’re not the liars here: Harry Reid and Barack Obama are.

[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixNPplo-SU[/youtube]

This experiment in government control of healthcare is incompatible with American values and beliefs. It will fail, one way or the other. The politicians aren’t going to save either us or the system. The only way to fix the problems that they have made for us is for We the People to stand up as we did in 2009 and 2010 and finish the job.##597|Fruit giant Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal that will create the world’s largest banana supplier.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes, have its listing in New York and generate annual revenues of almost £3 billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn (£1.8bn) and some 20,000 staff.

The all-share tie-up will be subject to review by competition authorities but analysts believe it is unlikely to prompt major regulatory demands because the two businesses operate mainly inseparate North American and European markets.

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Colombia, Costa Rica and Guatemala.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including in Livingston, Portsmouth and Wakefield.

Chrysler Group Anti-Lock Brake Recall Affects 25,000+ SUVs

Last week, Chrysler Group issued a recall alert after a supplier brought a concern to the company concerning anti-lock braking. The Chrysler Group anti-lock brake recall affects 25,250 SUVs manufactured for 2012 and 2013 model years.

According to the official recall alert, Chrysler Group hopes to improve pedal feel during certain braking situations. While brake function is not lost and still complies with regulation, Chrysler Group believes that pedal feel is not consistent with customer expectation and seeks to resolve this. No injuries or accidents have been reported as a result of this issue.

Following an investigation, Chrysler Group learned that flow of brake-fluid was being limited to a high degree. A quick software update will optimize flow and bring the appropriate pedal feel to the SUVs.

Affected vehicles include Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos from 2012 and 2013. In total, these amount to 18,700 vehicles here in the States, as well as 530 in Mexico and 825 in Canada, plus an additional 5,200 in other markets.

Drivers of affected vehicles will be notified by Chrysler Group and instructed where to receive the update, at no cost to the customer. Concerned customers may also reach Chrysler Group by calling 1-800-853-1403.##604|Empty##605|Empty##606|Empty##607|Vodafone buys Spanish cable firm Ono for 7.2 bn euros

Ananthalakshmi SINGAPORE, March 12 (Reuters) - Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 5-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal. Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at $1,355 an ounce, traders said. Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing nearly 2 percent. "There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals. "It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said. "With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold's downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets." Spot gold had gained 0.7 percent to $1,358.10 an ounce by 0710 GMT, after earlier hitting $1,362.24 - its highest since Sept. 20. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures rose over 1 percent to their 5-1/2 month high of $1,364.10. Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world. Ukraine's government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days. China's first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest. In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock. PHYSICAL MARKETS Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices. In China, the world's biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20.

March 12, 2014, 1:17 pm

by Justin King

Automaker tells dealers not to use the allowance as a "sales tool."

General Motors has offered $500 towards the purchase of a new car for current owners who have been affected by the controversial ignition-switch recall.

The company cautions that it is not offering vehicle repurchases in response to the recall, however The Detroit News suggests the company already repurchased at least 13 Chevrolet Cobalts due to reports of the problem in 2005 in 2006. With more than 1.5 million vehicles involved in the recall, a broader buyback program would be unprecedented.

"To assist dealers in helping customers who are involved in this recall that request assistance, we are announcing a special cash allowance in the amount $500 available when these customers purchase or lease a new 2013/ 2014 / 2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac," the company wrote in a notice to dealers.

The discount program may mark one of the first moves to help mitigate a looming public-relations disaster, as the company faces separate investigations from the US House, Senate, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Justice Department.

At least 12 deaths have been officially associated on the issue, which can spontaneously shut off the engine and disable the airbags, though separate reports claim more than 50 people may have been killed in accidents caused by the defect.

The investigations primarily focus on why GM knew about the problems as early as 2004 but waited an entire decade before issuing a recall.##611|Empty##612|This will appear next to all of your comments

The figures, which the Colorado Department of Revenue said were in line with expectations, add to just over $1.4 million collected in taxes and fees on medical marijuana in the state in the same month.

The figures for recreational marijuana include revenues from a 2.9 percent sales tax, a special 10 percent tax on retail pot sales and a 15 percent excise tax imposed on growers, as well as licensing fees, the department said in a statement.

The numbers indicate the state’s recreational pot stores did about $14 million in gross sales for the month.

"We expect clear patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Barbara Pohl, executive director of the department.

Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the possession and use of small amounts recreational marijuana by adults age 21 or older in 2012, even as marijuana remains an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Colorado opened its retail pot shops in January, and Washington is slated to follow suit later this year.

Under the Colorado legalization law, the first $40 million collected annually from the excise tax is earmarked for school construction and repairs.

The state legislature will decide how to spend any leftover money from marijuana taxes and fees.

Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalization of recreational cannabis, has told lawmakers he would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programs to prevent youths from using the drug.##616|NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — General Motors knew of an issue with its ignition switch several years before it had previously acknowledged.

The company said in a federal filing Wednesday that it discovered an issue with the Saturn Ion ignition switch in 2001 during pre-production development. General Motors has previously said it first learned of ignition switch issues in 2004.

The document said a 2001 internal GM report noted “an ignition switch design change had solved the problem.”

It wasn’t clear from the document if the issue discovered in 2001 was related to the issue that led to the recently announced recall of 1.4 million cars in North America. The issue cited in the recall has been linked to at least 12 deaths. GM had originally reported at least 13 deaths, but revised that number after determining that one of the deaths had been counted twice.

GM said late Wednesday it has been conducting “a more in-depth analysis of the information related to the vehicles” it recalled.

“Today’s GM is fully committed to learning from the past while embracing the highest standards for quality and performance now and in the future,” said spokesman Alan Adler.

The issue behind the recall involves ignition switches that can be bumped out of the “Run” position into the “Off” or “Accessory” position. That can cause power braking and steering, as well as airbags, to stop working.

In 2004, a General Motors engineer accidentally knocked a vehicle out of “Run” while driving.

Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into the recall, as have members of Congress.

The recall includes the Saturn Ion and Sky, as well as the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR and the Pontiac G5 and Solstice.##617|Empty##618|Empty##619|Gold advanced to the highest level in almost six months as worsening tension between Ukraine and Russia boosted haven demand, with prices heading for the best run of weekly gains since August 2011.

Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.6% to US$1,375.17 an ounce, the highest level since Sept. 19, climbing for a third day. Gold traded at $1,369.34 at 3:04 pm in Singapore, poised for a sixth weekly gain.

The precious metal advanced 14% this year as demand for a store of value increased on the confrontation in Ukraine and concern growth in China is slowing. Crimea is preparing for a March 16 referendum that may pave the way for the Ukrainian region to join Russia. China’s retail sales, industrial output and investment last month trailed estimates, data showed Thursday.

“Gold should be supported as long as the situation in Ukraine remains uncertain,” said Zhu Siquan, an analyst at GF Futures Co., a unit of the Guangzhou-based company that bought Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. “Technically, gold is starting to look a bit overbought.”

Gold’s 14-day relative strength index climbed to 70, signaling to those who study charts that prices may be set to reverse. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust declined yesterday from the highest level this year, contracting for the first time since Feb. 19.

The confrontation in Ukraine has become the biggest between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War, with U.S. President Barack Obama and allies ratcheting up the threat of sanctions. Government officials and businessmen in Russia are readying for trade curbs resembling those applied to Iran, according to four people with knowledge of the preparations.

Massing Troops

Gold jumped 1.3% on Wednesday after Ukraine’s Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that Russia is massing troops near its border. Crimea can be integrated into Russia within two months if its voters decide the territory should cease to be a part of Ukraine, said the region’s Premier Sergei Aksenov.

Diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis continue today after Obama met Yatsenyuk yesterday and said the US stood with Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territory. US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in London, while Yatsenyuk is scheduled to speak to the United Nations Security Council.

Bullion rebounded this year even as the Federal Reserve, which next meets March 18-19, announced reductions to its bond- buying program at each of its past two meetings. Data today may show retail spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy, rose 0.2% in February from a month earlier.

Jitti Tangsithpakdi, president of the Gold Traders Association, anticipated that the gold price might climb to $1,400 an ounce due to speculation on news related to Ukraine and higher global demands particularly from China and India. India is likely to lift its tax collection on gold purchase.

He viewed that the global gold price this year would not drop below $1,050 an ounce but suggested investors to take only short-term investment as risk still persisted for the long term.

Mr Jitti said the association would discussed with Thailand Futures Exchange on the establishment of a centre to be the focal point on gold trading with foreign countries.

Futures Advance

Gold for April delivery climbed as much as 0.4% to $1,375.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the highest price since Sept. 19, and was at $1,369.70.

Silver for immediate delivery traded at $21.3064 an ounce from $21.3029 on Wednesday. Platinum fell 0.4% to $1,469.88 an ounce, while palladium was at $775.75 an ounce from $776.08 yesterday. China is the largest user of industrial metals.

Production losses at the world’s largest platinum companies caused by a seven-week strike on Thursday eclipsed those from stoppages in 2012 as talks over pay with the South African union leading the walkout remain deadlocked.##620|Empty##621|Empty##622|(Kitco News) - Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with modest gains Monday, supported on short covering by the shorter-term traders and on some bargain hunting. There may have been a bit of fresh safe-haven buying enter the gold market Monday, as news reports said more Russian troops were moving into Ukraine. April gold was last up $2.70 at $1,341.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $1.20 at $1,341.25. May Comex silver last traded down $0.043 at $20.885 an ounce.

The situation in Ukraine is presently simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place. However, reports Monday said that additional Russian troops have been moved to the Crimea region of Ukraine. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. This matter will likely limit selling pressure in gold for at least the near term.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week. The news also limited the upside in gold and silver markets Monday.

Follow me on Twitter @jimwyckoff##623|GOLD futures have edged higher, as a simmering geopolitical conflict in Ukraine and weaker US equities bolstered investor interest in haven assets.

Gold for April delivery, the most active contract, on Monday rose $US3.30, or 0.3 per cent, to settle at $US1,341.50 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Gold has marched higher in recent weeks, as investors stocked up on the store-of-value asset amid worries about the US economy and an escalating crisis in Eastern Europe. Some traders view gold as a hedge against political and economic uncertainty, because it tends to keep its value during periods of instability.

On Friday, a better-than-expected US jobs report interrupted gold's run higher. The data showed that businesses stepped up hiring in February, offsetting worries about the US labour market.

But gold prices turned higher on Monday, as investors shifted focus back to Ukraine amid reports that Russian troops and locals continued to besiege Ukrainian military bases in Crimea, halting delivery of food and supplies to some of them. Russian troops have been occupying Ukraine's Crimea region in a move that's sparked threats of economic and diplomatic sanctions from the US and its European allies.

"There's still enough people who want to hold gold as insurance," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading LLC.

A weaker tone to US equity markets also gave gold a boost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 16418.68.

Beijing has demanded Malaysia do more to find the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner. But despite sending nine ships to help in the search, China appears to have little leverage over its far smaller Southeast Asian neighbor.



The situation is especially uncomfortable for Chinese leaders because part of the ruling Communist Party's claim to a monopoly on power is that it is best qualified to look after the public's interests. The rise of social media and the increased willingness of China's public to assert its rights adds to the pressure to find the 154 Chinese among the 227 missing passengers.

There is "very likely a lot more pressure from the domestic community in China on Beijing to make sure that Chinese nationals are being protected," said Marc Lanteigne, research director at the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre at Victoria University of Wellington.



CBS News

Anxious relatives have thronged a temporary Malaysia Airlines office set up in a Beijing hotel and accuse Malaysian officials and the carrier of withholding information.

"Some of the information released by the Malaysian government and airline turns out to be true, some turns out to be false," said Nan Jinyan, a woman from Shanghai whose brother-in-law was aboard the flight. "I believe they are still deciding which information to release and which isn't convenient to release right now."

China has the world's second-largest military budget, at $114 billion last year, and has spent heavily on expanding the ability of its navy to project power farther from its shores. But the search that began in the Gulf of Thailand on the edge of the South China Sea, which China claims as its territorial waters, has relied heavily on expertise from the United States and Britain on the other side of the globe.

China is the biggest trading partner for most of its Asian neighbors, buying tens of billions of dollars' worth of raw materials and components from them annually. Yet despite such incentives for cooperation, countries from Vietnam to Australia are uneasy about China's ambitions, which has hampered its efforts to acquire influence.

Beijing has resorted to taking the unusual step of publicly haranguing Malaysia's government, a sign that whatever pressure it is applying in private is failing to produce results.

After Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday that the Boeing 777 might have flown beyond the current search area, Beijing reacted with fury, a sign that the announcement took it by surprise.



A deputy Chinese foreign minister demanded "more thorough and accurate information" about the new search area. A stinging commentary by China's official Xinhua News Agency accused Malaysia and the United States of dragging their feet.



"Given today's technology, the delay smacks of either dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information in a full and timely manner," Xinhua said. It said Malaysia "bears inescapable responsibility."

Xinhua said the plane's manufacturer, Boeing Co., and the maker of its engines, Britain's Rolls Royce plc, as well as "intelligence superpower the United States," with access to valuable information, "should also have done a better job."

China's unusually vehement public reaction has "gone beyond the diplomatic," said Carlyle Thayer, professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.



"To put it in public isn't helping," he said.

The rise of social media in China and the growing willingness of prosperous urban residents to assert their rights have added to pressure on Beijing to find the missing travelers.

Beijing is pressing for information "to show it is being a responsible government to the relatives of the passengers (and) to the Chinese public," said Liu Shanying, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.##626|The state’s new Obamacare healthcare exchange had enrolled more than 150,000 people as of March 9, surpassing its self-imposed goal of enrolling 100,000 residents by 50%.

Access Health CT is the entity established by the state of Connecticut to sign up people for healthcare coverage through the new federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Enrollment began last October.

Potential penalty for not signing up

According to federal law, residents must sign up for healthcare coverage or receive an exemption from coverage by March 31 to avoid a tax penalty. For 2014, the federal government will assess a penalty of 1% of a gross household income over the federal income tax filing threshold or $95 per individual, whichever amount is greater.

People can sign up for healthcare insurance online at www.accesshealthct.com, or call 855-805-4325 to speak with an Access Health CT representative.

‘There’s still time’

“If you haven’t signed up yet, there’s still time to visit our website, call our call center, visit an enrollment center or make an appointment for one-on-one assistance.,” said Kevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health CT.

Connecticut’s sign-up rate appears to be one of the better ones in the country, although critics point out the figures include a substantial number of people who were already receiving health insurance through government assistance programs prior to the new federal law — and not just people who previously were uninsured.

The figures for Connecticut

According to Access Health CT, the enrollment numbers for the state as of the close of business March 9 were:

Unique website visitors — 710,638

Calls answered at call center — 275,111

His continuing occupation of Ukraine is completely unacceptable, and Russia’s President should be isolated for his actions.

It is America’s duty to condemn these actions in no uncertain terms. It is our role as a global leader to be the strongest nation in opposing Russia’s latest aggression.

Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation.

This does not and should not require military action. No one in the U.S. is calling for this. But it will require other actions and leadership, both of which President Obama unfortunately lacks.

I recommend a number of specific and decisive measures to punish Putin for his ongoing aggression.

Economic sanctions and visa bans should be imposed and enforced without delay. I would urge our European allies to leverage their considerable weight with Russia and take the lead on imposing these penalties. I would do everything in my power to aggressively market and export America’s vast natural gas resources to Europe.

I would immediately remove every obstacle or current ban blocking the export of American oil and gas to Europe, and I would lift restrictions on new oil and gas development in order to ensure a steady energy supply at home and so we can supply Europe with oil if it is interrupted from Ukraine.

Because of so many of our current needless laws and regulations, President Obama has left Europe completely vulnerable because of its dependence on Russian oil and gas.

I would support immediate construction of the Keystone Pipeline.

It is important that Russia become economically isolated until all its forces are removed from Crimea and Putin pledges to act in accordance with the international standards of behavior that respect the rights of free people everywhere.

We should also suspend American loans and aid to Ukraine because currently these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia. Ukraine owes so much money to Russia that America would essentially be borrowing from China to give to Russia.

The U.S. should suspend its participation in this summer’s G-8 summit and take the lead in boycotting the event in Sochi. If Putin’s troops remain in Crimea at the time of the summit, Russia should be expelled from the group.

I would reinstitute the missile-defense shields President Obama abandoned in 2009 in Poland and the Czech Republic, only this time, I would make sure the Europeans pay for it. The problem with the foreign policies of both Democratic and Republican administrations is that they never give a second thought to how America can afford what they implement.

America is a world leader, but we should not be its policeman or ATM.

At the end of the day, I still agree with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen — the greatest threat to America’s security is our national debt.

Russia, the Middle East or any other troubled part of the world should never make us forget that the U.S. is broke. We weaken our security and defenses when we print money out of thin air or borrow from other countries to allegedly support our own.

Like Dwight Eisenhower, I believe the U.S. can actually be stronger by doing less.

Like Ronald Reagan, particularly regarding Russia, I also believe, “Don’t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.”

I stand with the people of Ukraine against subjugation and support their efforts to restore freedom. The Ukrainian people must be free to determine the fate and future of their own nation without unwarranted military or political intimidation from Russia.

Reagan’s policy of “peace through strength” requires strength of the sort President Obama now fails to project. But what some American leaders, including some in my own party, often forget is that lasting peace was always Reagan’s ultimate objective.

I have said, and some have taken exception, that too many U.S. leaders still think in Cold War terms and are quick to “tweak” the international community. This is true.

But mutual respect and practical diplomacy is a two-way street, where Russia or any other nation should not be tweaking us, or their neighbors, either.

Putin’s invasion and occupation of Crimea certainly now go far beyond tweaking.

The U.S., in cooperation with the international community, should respond to Russia’s aggression with action.

The Budapest Memorandum said that Russia wouldn’t violate the integrity of Ukraine, but now it has. There is no realistic military option in this conflict, at least for the U.S. But this does not mean there aren’t options, many of which I’ve outlined here.

The real problem is that Russia’s President is not currently fearful or threatened in any way by America’s President, despite his country’s blatant aggression.

But let me be clear: If I were President, I wouldn’t let Vladimir Putin get away with it.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said the "heavyweight figure" will examine the central bank's actions in relation to the allegations and how it handled them.

The bank has already appointed the law firm Travers Smith to prepare a report on the affair which will be made public.

However, the Sunday Telegraph said Travers Smith is on a fact finding exercise rather than an inquiry.

The Bank of England has suspended an employee as part of an internal probe into what Bank officials knew about alleged manipulation of key currency rates by traders.

The BoE also released on Wednesday minutes of meetings between its FX officials and chief dealers in London stretching back over several years that showed concerns over possible manipulation were raised as far back as 2006.

Regulators have said the alleged manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day market - the world's largest financial market - is as bad as the Libor interest rate rigging which has resulted in banks shelling out $6 billion in fines and settlements.

Foyle is accused of a serious offence, which makes his hunt for a murderer even harder.##639|Among the companies with shares expected to actively trade in Tuesday’s session are American Eagle Outfitters Inc., Boyd Gaming Corp. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc.##640|BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - China’s economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows, a surprisingly weak performance that raises the spectre of a sharper cooldown.

The weaker-than-expected data is bound to amplify global investors’ worries about slackening growth in the world’s second-largest economy, and will almost certainly feed speculation that Beijing may loosen policies soon to bolster growth.

China’s industrial output rose 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014 from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, missing market expectations for a 9.5 percent rise.

That marked the worst performance for China’s factory output growth since April 2009.

“Policy easing should be imminent,” said Hao Zhou, an economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai, adding that Thursday’s data implied that China’s economy may grow 7 percent in the first quarter.

Sources told Reuters earlier this week that China’s central bank is prepared to take its strongest action since 2012 to loosen monetary policy if economic growth slows further, by cutting the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves.

A cut would be triggered if growth slips below 7.5 percent and towards 7.0 percent, and would be expected only in the second quarter, according to the sources who are involved in internal policy discussions.

Other sectors of the economy also appeared to have lost steam.

Growth in retail sales was the slowest in three years, up 11.8 percent in January and February compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected a rise of 13.5 percent.

Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, fared even worse. It was up 17.9 percent in the first two months from the same period last year, a level unseen in 11 years and some way below forecasts for a 19.4 percent increase.

Asian stock markets and most regional currencies such as the Australian dollar and China’s offshore yuan pared early gains after the data was released.

COOLING, BUT HOW FAST?

The statistics bureau released combined data for January and February in a bid to reduce distortions seen in single-month data caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, when factories, offices and shops often close for long periods.

Trade data last week showed January-February exports fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, and tumbled 18.1 percent in February alone, alarming financial markets.

Many analysts believe Beijing will not consider further easing until more months of data are available.

But even accounting for holiday-related shutdowns and distortions, the broader weaker trend so far in 2014 appears clear.

China’s government, which wrapped up its annual parliament meeting on Thursday, had said last week that it aims to grow the economy by 7.5 percent this year.

But with growth appearing to drop faster and sharper than what many have expected, some economists believe that China may actually miss its growth target this year for the first time in years.

Even government officials are hinting that the target is not cast in stone, in what may be an attempt to guide market expectations lower. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei and Premier Li Keqiang have both said that the target is flexible.##641|The mystery of where the missing Malaysia Air Flight 370 Boeing 777 could have flown heightened as the disappearance entered its tenth day. The search area was once again expanded with a renewed urgency by Malaysian officials in reaction to international criticism that information was not being timely shared. Officials are now looking at the possibility that the aircraft was flown at low altitude to avoid radar detection. This low level flight would have had to occur after the aircraft left Malaysian airspace as the Malaysian military has reported spotting the aircraft on radar over its airspace. If the aircraft was flown at low altitudes, it would significantly alter the aircraft's range as airliners are not designed to fly efficiently at low altitudes. The amount of fuel burn increases dramatically at low altitude and the aircraft's range is correspondingly reduced, changing once again the search focus.

At an evening press conference in Kuala Lumpur, early morning on the US East Coast, Malaysia's Acting Minister of Transportation defended his country's handling of the disappearance of the Boeing 777 aircraft, claiming it needed to verify information before sharing it with the international community to avoid expending assets inappropriately. The official stated that 26 countries are now assisting in the search with countries in the flight corridors being asked to provide radar and satellite data for analysis and aircraft and ships for the physical search. Other countries like China and France are being asked for technical assistance. The Malaysian official claimed that US investigators have been involved from the beginning, including the FBI.

Malaysia's recent efforts to involve the international community are a welcome development but their delay may come at a high price, both in terms of delay in finding the aircraft and needless expenditure of assets tracking down incorrect information. For example, substantial assets were expended searching the intended flight path between Malaysia and Vietnam when Malaysian authorities had radar data showing the 777 had flown to across Malaysia and towards the Indian Ocean.##642|The stock price of Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) dropped more than 7% to $60.57 per share after its disclosure that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a civil investigation against it.

The trading of the shares of Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) and the stock of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were temporarily stopped at around 1:18 in the afternoon, Eastern Time to announce the action of the regulator.

The multilevel marketing (MLM) company selling nutritional and weight loss supplements has been the center of controversy since activist invest investor, Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management alleged that it is a pyramid scheme.

Ackman’s new presentation on Herbalife China

Prior to the inquiry of the FTC, Bill Ackman and the management of Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) exchanged sharp comments. Yesterday, the activist investor gave a new presentation that the business practices of the company violate regulations in China based on result of the investigation of OTG Research, which was hired by Pershing Square. Ackman said Herbalife’s “hourly consulting pay” is the key to prove that it breaks China’s laws because its distributors are paid based on the number of their recruits.

In response to Ackman’s presentation, Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) expressed confidence with its business in China and emphasized that it is built on customers benefiting from and enjoying its products. The company said it will continue to invest in China and to collaborate with the Chinese government to deliver high-quality nutrition to consumers in the country through lawful direct selling practices.

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) added, “The presentation reflects Mr. Ackman’s continued failure to fundamentally understand Herbalife’s business model.”

Herbalife welcomes FTC inquiry

With regard to FTC’s civil investigation, Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) stated that it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace.” The company also said that it will “cooperate fully” with the regulator.

“We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years,” added Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF).

Equity risk

Given the FTC investigation, it is reasonable to say that shares of Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) would be volatile or at risk over the next few days or even weeks/months not until the regulator clears the company from wrong doing. Take note that, there are also requests to the office of attorneys generals in various states across the country to look into the business practices of the company.

Smasrtstops.net, an equity risk management firm immediately released a risk alert to its subscribers regarding the stock. The firm shows that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is current at elevated risk. Investors who pulled back their investment on the stock when it entered its current risk state saved $20.15 per share as illustrated above.##643|KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The search for the missing Malaysian jet pushed deep into the northern and southern hemispheres Monday as Australia took the lead in scouring the seas of the southern Indian Ocean and Kazakhstan -- about 10,000 miles to the northwest -- answered Malaysia's call for help in the unprecedented hunt.

French investigators arriving to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals -- but investigators say the Malaysian airliner's communications links were deliberately severed ahead of its mysterious disappearance more than a week ago.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.

Malaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots' home on March 9, the day after the flight.

Investigators haven't ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight's last words -- "All right, good night" -- to ground controllers.

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots -- or someone else -- without the other pilot's knowledge.

Malaysia's government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

Over the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 AA1/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.

The northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan -- all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.

An official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to questions on radar information.

Indonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country's search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the "ill-fated aircraft" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia's leader.

"Australia will do its duty in this matter," Abbott told parliament. "We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."

Australia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

China's largest Twitter-like service Weibo has unveiled plans to sell shares on the US stock market.

Weibo, owned by Chinese internet giant Sina, is looking to raise $500m (£300m) via the share sale.

However, the firm did not give details of the number of shares it plans to sell or the price range.

According to papers filed with the US regulators, it had 129.1 million monthly active users in December and generated revenues of $188m in 2013.

"A microcosm of Chinese society, Weibo has attracted a wide range of users, including ordinary people, celebrities and other public figures, as well as organisations such as media outlets, businesses, government agencies and charities," the firm said in its filing.

Booming market

We expect our advertising and marketing revenues to increase in the foreseeable future Weibo

China's internet market has grown to become the world's biggest with more than 500 million users.

With major global social networking firms such as Facebook and Twitter blocked in the country, domestic companies have benefitted the most from this growth.

The popularity of services such as Weibo has also been driven in part by the fact that they gave users a platform to share unfiltered information.

As more people have got on the social media bandwagon, revenues at firms operating these services have also risen.

Weibo said its revenues nearly tripled in 2013 from a year earlier, as more companies advertised on the platform in an attempt to attract perspective customers.

The firm said it expects the trend to continue.

"We expect our advertising and marketing revenues to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to introduce new advertising and marketing solutions and attract more customers," it said.

Slowdown concerns

However, the growing popularity of social media platforms has also attracted the attention of authorities who have moved swiftly to silence voices online.

A law has been introduced to allow the Chinese government to jail microbloggers and dozens were arrested last year. That has seen many users ditch the platforms in favour of mobile messaging services.

A report published last month indicated that the number of Weibo users declined steeply in 2013.

The China Internet Network Information Center said in its annual report that almost 28 million people abandoned Weibo last year.

The fall marked the site's first drop in usage amid a government crackdown on so-called 'rumour mongers' online.

That has triggered some concerns over whether firms such as Weibo will be able to sustain the rapid pace of growth seen in recent years.

The firm itself has highlighted the area as a potential risk.

"If people do not perceive content and other products and services on our platform to be interesting and useful, we may not be able to attract users or increase the frequency of their engagement," it said.

"A number of user-oriented websites that achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously."##646|Indonesian Air Force officials at Medan city military base plot the Indonesian military search operation for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 on March 12, 2014 in the area of Malacca Strait, a sea passageway between Indonesia (seen left of the map) and Malaysia (seen right on the map).

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (CBS News/CBSDC/AP) — Search planes dispatched Thursday to examine an area where Chinese satellite images showed what might have been debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 found nothing, officials told CBS News.

The Malaysian Air Force director of operations told CBS News in Kuala Lumpur that planes sent up based on the Chinese satellite images from Sunday, the day after Flight 370 went missing south of Vietnam, had located no debris.

Later Thursday, Malaysian civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman reiterated the latest bad news in the search for the plane. “There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,” he told reporters.

Separately, a Reuters journalist who was on board a Vietnamese search aircraft dispatched to the same area Thursday, said no debris was spotted.

“Aircraft repeatedly circled the area over the South China Sea but were unable to detect any objects,” Reuters reported.

Read: Mall Shooter Was Obsessed With Columbine

The hunt for Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, has been punctuated by false leads since it disappeared with 239 people aboard just hours after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday. The plane was heading east over the South China Sea when it disappeared, but authorities believe it may have turned back and headed into the upper reaches of the Strait and Malacca or beyond.

Meanwhile, Malaysia’s acting Transport Minister, Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, flatly rejected a report from The Wall Street Journal claiming U.S. investigators suspect the plane flew for as long as four hours — possibly hundreds of miles — after it lost contact with ground control.

The Journal, citing “two people familiar with the details,” said data automatically downloaded from the plane’s Rolls Royce Trent 800 engines as part of a maintenance program continued to reach the ground for four hours after the flight went off radar.

“Those reports are inaccurate,” said Hussein. He said the last transmission of data from Flight 370 came prior to the loss of the plane’s signal on radar and communications with the crew, and indicated “everything was normal.”

“As far as Rolls Royce and Boeing are concerned, those reports are inaccurate,” said Hussein.

The debris in the Chinese images was not far from the last confirmed position of the plane, between Malaysia and Vietnam. The images and coordinates were posted on the website of China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

A Xinhua report said the images, from around 11 a.m. on Sunday, appear to show “three suspected floating objects” of varying sizes in a 12-and-a-half mile radius, the largest about 79-by-72 feet, off the southern tip of Vietnam.

Malaysia’s civil aviation chief, Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said Malaysia had not been officially informed by China about the images, something he said was a “a breach of protocol.”

He noted the general area had been searched several times and the images were taken on Sunday. “There have been lots of reports of suspected debris,” he said.

Li Jiaxiang, chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said later China had yet to confirm any link between the floating objects and the plane.

Malaysia has come under some criticism for its handling of the search, which currently covers 35,800 square miles and involves 12 nations.

On Wednesday, Malaysian government officials told passengers’ relatives that the last words of the captain to air traffic control indicated nothing was wrong. But with no confirmed trace of the jet, the words did nothing to calm waiting friends and families.

Banana growers could be squeezed further by the merger between two of the world’s biggest merchants, the Fairtrade Foundation has warned.

Fyffes, the 126-year-old fruit supplier famous for its blue-label branding, is to become half of the world’s biggest banana company by merging with Chiquita, its larger American rival, the companies said yesterday.

Chiquita and Fyffes sell a combined 160 million boxes of bananas a year, which would put the new group comfortably ahead of its rivals Del Monte, which sells 117 million boxes a year, and Dole, which sells 110 million. The four companies control most of the global market.

The Fed started to reduce its bond purchases in January as it gauged the economy to be strong enough to withstand the move.

Janet Yellen will also answer reporters' questions Wednesday in her first press conference as Fed Chair since taking over from Ben Bernanke in February. She does not want to "rock the boat" says BNP economist Julia Coronado, and will likely signal that the Fed has no intention of altering course as it gradually reins in the stimulus program known as "quantitative easing." The Fed's balance sheet has ballooned to above $4.1 trillion as a result of its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, up from $869 billion in August 2007.

Like other economists, Coronado says the Fed may also reduce the threshold it has set for beginning to raise short-term interest rates. The Fed has linked that to a jobless rate of 6.5% or so. But the unemployment rate has already fallen to 6.7%, and with the Fed likely to keep rates close to 0 into 2015, an adjustment in the target rate seems necessary.

Related: Jobs better-than-expected but "the labor market is still weak": NYT's Greenhouse

"The Fed will abandon those numerical thresholds," Coronado explains in the video above. "At least half of the decline in the unemployment rate is due to falling labor participation, a sign of weakness." But the jobs report was not the "decisive factor" in the change, she adds.

"The Fed never reacts to just one data point and it's willing to look through a lot of the weakness we've seen in hiring and other data reflective of the severe winter weather," Coronado says.

Even as the Fed further reduces its stimulus program, Coronado argues that $55 billion in monthly bond purchases is "still a lot of money" to inject into the economy. That stimulus will keep the markets "resilient" and prolong higher interest rates for a lot longer.

Online games designer King Digital, which is domiciled in Dublin but based in Tottenham Court Road, has set a price of between US$21-24 per share a level, which values the company at more than US$7.5bn at the top end.

It is staggering valuation for a company that generates three quarters of its revenues from Candy Crush, but technology IPOs have been among the hottest properties on Wall Street in recent months following the success of the listing of ( ) and ( ) last year.

Candy Crush, where you sort sweets into lines, was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and generated the most revenue of any mobile app. As players progress through its levels they have to pay for add-ons and enhancements.

King was founded in 2003 by Zacconi and Toby Rowland, son of former Lonrho chief executive Roland “Tiny” Rowland and originally to supply online gaming products.

Since Candy Crush was launched in 2012, however, the game for the company has literally changed beyond all recognition.

King has other games, around 180 in total, but the bulk of its US$160mln profits and $600mln revenues in the final quarter of 2013 came from Candy Crush.

Zacchoni’s stake is now expected to be worth up US$750mln or even more when the shares start trading on 26 March.

The company will raise more than US$533 mln through the sale of 15.5mln shares, with 6.6mln to be sold by King employees and other shareholders.

King will be hoping to avoid the fate of Farmville originator of ( ), the company behind Farmville, whose popularity waned, leading to falling player numbers and job losses, as well as a share price plunge.##651|Italy's largest bank Unicredit said Tuesday it had suffered a staggering 14 billion euro ($19.4 billion) loss last year as it wrote down the value of assets and increased its loan loss provisions.

The bank also unveiled a strategic plan that targets generating over 6 billion euros in annual net profits in four years.

The loss was essentially due to writing down the value of assets by 9.3 billion euros and increasing reserves to cover at risk loans by 7.2 billion euros in the final quarter of last year.

It also took a restructuring charge of 699 million euros.

Eurozone banks have been under pressure to clean up their balance sheets before the European Central Bank conducts its review of the books of the biggest lenders in the single currency bloc as it prepares to take over as the banking regulator.

Unicredit, which posted a net profit of 865 million euros in 2012, also announced a plan under which it quickly intends to boost profitability.

"Whilst in 2014 we estimate a net profit around 2 billion euros, we intend to more than triple this to 6.6 billion euros in 2018," chief executive Federico Ghizzoni was quoted as saying.

The bank also said it intends to distribute about 40 percent of profits to shareholders.

Ghizzoni said the strategic plan "is based on solid fundamentals, a strong risk culture and an improving macro-economic climate."

He said this involves investment of 4.5 billion euros to grow revenues and to cut an additional 1.3 billion euros in costs.

The bank said it has made considerable progress in reducing the risk in its business, with its leverage ratio down to assets of 19 times its capital from 32 before the global financial crisis struck.

And it has reduced its funding gap to 29 billion euros from 163 billion, while increasing its coverage rate for impaired loans and capital base ratios.

Unicredit shares jumped 5.5 percent to 6.38 euros while the Milan market added 0.67 percent overall.##652|More Americans rode trains, buses, streetcars and subways last year than at any time since 1956. That's according to new figures released by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). In fact, more than 10.7 billion journeys were made by public transit nationally, and transit ridership is up 37.2 percent since 1995.

So what's going on?

Certainly, as the APTA notes, the economic recovery will be playing a role. But there are broader trends that point to a long-term growth in ridership, including increased urbanization.

Here's how The Guardian explains the shift:

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs. “People want to work and live along transit lines,” said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – With the clock running down on Obamacare enrollment, the administration sought to persuade young people to sign up for health coverage on Tuesday by telling them how much it hurts not be insured – that is, how much it can hurt the wallet.

Take the humble ankle sprain, one of the most common injuries among young adults under the age of 25. Treating it can cost $2,290. Then there’s the broken arm: On average $7,700. And people without health insurance get to pay full freight.

Or as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius put it in a government blog: “This can be a huge financial blow to young people and families alike.”

That is the message the administration hopes will be heard by college-age kids and others who do not have health insurance, but could qualify for federal subsidies to help purchase coverage. Some could also qualify for the Medicaid health program for the poor.

Open enrollment ends March 31.

In a promotion aimed at fans of the annual college basketball playoff series known as March Madness, Sebelius’ Department of Health and Human Services and the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition released data looking at the economic costs of common sports injuries like sprains and fractures – just the sort of thing to send a young person to the emergency room.

Young people are vital to the success of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Obamacare prevents insurance companies from penalizing people who are sick or older. And so the new marketplaces need young people who are cheaper to insure to make up for the higher financial risks posed by others.

But so far, the administration’s target audience of people aged 18 to 34 have not been signing up in such large numbers, a trend that could lead to higher insurance costs down the road if it continues.

More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare, according to the administration. But the latest breakdown shows the number of younger adults stuck at 25 percent of the enrollment population, versus the 38 percent target that the administration laid out before last October’s botched rollout.

Administration officials say younger people could sign up in huge numbers in the final days of the open enrollment period.

Marijuana taxes net

$2 million in January

Colorado made about $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Revenue Department indicates that $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected about $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Sales in Washington state will begin in the coming months.

The pot taxes come from a 12.9 percent sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax. Voters approved the taxes last year. They said that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go toward school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Methodist Church

drops marriage case

The United Methodist Church announced on Monday that it is dropping its case against a New York clergyman accused of defying church policy by officiating at his son’s same-sex wedding.

The church said a trial over the actions of the Rev. Thomas Ogletree, a former dean at Yale University’s divinity school, could cause “harmful polarization” during the ongoing debate about the church’s stance on same-sex unions.

The move came three months after a Pennsylvania pastor was defrocked after he was found guilty of officiating at his son’s same-sex wedding. Instead of facing trial, Ogletree will participate in conversations about the church’s policy on such unions.

(HTZ) said that its fourth-quarter net loss attributable to stockholders was $0.6 million or break even per share, compared to a loss of $36.8 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Fourth quarter 2013 adjusted net income was $121.1 million, versus $139.1 million in the same period of 2012, resulting in adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of 2013 of $0.26, compared to $0.33 for the fourth quarter of 2012. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $0.32 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.

Quarterly worldwide revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 10.2% year-over-year. Nine analysts estimated revenues of $2.62 billion for the quarter.

The company forecasts first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of between $0.07 and $0.09, reflecting the impact, estimated at $0.07 to $0.08 adjusted earnings per share this quarter, of excess U.S. rental car fleet, although it expects fleet levels to be aligned with transaction day growth by the end of this quarter. Analysts project first-quarter earnings of $0.19 per share.

The company expects full year 2014 revenues in the range of $11.400 billion - $11.700 billion based on U.S. and International RAC revenue growth forecasted between 6% and 8% and 5% to 7%, respectively. Annual adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.70 - $2.00. Street currently is looking for fiscal year 2014 earnings of $2.07 per share on annual revenues of $11.60 billion.

The full text of the plan released on Sunday night showed that Beijing wants to raise the proportion of urban residents to about 60 per cent of the total population by 2020, from the current 53.7 per cent. The proportion of people registered under urban households is targeted to rise to about 45 per cent from 36 per cent over the same period.

China's goal remains far below the average urbanisation rate of about 80 per cent in developed nations, but boosting the rates requires an intense effort to overhaul the fiscal, land, and social welfare system, analysts say. The plan is designed to spawn a consumption-driven, greener growth model in a shift from the old pattern, which was typified by heavy capital spending and high environmental costs.

Watch: China's urban drive risks digging economic hole

Qiao Runling, a vice-director at the China Centre for Urban Development under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said: "The blueprint centres on moving migrant workers into cities, transforming [the] growth model to low-carbon and green development, and improving the structure of cities."

The blueprint centres on moving migrant workers into cities, transforming the growth model to low-carbon and green development, and improving the structure of cities

Qiao Runling, a vice-director at the China Centre for Urban Development

He told the Post: "It's no longer an emphasis on enclosing land, adding investment, and constructing properties."

Migrant workers moving into cities are expected to consume more food, buy houses and home appliances, and join transport networks. Local governments are expected to include them in the social and medical insurance coverage for urban areas.

"There wouldn't be a second 'four-trillion-yuan' stimulus," Qiao said, referring to a stimulus package rolled out by Beijing during the global financial crisis to combat economic slowdown, a policy that fuelled high inflation, asset bubbles, and overcapacity. Economic growth cooled to 7.7 per cent last year after peaking at more than 14 per cent in 2007.

But Qiao said implementation would be much more complicated and pilot trials would be conducted across the nation first.

The government plans to guide some labour-intensive industries to move to central and western regions from the affluent eastern coast. It aims to develop a few city clusters in areas including the Chengdu -Chongqing region in the west, central China, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.

The government also plans to expand railways, roads, highways, and airlines to facilitate labour flows.

Cities will be encouraged to develop strategic industries such as information technology, biology and renewable energy.

A more market-based investment and financing system with participants from private enterprises will be established to cut local authorities' reliance on land sales.

The government also plans to reform the rural land ownership system, a major problem that has discouraged many farmers from moving to cities for fear of losing their land permanently.

Beijing also aims to boost air quality, ensuring 60 per cent of cities meet national pollution standards by 2020.

"The blueprint will help narrow the gap between urban and rural areas," said Wang Jun, a senior researcher with the China Centre for International Economic Exchange, a government think tank. But he cautioned that: "There is a long way to go, as China's fiscal strength and public services networks will take time to catch up."

Beijing has repeatedly suspended the rolling out of the urbanisation plan in the past two years. President Xi Jinping , taking office in the autumn of 2012, rejected a proposal last year as it focused more on expanding investment than improving livelihoods, according to people familiar with the talks.

The central government will oversee the design of the overall urbanisation strategy, while the NDRC will be responsible for making detailed plans.##671|In yet another blow, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an import alert on pharmaceutical company Sun Pharma for all products manufactured at its Karkhadi unit. The unit makes active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and formulations.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, pharma analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher Surajit Pal said import alert generally means stalling of revenue for a year or two from the plant under vigilance. "But we need to see the quantum of revenue it generates from the plant and the kind of cost they saved by producing API from there because we also know that they supply API to their Caraco unit and they also enjoy the low cost API from Indian plant."

Earlier in the week, the pharma major had recalled 2,528 bottles of its generic version of diabetes drug Glumetza from US-based Santarus Inc after it received a customer complaint.

The company's subsidiary Caraco on Wednesday had received approval from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for making Risperidone oral tablets. Risperidone is used to treat schizophrenia.

Earlier Ranbaxy and Wockhardt had come under USFDA scanner. Discussing the turn of events, Nilesh Shah of Envision Capital told CNBC-TV18 that the penalty on Karkhadi unit is reminiscent of the way Ranbaxy was examined by the USFDA. 'It started with import alert on one plant, but gradually the rest of it came under scrutiny."##672|Hello

MUMBAI, India -- Toyota said Monday it has shut down production at its two auto-assembly plants in India, locking out 6,400 workers amid testy wage negotiations and allegations of threats against management.

A statement from the Indian unit of the world's largest automaker said that "under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors." It said the company had no other option but to declare a lockout "to ensure the safety" of workers and management.

The union could not immediately be reached for comment due to a public holiday in India.

Toyota Motor Corp. spokesman Naoki Sumino in Tokyo said there have been no injuries or damage at its two plants.

In 2012, rioting workers at a New Delhi factory owned by India's largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, killed a company manager and injured dozens. That factory was closed for nearly a month, which analysts estimated cost the subsidiary of Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. about $18 million a day.

This week's Toyota lockout comes after negotiations that began in April last year and arbitration talks that failed earlier this year.

The two plants outside Bangalore produce 310,000 vehicles a year, including the Innova van, Fortuner sport-utility vehicle, Corolla subcompact and Etios models.

Toyota has been eager to expand in India with sales of its affordable models.

Toyota's Indian subsidiary, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Ltd., was set up in 1997 with the Japanese company owning an 89 per cent share and its local partner, the Kirloskar Group conglomerate, owning 11 per cent.

The company recently celebrated the sale of its millionth car in India.##678|Empty##679|US stocks traded lower yesterday led by a surprise decline in Chinese exports numbers released over the weekend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.21% while S&P 500 was doing slightly better at -0.05%. A decline in stocks was already highly expected as Asian counterparts were trading deeply in the red with the Nikkei 225 shedding well over 1% and the China CSI 300 index falling to multi-year lows. What is actually surprising is that US stock prices did not push much lower. In fact, the risk sensitive Nasdaq 100 index actually traded marginally higher (+0.08%) for all the talk about risk appetite being bearish due to China's economic woes.

Hourly Chart

S&P 500 Hourly

Furthermore, we can see from S&P 500 futures that prices actually recovered and even traded above Friday's closing level at one point during early European hours. This move is totally inexplicable as there weren't any economic news releases during the period to justify a shift in market sentiment. Therefore, the only reasonable explanation would be that overall market sentiment for US stocks remains broadly bullish, with traders still looking out for bargain buys. This assertion would explain why prices rebounded strongly not once but twice yesterday, around 1,870 soft support.

However, global sentiment remains bearish, and as such we should only expect US stocks (S&P 500 in this case) to be better supported rather than outright climbing much higher. Technicals agree in this regard, with price finding difficulty breaking 1,880 resistance. The Stochastic indicator also suggests that bullish momentum may find further bullish endeavours unlikely as momentum is already Overbought with a bearish cycle signal likely to be triggered in the near future. This implies that a move toward 1,870 is possible, giving us a sideways trend in the short-term until global risk appetite starts to build up once again or if sentiment of US stocks shift.

Daily Chart

S&P 500 Daily

Looking at the daily chart, it is easy to understand why traders are still bullish, as price action suggest that bullish momentum remains strong with a fresh bullish breakout happening just last week, negating the threat of a top forming around 1,850. However, it should still be noted that current bullish momentum is actually rather overbought as we have not seen a significant pullback in prices since the start of the current bull run, from late 2012/early 2013.

If we use the widely accepted definition of a continuous bull trend (no 20% correction between rallies), then this trend has been ongoing for close to 5 years, which is considered a relatively long run judging by historical data. Furthermore, it should be noted that this bull run has been funded by borrowed money - margin debt purchases. All this increases high downside risk going forward. Traders will definitely need to be prepared for huge sharp drops moving forward should they choose to join in the bullish momentum this late in the game.

Original post##680|Five years ago today the stock market, reeling from the financial crisis, hit bottom. The Dow (^DJI) closed at just under 6,500 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended at 676.5. Since March 9, 2009, the Dow and the S&P 500 have more than doubled but how much longer can this rally last?

No one knows the answer, of course, but there are reasons to be cautious. Here are five of them:

1. Tenure: The average bull market lasts about 4.5 years. Only three of the 11 previous bull markets (excluding this one), celebrated a sixth birthday.

2. Valuation: Profit growth is slowing and revenue growth is sluggish, but the price-to-earnings-ratio for the S&P 500 is still strong--about 16 times earnings for the past 12 months. That's near the peak reached in October 2007, just before stocks began their decline during the financial crisis.

3. Margin debt: It's been rising since June and reached a record $488 billion in January. Investors are borrowing to invest, which is a euphoric sign, says Phil Pearlman, interactive editor at Yahoo Finance. And too much euphoria in the stock market is considered a sign of vulnerability. But Pearlman notes that a major reason for rising margin debt is that the cheap cost of borrowing due to extremely low interest rates.

4. The Fed: the U.S. central bank is reducing its purchases of mortgage debt and long-term Treasuries, which have kept long-term rates low and helped fuel the stock market rally. Many strategists say Fed policy is THE key factor for the stock market rally so less Fed asset purchases means less support for the rally.

5. Biotech weakening. Pearlman says biotech stocks have been a leader in the bull market but have been selling off lately. Over the past two weeks the Nasdaq Biotech index (IBB) has fallen 2.3% while the Nasdaq has gained 1.6% and the S&P 500 and Dow are both up about 2%.



Biotechs have been lagging big-cap growth stocks like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Priceline (PCLN) and Netflix (NFLX), which have also outperformed in the current rally, says Pearlman. "Keep an eye on biotechs and large-cap growth stocks," he warns. "When they [both] start to roll over that would be a second signal that momentum is waning."

That should allow it to quickly shed an estimated $140 million in debt, and emerge from bankruptcy as a healthier company.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.67% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2018. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Helping the Dow move decisively higher has been a steady recovery in the U.S. economy, aided by a double-digit rise in home prices, a precipitous fall in the unemployment rate, improving worker productivity, and the continuation of historically low lending rates.

But are things really as they appear?

Two months ago we looked at three variables that may be inflating how strong the U.S. economy actually looks. The first is the labor participation rate, which has been falling consistently for the past 14 years. Some of this drop is expected as baby boomers hit their retirement age and others go back to school, but a growing concern is that some people have simply given up on finding work. Comparing the current number of employed workers with those in mid-2008, you'd see that job creation is basically flat.

Second, the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus, QE3, has been a boost for the housing and banking sector, but has spoiled the U.S. consumer by keeping rates too low for too long, By artificially keeping rates low and reducing this sense of urgency, consumers have drastically cut back on loan originations anytime lending rates tick up in the slightest.

Finally, a combination of stock buybacks and cost-cutting has helped push corporate earnings higher, but it's also masking what has generally been weak organic growth.

With these points in mind, I suggest we do what we do every month, which is to take a closer look at the Dow's five most hated companies -- in essence, the five stocks with the highest level of short interest -- to better understand what characteristics, if any, are attracting short-sellers so we can avoid buying similar stocks in the future.

Here are the Dow's five most hated stocks.

Company Short Interest As a % of Outstanding Shares Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) 5.96% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 4.20% AT&T 3.29% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 2.90% IBM (NYSE:IBM) 2.58%

Caterpillar

Why are investors shorting Caterpillar?

The bet against heavy-duty machinery manufacturer Caterpillar has grown dramatically within just the past month, rising from 3.46% last month to 5.96% this month. The reason for the recent run higher was its sizable earnings beat in the fourth quarter, which was a complete surprise after Caterpillar had lowered its earnings guidance on three separate occasions last year. Short-sellers are betting that this past quarter, which was aided primarily by cost-cutting, was nothing more than a fluke, and that weak mining demand will continue to weigh on Caterpillar's share price.

Is this short interest warranted?

With Caterpillar's management remaining cautious in 2013 and not exactly knowing when this protracted downtrend in heavy-duty machinery would end, I'd suggest that a high level of skepticism could be warranted, at least in the interim. Over the long run, Caterpillar is well positioned globally and has incredible pricing and brand power, which should translate into decades of growth potential, especially in emerging markets. Over the near term, though, stagnant commodity prices could put a cap on any upside in Caterpillar's share price and play right into the hands of short-sellers.

Intel

Why are investors shorting Intel?

The bet against Intel hasn't changed in more than a year now, with pessimists counting on Intel's PC processing business to slowly shrink, and for the company to have to spend heavily on research and development to play catch-up with regard to mobile processing and the cloud. The end result has been stagnant top- and bottom-line growth for Intel, which short-sellers suspect will weigh on Intel's share price.

Is this short interest warranted?

Pessimists do have a point about continued PC declines, with research firm IDC upping its estimate this past week from an expected 3.8% decline in 2014 to 6.1%. Furthermore, IDC anticipates that PC sales will decline through 2018.While that's not good news for Intel, what is good news is that it'll still be able to generate significant cash flow from its dominant position as the processing king of PCs to fund its mobile and cloud-based R&D. Intel has already shown small snippets of success in penetrating the mobile tablet market and should be a major player in cloud-based hardware by the end of the decade. I believe you'd be doing yourself a disservice by writing off Intel here.

AT&T

Why are investors shorting AT&T?

The reason short-sellers have piled into AT&T has nothing to do with poor results. It merely has to do with the risk-on investing approach we're witnessing throughout the market that has traders cycling out of traditionally defensive names like AT&T, which grows at very slow but steady rate, and instead focusing on seeking out riskier but higher-growth investments. In addition, relative to Verizon, AT&T is trailing in 4G LTE-capable cities, meaning it'll have to spend bountifully if it hopes to catch its main rival. 4G LTE is a strong lure in the U.S. to gaining new smartphone subscribers.

Is this short interest warranted?

Somehow this short trade has indeed worked for pessimists over the past year, but I doubt it'll work over the long run. Sectorwide consolidation should help tighten AT&T's costs (AT&T is purchasing Leap Wireless), and mobile devices have practically become necessity products for much of today's consumers. What this means for AT&T is steady cash flow, a healthy dividend that's currently yielding 5.8%, and few reasons to bet against the company.

Verizon

Why are investors shorting Verizon?

Although telecom giants Verizon and AT&T switched spots this month, with AT&T leapfrogging Verizon in a bad way, the story is almost exactly the same for both. Like AT&T, Verizon bears a high number of short-sellers because it's generally a slower-growth business model that simply won't be able to keep up with the double-digit growth traders are witnessing in the networking and cloud-tech space. As investors cycle out of these defensive names, they tend to slowly tick lower.

Is this short interest warranted?

Let me be clear that I don't think betting against AT&T or Verizon is a smart idea, but with the recent acquisition of its remaining unowned interest in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone, coupled with its sizable lead in rolling out 4G LTE-capable networks across the U.S., Verizon makes even less sense than AT&T to bet against. Verizon is paying out a premium 4.4% yield, and at 12 times forward earnings it looks ripe as a possible buy, if you ask me.

IBM

Why are investors shorting IBM?

Are you noticing the major tech bias on this list of the Dow's most hated companies? No. 2 through No. 5 are all tech or telecom based! IBM finds its way onto this list for many similar reasons as Intel. IBM has seen its hardware division get whacked by weakening demand, and, like Intel, has had to beef up its R&D spending to develop new cloud-based products. Pessimists believes that Big Blue may simply have fallen too far behind not to see its EPS erode in the near-term.

Is this short interest warranted?##686|you are here:##687|Empty##688|The second theory comes from Evan Soltas, Conor Sen, and others (like researchers at the New York Fed). They believe the traditional unemployment rate is in fact representative of the state of the labor market. Soltas created a scatterplot that mapped the U3 rate against the so-called “quit rate.” Many economists believe that stat, which tracks the rate at which workers quit their jobs, is a good measure of labor market slack, because workers quit their jobs more frequently when they believe they are confident in finding a new one. (Mike Konczal pushes back on this theory a bit.) Soltas found that workers are quitting their jobs as if the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent. In other words, the current U3 unemployment rate is a pretty good reflection of just how tight the job market is:





So why, then, does the prime age (aged 25-54) labor force participation rate—that is, the basic unit for measuring the size of the labor force—remain so depressed? If the labor market had really tightened up, wouldn’t discouraged, prime age workers have been drawn back into the labor force and lead the participation rate to approach its pre-crisis level? To answer that, Soltas and his allies point to the disparity between short-term unemployment, which has returned to its pre-crisis levels, and long-term unemployment, which remains elevated. The basic argument: The labor market has segmented. Effectively, workers and the short-term unemployed are acting as if the labor market has tightened significantly and the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent. But the long-term unemployed have become fully disconnected from it. They are not even competing with the short-term unemployed for work. Thus, the labor force participation rate is held down by the long-term unemployed, while the labor force itself has tightened.

These theories have important implications for Fed policy. Under the first theory, the Fed should keep its foot on the gas and keep interest rates at zero to bring discouraged workers back into the labor force. This would not lead to excessive wage growth and inflation, because, the theory goes, significant slack still exists. But under the second theory, zero interest rate policy won’t help the long-term unemployed find work since they are disconnected from the labor force. Instead, it will further drive down short-term unemployment, raise wages and create inflation. Looked at this way, it’s an not just an arcane professional debate but an argument whose outcome could shape economic policy.

Step back a bit, though, and the implications quickly look less grand. That’s because it doesn’t matter, as far as monetary policy goes, which theory is correct: No matter which point of view the Fed subscribes to, it should keep its foot on the gas.

Think again about the two theories. The Bivens/O’Brien theory, that there’s still a lot of slack in the economy, points to keeping the Fed’s foot on the gas no matter what. On the other hand, the idea that the Soltas theory must lead to ratcheting up rates is a faulty one. What if Soltas et al are correct, and the Fed decides to keep interest rates low nonetheless? The result will be stronger wage growth and moderate inflation. That’s a good thing! The Fed should keep interest rates at zero for an extended period even with the risk of moderate inflation. In fact, they should allow it to happen to ensure catch-up wage growth. (This is called overshooting and many economists, including Paul Krugman, Jared Bernstein, Dean Baker, Cardiff Garcia and Ryan Avent, have called for it.)##689|ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE, March 7 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to downplay the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

The objects are in waters north-east of Malaysia and south of Vietnam.

That would put the jet closer to its scheduled flight path than to the Malaysian military's mysterious and confusing reports of the plane possibly travelling west towards India.

Today the Chinese premier Li Keqiang publicly urged Malaysia to do more to find the plane - a further sign of Beijing's frustration over the handling of the search operation.

Peter Lloyd reports.

PETER LLOYD: It's now six days since Malaysian flight 370 went missing, en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

One hundred and fifty-three of the 239 people onboard were Chinese nationals.

Beijing has dispatched two warships and 50 other vessels to the South China Sea.

Although the Malaysian government did not formally invite them, a delegation of officials and experts from Beijing turned up in Kuala Lumpur to advise the Malaysians.

Now the Chinese are giving that advice in public.

This is the number two Chinese leader, premier Li Keqiang.

LI KEQIANG (translated): The Chinese government has asked relevant parties to enhance coordination, investigate the cause, locate the missing plane as quickly as possible and properly handle all related matters.

PETER LLOYD: All related matters may be a tilt at the public conduct of some Malaysian authorities, who've suggested that the plane was last tracked south of the Thai resort island of Phuket, at the northern entrance to the Malacca Straits.

That's more than an hour west of where it was meant to be flying.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Boeing 777 plane stayed in the air for about four hours past the time it reached its last confirmed location.

In any event the search zone is already vast, about the size of Portugal. It involves militaries and civil authorities of multiple nations including Australia.

Malaysia is in charge. But it's China that seems to be flexing its muscle.

When China's president telephoned Malaysia's prime minister to convey a sense of urgency, a Chinese official in Kuala Lumpur was made available to the media to repeat the message.

(China official speaking)

"China requests a unified channel on the Malaysian side to timely release authoritative information" said the official.

He ended his remarks by reprimanding Malaysia."The urgent task now is to speed up the search", he said.

In Beijing, the chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China had more public advice for Kuala Lumpur.

(Chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China speaking)

"In my opinion the accident is a very sad thing", he said, "and I trust the Malaysian government will give the Chinese side an explanation".

It could all be seen in the context of a legitimate expression of China's national interest. But China's a country on the up, ambitious to be a regional superpower.

The presumed location of the plane wreck lies around disputed territory in the South China Sea that Beijing claims.

It's probably no coincidence that in this crash, so much manpower and officialdom has been on such public display.

But the families of missing passengers in Beijing would expect nothing less.

MARL COLVIN: Peter Lloyd.##698|Empty##699|Empty##700|New York/San Francisco: Janet Yellen`s first policy-setting meeting as chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve will focus on how to finesse a rewriting of the central bank`s promise to keep interest rates low without roiling financial markets.

Fed policymakers will probably decide next week to scrap their threshold of a 6.5 percent unemployment rate for considering a rate rise, and instead embrace new language that is less specific about when tighter policy might come.

The threshold has been a staple of the central bank`s so-called forward guidance since December 2012, when it was first adopted to underscore a commitment to stimulus until the U.S. economy was on surer footing.

But the U.S. unemployment rate has come down with surprising speed, and now stands at 6.7 percent, leaving Fed officials anxious to adopt guidance more in keeping with their view that the economy won`t be ready for higher rates for some time to come. The trick for Yellen will be re-crafting the statement without changing expectations in markets, which currently don`t see a rate rise until midway through next year.

"This is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6.5 percent threshold because it`s not really providing any great value," William Dudley, the influential president of the New York Fed, said last week. "I`d rather do it before we reach the threshold rather than after."

Fed officials have chalked up recent signs of economic weakness to unusually severe winter weather, and they appear intent to move ahead with another $10 billion reduction in their monthly bond-buying stimulus, taking it down to $55 billion.

That leaves a revamping of the forward guidance on rates as the focal point for debate when officials gather on March 18-19.

They will issue a policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on March 19. A half hour later, Yellen, the Fed`s former vice chair, will conduct her first news conference as head of the world`s most influential central bank.

The Fed will also release updated forecasts from its 17 policymakers for economic growth, inflation and unemployment. Most importantly, officials will revise their predictions for when they will finally begin to raise rates after more than five years of holding them close to zero.

EVANS RULE

As it stands, the Fed has said it would not consider a rate rise until well after the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent, as long as inflation remains contained.

It is unclear exactly what will replace this guidance, which is the brainchild of Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, a stalwart Yellen ally who himself has acknowledged the thresholds have outlived their usefulness.

"We have had discussions on the way to formulate the next vintage of this guidance for some time," Evans said on Monday. "I can`t predict to you when we will pull the trigger."

What is clear is that the Fed will look well beyond the jobless rate in gauging the health of the labor market and deciding when to raise rates.

Yellen has emphasized the need to examine "a broad range of indicators," including the number of part-time workers who want full-time work and the percentage of long-term unemployed.

"The unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic for the state of the labor market," she told lawmakers last month.

But a clear message can be complicated to convey.

The Atlanta Fed publishes a "spider chart" plotting a range of data that, to the initiated, shows an overall improvement in labor conditions (http://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/labormarket/?d=1&s=tw)

and the New York Fed this week released its own "eight faces" of the job market graphic to track a number of key indicators (http://www.newyorkfed.org/labor-conditions/).

"The art in this is conveying information that helps people plan and financial markets align their expectations with ours," Dennis Lockhart, head of the Atlanta Fed, told Reuters last week.

Labor market gauges are not the only things the Fed will be watching in making a judgment on when to raise rates.

As the jobless rate declined close to the Fed`s threshold, the central bank began to emphasize the low level of inflation, which is running well under its 2 percent target. It could redouble that emphasis as a way to underscore its commitment to keeping rates low for some time to come.

Under Yellen`s predecessor Ben Bernanke, the Fed`s post-meeting statement swelled in verbiage as the central bank packed increasingly more information into its written communications.

Given the difficulty of laying out clear guidance, that trend may be headed for a reversal under Yellen.##701|A spokesman of Bouygues SA confirmed today that the company has increased its offer for the SFR phone unit of Vivendi SA. The cash component of the offer is said to have been raised by Bouygues SA to 11.3 billion euros (15.8 billion dollars).

The statement of Bouygues’ spokesman was cited by the Wall Street Journal: “Bouygues submitted its reviewed offer to Vivendi Wednesday.” He, however, refused to disclose any more details about the improved bid but explained that the company “will communicate financial details to the market before it opens”.

An eventual merger between Vivendi’s SFR unit and Bouygues is said to create a mobile carrier that owns over 21 million subscribers, reducing the number of network operators from four to three.

Bouygues SA shared in a statement that it has increased the cash component of its proposal to Vivendi SA by 800 million euros. After the acquisition of SFR by Bouygues, 43% of the new entity will be held by Vivendi SA in comparison to the previous offer of Bouygues. The company is expected to get a 52% majority stake after the merger.

The company also said in its statement, which was cited by Bloomberg: “An IPO of the new entity is planned as soon as the merger is completed, offering Vivendi an immediate opportunity to monetize its interest. Bouygues is committed to facilitate the liquidity of Vivendi’s interest in the new entity.”

Altice SA, Bouygues SA’s main competitor, is said to have made an offer amounting to 10.9 billion euros in cash and assets, which together would estimate Vivendi’s SFR unit at about 20 billion dollars. One of the company’s spokesmen revealed on Wednesday that Altice’s offer was unchanged.

Vivendi SA refused to make any comments on the situation on Wednesday.

Bouygues SA fell by 0.19% in Paris by 9:37 GMT to trade at 31.96 euros per share, marking a one-year change of +43.41%. The company is valued at 10.23 billion euros. According to the Financial Times, the 13 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Bouygues SA have a median target of 29.00 euros, with a high estimate of 35.00 euros and a low estimate of 21.00 euros. The median estimate represents a -9.45% decrease from the previous close of 32.03 euros.##702|LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.

European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption. With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis.

"Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance," he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday. "So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices."

European consumers get about a quarter of their gas needs met by Russia. Most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine.

Davey said there was an increase in oil and gas prices on the international market in response to the row, which erupted in November when ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade deal with the European Union.

"They've now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices," he said.##703|Miss Chiquita is getting hitched to an Irishman. The 144-year-old banana company is set to merge with its European rival, Fyffes, in a deal that would create the world’s biggest banana supplier.

Charlotte, North Carolina-based fruit company Chaiquita Brands announced Monday it is merging with Ireland-based Fyffes in an all-stock deal valued at $1.1 billion, Reuters reports.

The new company, which will be named ChiquitaFyffes, will control nearly 14% of the banana supplier market well ahead of Fresh Del Monte and Dole Food Company.

“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,” Ed Lonergan, Chaquita chief executive says.

Officials with the new company say the merger will bring new opportunities to the industry.

ChiquitaFyffes is estimated to have $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas.

With approximately 32,000 employees, the new company will be based in Ireland where it will receive operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016.

The merger will be subject to review by competition authorities, but company officials say it is unlikely to face opposition as the two companies operate in different markets.

Chiquita and Fyffes merge to make world’s biggest banana firm [Reuters]##704|Empty##705|Colorado raked in about $2 million from taxes on recreational marijuana in January, the first month it was legal to sell non-medicinal pot in the state.

State officials say the numbers came in as expected.

On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational marijuana to anyone age 21 or older. Cannabis purchases are limited to one ounce. It's the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale.

Colorado places a 15% excise tax, a 10% special sales tax and a 2.9% sales tax on recreational marijuana, in addition to application and license fees. It imposes just a 2.9% sales tax, as well as application on license fees, on medical marijuana, which was legalized by voters in Colorado in 2000.

When combined with taxes and fees from medicinal marijuana, the state brought in a total of $3.5 million in January from pot sales.

The state also taxes alcohol, which brought in about $5.1 million in taxes in December, the most recent data available from the Colorado Department of Revenue.

A big chunk of the funds collected from marijuana taxes will be funneled to programs aimed at keeping kids way from pot. The governor has requested funds for the prevention of youth marijuana, for treatment of substance use, regulatory oversight, and law enforcement and public safety.##706|Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the combined company, ChiquitaFyffes, while Fyffes shareholders will have the remaining 49.3 percent, the companies said in a statement on Monday.

The New York-listed combined company will have tax savings from being domiciled in Ireland, similar to U.S. drugmaker Perrigo's acquisition of Elan last year.

Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38 percent over its Friday's closing price.

Fyffes shares jumped 29 percent to 1.15 euros by 0710 GMT.

The deal could raise antitrust issues, given that more than 80 percent of the global banana market is controlled by four multinationals - Chiquita, Fyffes, Fresh Del Monte and Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company - according to the United Nations.

SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Alibaba's eye-popping IPO plans in the U.S. just sent ripples from Hong Kong to New York to Sunnyvale, Calif.

MORE: Eye-popping gains by IPOs are back

The decision by the Chinese e-commerce leviathan -- whose online properties handle more goods than eBay and Amazon.com combined -- to hold its long-awaited public offering in the USA is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company's preferred venue.

But it is a boon to two of Alibaba's largest shareholders: Yahoo, which owns 24%, and Japan's Softbank, which controls 37%.

Alibaba's success has essentially propped up the Silicon Valley Internet giant's shares hugely, even as its core business has languished. Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimated in a recent research note that Alibaba alone is worth $21 of Yahoo's stock price, which closed at $37.60 on Friday.

Alibaba Group doesn't report its finances. But Yahoo, which initially invested in it in 2005, said Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ending in September rose 51% from a year earlier to $1.8 billion.

(That's down from 61% growth over a year earlier in the previous quarter and 71% in the first quarter of 2013.)

While the Hong Kong market mourns its lost golden goose, U.S. investors have billions of dollar signs dancing in their heads and calculators.

Alibaba, which controls about 80% of China's e-commerce, is sure to add sizzle to the New York financial scene: Its public offering could be one of the biggest ever in the U.S. Some estimates peg its valuation at $130 billion.

Wall Street eased modestly, as investors had their first chance to react to soft data out of China over the weekend.

The Dow Jones lost 0.2 per cent to close at 16,419.

The S&P 500 was also down, but a mere 1 point to 1,877, while the Nasdaq was off 2 points to 4,334.

An unexpectedly sharp 18 per cent pull-back in China's exports fuelled concern on Wall Street that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The data set off an sharp 8.3 per cent slide in the iron ore price, its biggest one-day price fall in more than four years.

Iron ore was worth $US104.70 at Tianjin in China, which is its lowest price since October 2012, and Chinese steel futures dropped to record lows.

John Noonan, Head of IFR Forexwatch Asia for Thomson Reuters, says China's latest import and export data is largely to blame.

"The main factor is expectations that last month's slump in iron ore imports by China will continue due to the weakening yuan and huge stockpiles at China ports," he said.

Back in the US, and shares in Boeing, manufacturer of the Malaysia Airline's plane that is missing presumed crashed, dropped 2 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.

The sharp fall in metal prices weighed on mining stocks on London's FTSE 100, which is heavy on resources stocks, and it closed down 0.4 per cent to 6,689.

Shares in Rio Tinto lost 1.9 per cent, after having fallen much more steeply yesterday in Australia.

Markets were mixed in Europe, with France's CAC rising 0.1 per cent, but Germany's DAX losing 0.9 per cent.

The Australian share market was set for a flat start to trade - the ASX SPI 200 was up 1 point at 5,421.

The Australian dollar was buying 90.19 US cents.

On commodity markets, the spot gold price was slightly lower at $US1,339.91 an ounce.

Oil continues to see steady trade, with West Texas crude barely changed from Friday at $US101.34 a barrel, and Singapore's Tapis crude priced at $US114.56.

March 12 (Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd said on Wednesday that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company’s share price down more than 16 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife’s distribution model, which he calls a “pyramid scheme,” where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife said it “will cooperate fully with the FTC.”

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,” the company said in a statement. “We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

So far, Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, has lost money on his short bet as rivals such as businessman Carl Icahn took the other side.

Herbalife’s share price fell 16.4 percent on news of the FTC inquiry but later recovered to close at $60.57, down about 7.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.

Los Angeles-based Herbalife this week blasted Ackman for carrying out “an unfounded, relentless and fraudulent public attack on Herbalife’s business model.”

“There has never been merit to his accusations,” the company said in a statement on March 10.

News of the FTC investigation came one day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China.

Ackman’s $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has been shorting the stock since the middle of 2012.

The FTC has a broad reach to investigate companies which are deceptive. But it does no criminal prosecution and usually is limited to recovering money lost by affected consumers.

Its biggest recent probe was of Google, which rivals had accused of skewing search results so companies competing with Google appeared lower than appropriate. The FTC decided after an extended probe that Google broke no antitrust law in search.

The FTC issued a statement acknowledging an investigation into Herbalife but declined to discuss it. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.##711|Transcript for GM Ignition Switch Investigation

Malaysian authorities expanded the search area for Flight 370 to the Straight of Malacca, one of the “most heavily traveled waterways in the entire world,” a U.S. Navy 7th Fleet spokesman said yesterday.

—

At least 250 tons of evidence from Malasyia Flight 370 should be out there somewhere. Two hundred and 39 people, parts of the plane, suitcases, seat cushions that are supposed to float — it just seems that something, even the smallest shred of evidence, must be out there waiting to be spotted.

At least, that’s the thinking behind the DigitalGlobe effort; the aerial imaging company has fixed their orbiting satellite cameras on the Gulf of Thailand and surrounding regions where the missing Boeing 777 was last tracked.

The Colorado-based company says crowdsourcing the search is the best solution to finding clues. By making their high-resolution images available to the public, potentially hundreds of thousands of eyes can inspect the search areas and help to look for yet-unspotted traces of the flight.

“For people who aren’t able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean to get to the Malaysian peninsula, or who can’t fly airplanes to look there, this is a way that they can contribute and try to help out,” Luke Barrington, senior manager of Geospatial Big Data for DigitalGlobe, told ABC News.

The images being gathered will be made available for free to the public on a website called Tomnod. Anyone can click on the link and begin searching the images, tagging anything that looks suspicious. Each pixel on a computer screen represents half a meter on the ocean’s surface, Barrington said.

According to ABC, DigitalGlobe will use a computer algorithm to determine whether users start tagging certain regions more than others. In-house satellite imaging experts will follow up on leads, Barrington said.

“We’ll say, ‘Here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations,’” Barrington said. “Is it really an aircraft wing that’s been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I’d start.”

DigitalGlobe has used this technique to assess damage after other natural or manmade disasters, including the tornado that leveled the Plaza Elementary School in Moore, Okla., and the devastating damage to Seaside Heights, N.J. after Superstorm Sandy.

“In many cases the areas are so large or the things are are looking for are so hard to find that without the help of hundreds of thousands of people online we’d never be able to find them,” Barrington said.

1. Chinese exports surprisingly drop

Ordering extra General Tso's chicken doesn't help China's export data. According to Beijing's customs department, shipments of Chinese goods shockingly dropped 18.1% from a year ago, while Wall Street had been expecting a 5% increase. Even more shockingly, China actually imported more than it exported, creating the first significant monthly trade deficit since early 2012. The decline in January/February exports was the worst two-month stretch east of the Great Wall since '09.

Is this good or bad for the United States? The fact that exports dropped could be a bad sign for the global economy, indicating general shrinking demand. Imports boosted, though, so investors' silver lining was that China could be a solid market for sales of "Made in USA" goods.

It turns out there was something funky in the numbers (and it wasn't MSG). First, China's epic Lunar Holiday lasted a week in February. Plus, reports surfaced earlier this year that much of last year's data had included inflated numbers as Chinese officials tried to boost the country's economic appearance following investor worries that its growth was slowing more than expected.

The takeaway is that unlike free-market economies, China's "People's" government has some serious control of their economy's movement -- at last week's meeting, the National People's Congress set a target of 7.5% GDP growth for this year. Interestingly, Beijing also reported that imports rose by 10.1%, indicating the baby steps of the country's transition from megaproducer-of-the-world to a more consumer-based economy.

2. Chiquita Bananas announces acquisition of rival Fyffes

Donkey and Diddy Kong are anxious about the proposed acquisition of Ireland's Fyffes by America's own Chiquita (UNKNOWN:CQB.DL). An agreement was reached Monday to create "ChiquitaFyffes" (their PR teams are not very creative), the new biggest fruit supplier in the world.



The cost of Fyffes is 379 million euros, but it won't cost Chiquita a cent. That's because the company is issuing regular stock to Fyffes shareholders instead of money. The all-stock offer by Chiquita will deliver 15.6% of a Chiquita share for every one share of Fyffes. At Chiquita's stock price before the deal was announced, that values Fyffes shares at 36% more than Friday's stock price (hence the 46% rise in Fyffe stock today -- the extra 11% of valuation shows that investors actually went bananas after this deal announcement).



Chiquita stock also rose 10.7% Monday as investors figured this new company can eliminate redundant costs of the combined company, strengthen purchasing power, and flex their size to bring in more profits (in finance speak, 1+1 = more than 2).



Did we say that Chiquita is based in America? Its offices and shares are based in North Carolina and New York, respectively. But it's legally registered in Ireland as well (the Shamrock nation is known for beer and low taxes), which means the acquisition is pending approval by the Irish High Court.

3. Airlines stocks suffer (not because of Malaysia Airlines crash)

While the Malaysia Airlines disappearance mystery continues to baffle (and our thoughts go out to all those affected), American Airlines slipped 0.2%, while JetBlue and Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell more than 1% Monday for other notable reasons.

Your favorite DirecTV-equipped airline, JetBlue, announced that it's ending an agreement that allowed passengers to add American Airlines connections to JetBlue itineraries. This is just a week after Delta decided to change its frequent flyer program from miles- to spending-based. Apparently airlines can ruin your day even if you're not stuck in a middle seat.

Things were a tad more complicated for Boeing. While the missing Malaysia Flight 370 was a Boeing 777, that model is used throughout the industry and boasts one heckuva safety record. What worried investors Monday was fresh news that 40 of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner planes that are still in production had experienced hairline cracks during flight tests.

The back-and-forth jostling between Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank that first came to light in October has finally come to a close: Men’s Wearhouse said it will buy Jos. A. Bank for $65 a share in cash, or a total of $1.8 billion.

The final purchase price is up from the most recent $63.50 bid Jos. A. Bank had rejected in late February and also marked a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank’s closing price on Oct. 8, a day before it announced its attempt to buy its larger rival that set off a soap-opera-like quid pro quo.

Bloomberg

Men’s Wearhouse, founded in 1973, rose 4.5%. Jos. A. Bank, started in 1905, climbed 3.8%.

The transaction will create the fourth-largest men’s clothing retailer in the U.S., after Macy’s /quotes/zigman/467976/delayed /quotes/nls/m M , Kohl’s /quotes/zigman/231595/delayed /quotes/nls/kss KSS , and J.C. Penney /quotes/zigman/237947/delayed /quotes/nls/jcp JCP , Men’s Wearhouse said. It will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., about 23,000 employees and combined sales of $3.5 billion before any consolidation, the company said. Men’s Wearhouse said getting rid of duplicate corporate functions, consolidating merchandising buying and other purchases will help lead to annual cost savings of as much as $150 million. Jos. A. Bank banner will remain in place. Men’s Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert is expected to lead the combined company, a person familiar with the situation said.

In a prior presentation with investors, Men’s Wearhouse, with $2.5 billion in sales and 1,140 stores, said it targets 25-55 year olds who are “style conscious and contemporary.’ That compares with Jos. A. Bank’s 35-55-year old customers who are after styles that are more “traditional and conservative.” Men’s Wearhouse’s target customer is less affluent with annual household income of $75,000 versus Jos. A. Bank’s $100,000 to $125,000 household income.

Men’s Wearhouse, with a loyalty program, also is expected to create a customer reward program under the Jos. A. Bank banner.

“There are a ton of potential synergies, not least of which include rationalizing stores 2-3 blocks apart,” said Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson. “This can be a real win-win for both firms.”

The company said management will consist of the “most qualified individuals.” Men’s Wearhouse said it has a “proven track record” of acquisitions, having integrated about 600 stores and over 7,000 employees in its prior purchases of Joseph Abboud, After Hours and Moores. The company said its purchase is not conditioned on any financing and said it expects to fund the purchase, expected to close by the third quarter, with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and committed debt financing from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan.

The Libyan government said late Monday the Morning Glory, which is carrying a cargo of Es Sider crude loaded by rebels who are in control of the port in eastern Libya, had come under the navy's control.

At a late press conference in Tripoli, Libya's culture minister Amin al-Habib said the vessel was being escorted to a western port and was set to arrive "within hours."

However, early Tuesday, French news agency AFP quoted a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority, as saying the vessel had slipped its escort.



"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," the lawmaker said, according to AFP.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape, and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

Platts was unable to confirm the status of the Morning Glory early Tuesday.

The North Korea-flagged vessel on Monday completed loading a cargo of up to 350,000 barrels of Es Sider crude, but the Libyan navy surrounded the tanker before bringing it under its control.

Tripoli had also threatened to bomb the tanker if it set sail.

The government and state-owned oil company NOC have stressed that rebels in eastern Libya have no legal right to sell oil.

Tripoli has also formed a new armed force that will be charged with liberating three eastern Libyan ports -- Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Marsa al-Hariga -- that have been occupied by rebels since July last year.

As a reminder for readers, the last change in the band parameters had taken effect back in 2007 and 2012. Today, i won’t be too long before FX traders have CNY on their screens.

—By CNBC##734|A federal prosecutor has kicked off a criminal investigation into General Motors over the company’s seeming foot-dragging on a recall of vehicles with faults that led to the death of at least 13.

The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, CNN Money reported, citing similar stories in Bloomberg, Reuters and The New York Times.

The U.S. attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny the investigation, CNN Money reported. A spokesman for the office said the official normally declined to speak publicly about any investigation that was in the early stages.

GM spokesman Alan Adler said the comment would not comment.

The company faces fire for its slow recall of several models — from the Chevrolet Cobalt to the Saturn Ion — that had ignition switch issues. GM knew of the problems a decade ago, but only issued the recall, which involved ultimately 1.4 million vehicles, in February. Federal law mandates that companies must notify customers of failures and recall alerts within five days of finding the mechanical failure.

At least 13 people reportedly died in traffic mishaps related to the ignition with issue, CNN Money reported.

China has attached high attention on Government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Li told his annual press conference at the end of the parliament session.

Citing an official audit of Government debts last year, Li said the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the internationally recognised warning limit.

After two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that Governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of ¥20.7 trillion ($3.4 trillion) at the end of June last year, up 8.6 per cent, or ¥1.63 trillion, since the end of 2012.

China’s mounting Government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability, and China has started to take steps to address the issue.

Li said while the level is within control, he cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.

In China, local Governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own.

The fiscal funds they receive from the central Government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local Government financing vehicles.

“We will keep the front open and block side doors,” Li stressed at the media conference.

Li also said that authorities have set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.

Regarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.

He said the Government would also continue with the nationwide crackdown on corruption.

“China is a country under rule of law. No matter who he is, and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country, he will be punished to the full extent, because everybody is equal before the law”.

“Corruption is a natural enemy of the people’s Government,” Li said adding, “We must put the exercise of power and the use of public money under institutional checks”.

Li said the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Government are firm in will and determination to fight corruption, and “that is our consistent position”.

The Government will step up its efforts for the release of “a list of powers” and define a clear boundary for the exercise of power to ensure that it is not abused, he said.

The Government will also carry out comprehensive audit in those areas which are of high concern to the public, such as the revenues on the transfer of land use rights and transfer of mining rights, according to Li.

“We will take institutional steps to ensure corruption will have nowhere to hide,” he said.##740|Empty##741|U.S. consumers began this month feeling more worried about their economic future, according to one survey of households released Friday.

The state Department of Revenue released the figures on Monday, which showed how much Colorado has taken in from both medical and recreational marijuana taxes and fees.

The medical marijuana sales for January generated an additional $900,000 in sales tax, for a total tax revenue of $2.9 million for both sides of the state's marijuana dispensary market. Including fees, the figure jumps to $3.5 million.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," Barbara Brohl, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts."

The figures represent the tax returns from 59 businesses around Colorado, according to the department.

The recreational marijuana tax numbers come from two levies that state voters approved last November -- a 10 percent special sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year -- about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

The first week of sales was robust in the state. With only 37 dispensaries open at the time, they collectively brought in roughly $5 million in total sales.

Although the initial crush of retail pot sales has tapered off since January, sales and tax figures are expected to remain steady with more than 150 recreational marijuana dispensaries now licensed, and more added to that list every month.##746|Empty##747|Peter Parks/AFP/GettyImages

China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group confirmed early Sunday that it plans to become a public company in the US.

Rumored to be near for months, a US IPO would "make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency," the company said in a brief note on its Web site. The statement did not indicate which stock exchange the company would choose for its listing.

Alibaba, which controls nearly 80 percent of China's Internet shopping market, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, giving it a $130 billion valuation. That lofty target would challenge Facebook's record Internet IPO, which raised $16 billion in 2012.

Founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma, the company provides marketplace platforms that allow merchants to sell goods directly to consumers. Rather than selling goods to consumers as US e-commerce giant Amazon does, Alibaba provides listing and advertising services.

The statement appears to snub the Hong Kong stock exchange, which had been competing for the offering with US stock exchanges but objected to some of Alibaba's proposed listing terms. The company said it was keeping its options open for a possible dual listing in China.

"We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group," Alibaba said in Sunday's statement. "We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong."

The IPO is also expected to a boon for Yahoo, which still owns 24 percent of the China e-commerce giant.##748|A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were shadowing it yesterday, members of Tripoli's parliament said.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the parliament's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

A second member of the parliament confirmed the vessel's escape. The official Lana news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the vessel, the Morning Glory, had slipped away. A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape.

Libyan authorities said on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for former rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil. The Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, was the first to do so.

The stand-off at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels a day to just 250,000.

The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the Opec member country may slide deeper into chaos.##749|Posted Monday, March 17, 2014 5:01 am

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - The search for the missing Malaysian jet pushed deep into the northern and southern hemispheres Monday as Australia took the lead in scouring the seas of the southern Indian Ocean and Kazakhstan - about 10,000 miles to the northwest - answered Malaysia's call for help in the unprecedented hunt.

French investigators arriving to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals - but investigators say the Malaysian airliner's communications links were deliberately severed ahead of its mysterious disappearance more than a week ago.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.

Malaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots' home on March 9, the day after the flight.

Investigators haven't ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight's last words - "All right, good night" - to ground controllers.

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots - or someone else - without the other pilot's knowledge.

Malaysia's government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

Over the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 ½ hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.

The northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan - all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.

An official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to questions on radar information.

Indonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country's search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the "ill-fated aircraft" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia's leader.

"Australia will do its duty in this matter," Abbott told parliament. "We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."

Australia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.##750|CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Gold for April delivery surrendered 1 percent to close at $1,338.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

For the week, prices held onto a gain of around 1.3 percent, based on the most-active contracts, according to FactSet data.

The U.S. added 175,000 jobs in February, surpassing the 140,000 positions expected by MarketWatch. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent, edging up because more people entered the labor force in search of jobs but not all of them found one.

In other metals, May silver slumped 3 percent to end at $20.93 an ounce. Prices have lost about 1.5 percent week to date.

High-grade copper for May delivery gave up 4.2 percent to $3.08 a pound, down 3.3 percent from the week-ago close.

April platinum lost 0.2 percent to $1,483.60 an ounce, ending around 2.5 percent higher for the week, while March palladium rose 0.1 percent to $781.80 an ounce, up roughly 5 percent for the week.

In energy, oil futures closed higher today, fueled by better-than-expected monthly data on nonfarm payrolls.

Following seven-consecutive weeks of gains, however, prices finished the week roughly unchanged as concerns over the situation in Ukraine calmed.

April oil gained 1 percent to finish at $102.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices settled at $102.59 last Friday.##758|“If you invested all of your money in virtual currency, don’t be surprised when it virtually disappears. Who could have predicted this? Virtually everyone. Yes, the internet’s biggest Bitcoin exchange collapsed after hackers stole all the Bitcoins. Oh no! And I was saving for a unicorn! You know, I’m no fan of Citibank but I trust it more than three guys in a basement playing Dungeons and Dragons.”

"...{We have created a system for} digital currency processing. In example embodiments, the transaction request indicating an amount in a first currency and a desired second currency is received by the currency module. A non-exhaustive and example list of currencies capable of being exchanged may include frequent flyer miles, loyalty and reward points (e.g., credit card reward points, hotel loyalty points, retail loyalty points), virtual currency, cash, Bitcoins, Facebook credits, eBay bucks, cash-equivalent currency (e.g., gift cards, travelers checks, cashier's checks), and any other form of currency…"

The problem, to be clear, has to do with the fact that online digital currency exchanges are terribly insecure, entirely unregulated and completely uninsured. The result is that the collapse of and theft at Mt.Gox , the hacking of Flexcoin , and the breach at Poloniex have all served to damage Bitcoin’s young reputation. This for no good reason – Bitcoin is not in any way to fault for the recent problems. But you wouldn’t know it by listening to some popular voices; most are all too happy (and quick) to dump on Bitcoin. For example, Bill Maher.During the New Rules segment of the most recent Real Time with Bill Maher, Maher said:Actually, Bill, they were playing Magic: The Gathering … Okay? Alright, that’s neither here nor there…On the ultra-libertarian website “The Prudent Bear”, writer Martin Hutchinson gleefully wrote , “Bad luck Millennials. Your new and clever scheme to replicate the old-fashioned virtues of gold in the cybersphere appears to have fallen apart.”Wrong, both of you! Wrong, wrong, wrong!This is part of a larger narrative, one that hides in the statistics of Bitcoin and other digital currencies; the people who use them are really young ! Hell, more than 90% of Bitcoiners are male and between 20-30 years old. As a result, this means that just about every person in mainstream media and economics – who have an average age of, what, roughly 3000 – have no bloody clue about Bitcoin.In the end we’re left with half-baked thoughts on the subject, like Maher’s… I mean, to Bill Maher: you trusted Lehman Brothers not too long ago… How did that work out for you? Was Mr. Fuld more trustworthy than three kids in a basement, or less?And given that Bill’s real money really disappeared with no real charges against real people, I wonder if he – like those who lost their Bitcoin on Mt. Gox – feels like a real idiot?I'm off-track again...To move in the right direction, it’s important to first understand that Bitcoin is not to blame for the recent screw-ups at Mt. Gox, Poloniex, and Flexcoin; and in order to do that it only makes sense to understand why and how Bitcoin works.So let’s have at it – why and how does Bitcoin work? And what makes it so special?The most direct answers come from the initial information paper on Bitcoin which was authored by the currency’s enigmatic inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, the paper asserts a desire to eliminate large financial institutions from internet commerce.In essence, Nakamoto views the use of third party institutions as an unnecessary expense in the age of online business. To this point Nakamoto writes, “The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions.”Bitcoin, then, was to serve as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”And hell, the system has worked amazingly well in this capacity. While it’s easy to point to the Colossus-level disaster at Mt. Gox, Bitcoin’s impact on global remittance (i.e. when someone who is working abroad sends money home) has been astonishing. Did you know that global remittance totalled between $400-520 billion USD in 2012, that most major financial institutions charge between 9-20% for money transfers, or that most Bitcoin transfer services charge 3%, or a flat rate (typically $3 USD or so) for the same service?But this still doesn’t fully explain how Bitcoin works. Sure, we’ve scratched the surface of why it’s useful, but how does it work?Articles abound, I would suggest starting with the most basic primer, available on Bitcoin.org , or if you’re willing to read a somewhat long, slightly biased explanation of Bitcoin, check out the article on HowStuffWorks.com . What every article is essentially explaining though is that the Peer-to-Peer structure of Bitcoin (and, in theory, digital currencies using similar code,) solves what is called the Byzantine Generals’ Problem (also called the Two Generals’ Problem or Byzantine fault tolerance).By allowing computers all over the world to assist in providing hashes (essentially transactions stamps) which are then sent to what is called the block-chain (a massive public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions), the decentralized system works to ensure that each transaction between a Bitcoin holder and Bitcoin recipient is unique. As well, the nature of the relationship between the Peer-to-Peer network which is providing hashes to the block-chain is such that the ability for hackers to every disrupt the network grows more difficult as time passes.In short, Bitcoin – through the use of cryptographic stamps, provided by a decentralized peer-to-peer based network – successfully solves the Byzantine Generals’ Problem thus creating an entirely decentralized and secure network for direct business-to-consumer interactions; in theory this serves to eliminate the need for financial institutions that act as third-party operators in online commerce.What Bitcoin doesn’t do, though, is address the issues that arise when tens, hundreds, or thousands of digital currencies are on the market and people want to trade those digital currencies for other digital currencies, or for fiat currencies... And that makes a hell of a lot of sense. Bitcoin is Bitcoin; it is not every coin… To say it again, Bitcoin eliminates the need for trusted third-party institutions as far as a transaction that deal exclusively with Bitcoin.For example, if a person mines Dogecoin, then wants to trade it in for Bitcoin, then trade the Bitcoin for Mooncoin, then to Litecoin, then back to Bitcoin, they're going to need third-party operator to help out.Enter online exchanges.Unlike Bitcoin, online exchanges are not decentralized; just the opposite. Online exchanges have physical and permanent addresses, physical and accessible servers, employees who maintain the security of those servers, profits and expenditures. Unlike a Bitcoin wallet that is hosted on a laptop or USB stick – to which only the user has access ( decent security measures assumed ) – a wallet on an online exchange is, fundamentally, in the possession of the online exchange, and accessible to people with admin privileges or the technical capacity to breach them.So what has happened at these fast-falling exchanges? Well, no one really knows. The best explanations available explain what clearly did not happen. If anything, the conclusion that Bill Maher came to may be closest to correct: The people running these exchanges can be shadier than Slim The best read I’ve found on the subject, “ What Did Not Happen at Mt. Gox ” by hacker and Cornell Professor Emin Gün Sirer, came to this fantastic conclusion; “What Nigerian scams are to your grandfather, Bitcoin exchanges are to the 20-30 semi-tech-savvy libertarian demographic.”In other words, it’s incredibly easy to be taken for a ride by the ‘Nigerian princes’ that run these exchanges. The theft at Flexcoin, wherein $600,000 US went missing, saw the funds transfer to just two Bitcoin wallets. At Poloniex, 12.3% of Bitcoins were stolen overnight. A few people are suggesting that the breach at Mt. Gox could have been an However, if legitimate online exchanges are able to codify a clear system by which they can assure security (or better yet, insure), this problem, like the Byzantine Generals before it, will fall.And it looks like eBay is about to tackle the issue.As reported on eCommerceBytes.com , eBay has filed an application that seems to hint they may be getting into the online exchange business. To quote from the patent application Wouldn't that be interesting to see? My bet is that if a mega-firm like eBay launches an online exchange and markets it well, a horde of new and eager digital currency users will quickly get involved. And that bodes very well for Bitcoin, along with the countless other digital currencies out there. More legitimacy, more publicity (of the positive sort), and more opportunities to use digital currencies will all serve to increase their value.Of course, it's worth noting safe exchanges already exist provided that you use them properly. A great first step in ensuring safety is to remember that online exchanges are not banks. It's silly and dangerous to think of them as anything other than places to make quick trades; a place where you can take your privately stored currency, trade it for another, and then return your new currency back to a private, backed-up, offline wallet.After what has been a rough few months for Bitcoin, it's great to see that there might be huge and positive advances with regard to online exchanges in the near future; eBay or otherwise, digital currencies need better, trustworthy exchanges in order for current and future users to better trust the currencies themselves.##759|By Michael Shields

VIENNA (Reuters) - The Council of Europe, the pan-European human rights watchdog, is offering to investigate violence and the treatment of minorities in Ukraine to try to defuse mounting tensions between Kiev and Russia, Austria said.

Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister of Austria, which holds the revolving chair of the 47-member Council until May, told Reuters on Friday that he and the Council's secretary general would visit Kiev on Monday to offer its services in the conflict.

Moscow has cited the need to protect the rights of the ethnic Russian minority in Ukraine as the official reason for its military intervention that has put pro-Russia forces in control of the Crimea region, where ethnic Russians are in the majority.

President Vladimir Putin underscored that on Friday, rebuffing a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over Moscow's intervention and saying that Russia could not ignore calls for help from Russian speakers in Ukraine.

"We know the ethnic Russians in Crimea are anything but a minority but nevertheless for peaceful co-existence in Crimea it is decisive how people treat each other in Ukraine, how human rights are respected and how minorities are protected and supported," Kurz said.

Both Russia and Ukraine are members of the Council of Europe, which Kurz said had credibility and expertise in supporting minority rights. He called the Ukrainian parliament's repeal of a law making Russia a recognized language in some regions "an absolute mistake".

The Council of Europe is best known for drawing up the European Convention on Human Rights, which entered into force in 1953 and established the European Court of Human Rights.

Asked how Russia had reacted so far to the mediation offer, Kurz said: "At least there have been no negative voices in the Council of Europe from the Russian side."

The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is also trying to mediate in Ukraine.

However, dozens of military observers from OSCE members invited by Ukraine to monitor the situation in Crimea had to turn back on Thursday after failing to get past roadblocks.

The OSCE, a pan-European forum for security issues that was set up during the Cold War, is also trying to put together a "contact group" of leading players in the Ukraine crisis and to arrange a broader monitoring mission for Ukraine.

OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities Astrid Thors expressed alarm on Thursday about the situation in Crimea, citing "a real risk of bloodshed".

During her visit to Kiev and Crimea, she "found no evidence of violations or threats to the rights of Russian speakers", her office said in a statement.

(Editing by Susan Fenton)##760|Last week, at her ceremonial swearing in at the imposing atrium of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., Janet Yellen gave a remarkable speech. Short -- less than three pages double-spaced -- it nevertheless conveyed what Chair Yellen brings to the table.

Her remarks began with a few standard points about the mission of the Federal Reserve. In speaking of her own and the Fed's mission, she promised "to help restore the health of the economy and promote a strong and stable financial system." She noted that substantial progress had been made in the past several years, but that much remained to be done to achieve the twin goals of the Federal Reserve -- full employment and stable prices. She noted that "the economy continues to operate considerably short of these objectives."

She moved on to mention the steps the Board has taken to strengthen financial regulation and the steps it will take to implement the Dodd-Frank Act. She promised to continue former Chairman Bernanke's movement toward making the Federal Reserve more transparent and accountable through further improving communication with the public. These remarks echo those by Bernanke in 2010, when he emphasized the need for stronger regulation of the banking system to prevent another crisis and the role of improved communication with the public in restoring the public's faith in the banking system.

But there were also several parts of the speech that revealed something about where her passions lie, and how the Yellen era at the Fed is likely to differ from previous tenures.

Chair Yellen described the oath of office that she had just taken as "a public promise to carry out [her] duties guided by no interest other than the public interest."

Then, she devoted the second-longest paragraph in her speech to extolling the skills and dedication of the "men and women" on the Fed's staff, emphasizing their integrity, tireless work, creativity and perseverance.

Finally, in the climax of her speech she brought home the importance of the Fed's work to the average American, closing with this promise and an evocative description of what achieving that promise means to an unemployed worker:

I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy. The unemployment rate represents millions of individuals who are eager to work but struggling to provide for themselves and their families. When we make progress toward our goals, each job that is created lifts this burden for someone who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.

For me, an economist who has dedicated my life to advancing the status of women, experiencing first-hand Janet Yellen's elevation to this leadership position -- making her arguably the most powerful woman in the world -- was deeply moving.##761|American and JetBlue End Interline Agreement

The American Airlines and US Airways merger has given the new American Airlines more robust service offerings in the northeastern U.S., the newly combined airline said.

As such, American Airlines announced today that it will terminate its interline traffic agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program with JetBlue Airways.

That agreement covered select routes from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).

Beginning today, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier, the American press release said.

In addition, effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline.

All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers' accounts and are not affected, said American.

American also said the two airlines are working together to ensure these changes have little impact to customers.

What do you think of this $type?##762|Empty##763|The latest budget from President Obama and the White House has 1,438 pages in the appendix alone, but there is one stunning number about Fannie Mae (NASDAQOTH:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (NASDAQOTH:FMCC) that will either devastate or delight investors.

Staggering profitability

The White House projects Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make $179.2 billion through the end of the 2024 fiscal year. By the end of March this year, the two government sponsored entities will have already delivered $203 billion in dividends back to the Federal government, fully eclipsing the original $187.5 billion investment the U.S. Treasury made during the financial crisis. Many questioned the viability of Fannie and Freddie in the midst of the financial crisis, but the two have rebounded to remarkable profitability.

Even more staggering than the total of profit is the jump of those projections over the last year alone. The budget proposed last year by the White House noted it only anticipated Fannie and Freddie delivering $51 billion back to the Treasury by 2023.

Such increases in the projections clearly highlights the turnaround the two entities have had over the last year as a result of the improved housing market. It also provides evidence why there's been so much noise from billionaire investors Bruce Berkowitz and Bill Ackman -- who have disclosed positions in the companies.

It would be easy to think this a reason for investors to pour more money in the stocks, however the budget also came with a powerful reminder.

Sobering reality

The exact language the government uses notes:

The cumulative budgetary impact of the [senior preferred stock agreements (PSPA)] from the first PSPA purchase through [fiscal year] 2024 is estimated to be a net return to taxpayers of $179.2 billion.

Note the critical distinction surrounding the net return found in the guidance provided by the White House: "to taxpayers." It provides a stark reminder Fannie and Freddie have no commitments to their investors apart from the U.S. Treasury and taxpayers in the United States.

The mission of Fannie and Freddie is stated plainly as they aim to, "provide liquidity and stability to the secondary mortgage market and to promote affordable housing." It's a reminder they are in no way intended to generate returns to shareholders in the current state.

The latest annual report from Fannie Mae notes it is "no longer managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns." It also notes "the conservatorship and investment by Treasury have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our common and preferred shareholders."

Ultimately, the thought of nearly $180 billion in profit over the next ten years is eye-popping to investors. However, unless the government does a 180° and releases these companies back to private investors, the only way to see a dime of it would be through the benefit realized as taxpayers, not investors.##764|In the past 18 months, TriMet bus drivers have been on the receiving end of some brutal attacks, including three stabbings and a vicious beating at a North Portland stop last fall.

On that, the driver’s union and management at Oregon’s largest transit agency agree.

But Amalgamated Transit Union 757, tangled up in an ugly showdown with management over health benefits, is claiming that TriMet managers are intentionally downplaying the number of times riders assault bus and train operators.

TriMet officials have maintained that serious assaults on its drivers -- while a heinous reality of the job -- are rare. ATU, however, is circulating a list of 130 reported incidents dating to May 2010 that it says have been intentionally hidden from the public.

Operations managers at the transit agency say most of the cases – dozens of incidents of riders spitting on drivers, for example – don’t meet the legal definition of assault and many reports were later found to be unsubstantiated.

“The ATU leadership’s accusations are inaccurate and the document (supplied by the union) contains just initial information inputted by a controller or dispatcher,” said Roberta Altstadt, a TriMet spokeswoman, in an email.

Fair or not, the ATU’s “list of invisible assaults,” which is it says it plans to make public, is demonstrative of how the union is taking its fight to keep its generous health-care benefits to the people. The public, said Bruce Hansen, ATU 757 president, needs to know about the on-the-job hazards that operators face every day.

“There is a reason that we need the (health care) benefits that we have fought for,” Hansen said. “Failing to record theses assaults goes to show how TriMet tries to deceive the public, whether its with operator assaults or wages.”

Of course, not all of the “reported assaults” on documents shared with The Oregonian involve weapons or flying fists. In fact, the average person would probably dismiss many of them – thrown cups of coffee, spitting and a snowball thrown through an open driver’s window – as small potatoes.

<a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/7866985/">Do you thinking spitting at bus driver should be considered assault?</a>

But ATU claims bus drivers consider them attacks that make it hard for them to safely ferry passengers in the Portland metro area, while destroying morale on the job.

What's more, Hansen said, TriMet needs to start taking spit attacks more seriously, especially since some diseases can be transmitted by saliva if it gets in a driver's eye or mouth.

Under Oregon law, spitting on a law enforcement or corrections officer is classified as assault. But the statute doesn't apply to other public employees.



Hansen said other incidents on the list clearly cross a line that TriMet isn’t willing to acknowledge. In one case, a driver reported that she asked a man who was vomiting at the back of a bus to step off. A woman traveling with the man reportedly responded by shoving the driver and throwing paper towels drenched with vomit at her.

“That one just disgusted me when I saw it,” Hansen said.

Altstadt said the agency takes reports of menacing or physical attacks against its drivers seriously. But TriMet, she said, doesn’t determine definitions of crimes. Police analysts, guided by the FBI’s Uniformed Crime Reporting, define many of the initial calls on the list don't meet the definition of assault -- even if they're found to be true.



“Spitting – even in the face – is generally categorized as harassment but may be categorized as an assault by the PPB crime records specialist depending on the full details of the incident,” she said.

In countless cases, Altstadt said, harassment, assaults and concerns about weapons on the transit system turn out to be baseless.

As an example, Altstadt recalled a recent report from a train operator who said a rider spotted an elderly woman in a trailing car who apparently had a “shotgun.” In the end, it turned out to be a cane.

“Our staff looks into each security related incident -- again, crime or not -- to see how security might be improved,” Altstadt said. “We are also transparent about reported crimes on our system.”

On the long list of incidents being circulated by the ATU to the media, the most common type is passengers spitting at drivers. (Not surprisingly, most reported confrontations result from bus drivers simply asking free-loaders to pay their fare.)

Whether or not you believe the next contract with TriMet union workers should maintain the most generous public-employee health benefits in Oregon, the ATU list serves as a reminder that your bus driver deserves a big “thank you” during the evening commute.

Of course, you might want to think twice about trying to hug him or her. One of the reported assaults was an unwanted kiss.

Here’s the complete list of reported incidents -- which TriMet says are largely unverified initial calls -- broken down by type from May 2010 to the end of 2013:

Spitting: 65 reported.

Punch, hit, slap, shove, grab: 48.

Assault with fluid (coffee, soda, water, beer): 8.

Finger or fingernail poke: 4.

Stabbing: 3.

Assault with bicycle: 2.

Assault with wallet or purse: 2.

Snow ball: 1.

Vomit assault: 1.

Flying rock: 1.

Hit by car: 1.

Stick: 1.

Trash can: 1.

##765|China announced over the weekend it would expand the daily yuan trading band against the US dollar beginning on Monday as the country pushes for a more internationalized currency and market-based financial sector.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, announced on Saturday that it would double the fluctuation bandwidth of the yuan's exchange rate against the US dollar to 2.0 percent above or below a daily reference exchange rate from its previous 1.0 percent limit, effective from Monday.

The move, which came earlier than the market had expected, signals that China is confident that its economy is stable enough to cope with a more volatile yuan and further reforms in the financial market, economists said.

"Expanding the trading range of the yuan against the dollar and facilitating the rate's two-way fluctuation can help sustain China's foreign trade and economic growth, as the country's economy is slowing down and its international payments is near balanced," wrote Bank of Communications economists in a note sent to the Global Times Saturday.

The last time the range was expanded was in April 2012, when the PBC doubled a bandwidth of 0.5 percent to 1 percent.

The central bank said in a statement that the yuan "does not have a basis for significant appreciation" after the range widened, noting that China's trade surplus represents only 2.1 percent of its GDP.

Also, the currency is not expected to depreciate either, the PBC said, because the country's financial risk is under control and it has plenty of foreign exchange reserves to cushion external shocks.

Analysts believe that the PBOC engineered a decline of the yuan from late February to early March, in order to shake off speculators who bet on the currency's appreciation to make profits. The purpose of that move, analysts said, was to leave a market with more rational traders and less risk of volatility when the band is widened.

Lu Ting, Hong Kong-based China economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said in a note sent to the Global Times over the weekend that the exchange rate of the yuan to the US dollar is very close to an equilibrium level, so neither appreciation nor depreciation would happen in the near term.

The yuan rose 2.9 percent against the greenback in 2013, and ended at 6.15 yuan per US dollar on Friday.

Liu Dongliang, a senior analyst at China Merchants Bank, told the Global Times Sunday that any further widening of the trading range will not be highly effective and is unlikely.

"A bandwidth of 2 percent is more than enough," he said.

"Now the central bank needs to consider loosening its tight grip on the central parity rate."

The widened bandwidth, which leads to more market-oriented pricing of the yuan, will boost sales of products such as yuan forex options, Liu noted.

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100m policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“No one company can afford to take a $201m hit,” said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a “well-known billionaire”.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen’s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen’s policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: “He wants his next of kin to keep working hard.”

He said the annual premium is in “the low single digits of millions of dollars”. He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire’s age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances’s firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.##767|##768|Empty##769|Car and equipment rental firm Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) Tuesday reported a narrower loss for the fourth quarter, as revenues grew about 10 percent mainly due to acquisition of Dollar Thrifty. Both adjusted earnings per share as well as revenues missed analysts' expectations.

The firm also forecast adjusted earnings per share for first quarter and full year 2014 below estimates.

Separately, Hertz said its board approved plans to separate Hertz car and equipment rental businesses into two independent, publicly traded companies. In addition, the board approved a new share repurchase program totaling $1 billion which replaces the existing program.

The two companies would be 'Hertz,' comprised of the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly rental car businesses as well as Donlen, a provider of fleet leasing and management services, and 'HERC,' the Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.

The separation is intended to be in the form of a tax-free spin-off to Hertz shareholders. Hertz would receive net cash proceeds from a HERC spin-off of around $2.5 billion, which would be used to pay down Hertz debt and support the newly approved $1 billion share buyback program. The HERC separation is expected to be complete by early 2015.

For the fourth quarter, net loss attributable to Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., and Subsidiaries' common stockholders was $0.6 million or break even per share, compared to a loss of $36.8 million or $0.09 per share in the prior year.

On an adjusted basis, earnings per share totaled $0.26, while the firm posted $0.33 per share a year earlier. On average, 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $0.32 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.

Mark Frissora, CEO said, "In a difficult fourth quarter, we achieved an adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 despite an estimated $0.12 impact of lower than expected pricing and higher expenses related to carrying extra fleet."

Worldwide revenues for the quarter grew 10.2 percent to $2.56 billion, but came below analysts' estimate of $2.62 billion.

U.S. car rental segment revenues increased 14.1 percent to $1.48 billion, mainly due to Dollar Thrifty, which was acquired on November 19, 2012, partially offset by the December 2012 divestiture of Advantage. U.S. off-airport total revenues rose 9.8 percent.

The U.S. average number of company-operated vehicles was 472,200, an increase of 22.4 percent from a year ago, largely due to the acquisition of Dollar Thrifty.

International car rental revenues were $544.2 million, up 5.8 percent from last year. Revenues from worldwide equipment rental were $400.9 million, an increase of 4 percent from last year.

Looking ahead to the first quarter, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.09. Analysts project first-quarter earnings of $0.19 per share.

For full year 2014, the firm anticipates adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.00. Revenues are expected to be between $11.40 billion and $11.70. Street currently is looking for 2014 earnings of $2.07 per share, on annual revenues of $11.60 billion.

HTZ closed Monday's regular trading at $27.22, up 4.77 percent. In the pre-market activity on Tuesday, the shares are up 1.03 percent.

He also said Scotland would need currency reserves “multiple times” the size of its GDP to withstand tests by the international markets on the SNP’s preferred option of a currency union, or in it continuing to informally use the pound in a process known as “sterlingisation”.

Mark Carney warned that sterlingisation would leave Scotland without a lender of last resort. Picture: PA

Giving evidence to Westminster’s Treasury select committee, Mr Carney also said that an independent Scotland would have to commit to joining the euro if it wanted to be a member of the European Union (EU).

But the Bank boss said he had at no time said if he was for or against a post-Yes currency union.

The SNP last night welcomed Mr Carney’s “neutrality”, but the pro-Union Better Together campaign said the party’s position on currency was not credible.

Mr Carney’s comment about RBS having to relocate was made with reference to an EU directive requiring banks to have their headquarters located in states where most of their customers live.

Asked if this would mean RBS would have to move its headquarters to somewhere in the rest of the UK if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: “It’s a distinct possibility but I shouldn’t prejudge it. It depends on their arrangements as well.”

Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie commented: “‘Distinct possibility’ is a central bank phrase with a sort of layer of lawyer on top.”

Mr Carney said it was a matter of European law, and if the remainder of the UK without Scotland was regarded as a continuing state in the EU. He said he took the views of European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso as a “starting point”. Mr Carney added: “Scotland would have to apply to join the European Union [and] that application, as for any new application to join the EU, would include a commitment to join the euro in the fullness of time.”

Mr Barroso has previously said it would be “extremely difficult” for an independent Scotland to join the EU, a claim the Scottish Government has described as “pretty preposterous”.

Yesterday, Mr Carney also told MPs that any “informal adoption” of sterling by an independent Scotland would mean the country losing the lender of last resort facilities of the Bank of England. He told the committee the Bank “can act as lender of last resort to branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks” but said that it did not have to.

He described a currency union as a “political question which the major political parties have ruled out”, but added that the Bank had “done work on these issues” and “was well appraised of the potential risks”.

He said his own speech on the subject in Edinburgh in January, when he talked of countries involved in a currency union having to cede some sovereignty, was a “technocratic assessment”.

He added: “At no time have I said that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union.”

Conservative Chancellor George Osborne, his Labour counterpart Ed Balls and Liberal Democrat Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander have already ruled out the possibility of a currency union.

Yesterday, Mr Carney warned the option of “sterlingisation” would leave Scotland without a lender of last resort. He said that, while a currency union would see the Bank of England’s services currently provided to Scotland “passported over”, each one would “have to be reviewed” without a currency union.

He agreed with MPs that a currency union or sterlingisation “would be tested by the markets” because it “would be seen as a temporary arrangement” and this would mean Scotland would need substantial currency reserves to withstand this.

Asked by Labour MP Pat McFadden whether £6 billion of reserves would be enough, Mr Carney pointed to the example of Hong Kong, where the currency is pegged to the US dollar, to suggest it was too little.

Mr Carney said: “Hong Kong has reserves multiple times the size of its GDP, £6bn is not multiple times Scotland’s GDP.”

He insisted that, in a currency union, Scotland’s economy would still need to be integrated, undermining any economic independence for an independent Scotland. He also agreed with Mr McFadden’s assessment that attempts to create a currency union is to “recreate what Scotland already has” being in the UK.

Mr Carney suggested if an independent Scotland wanted to join the EU, any arrangement would be temporary because it would have to commit to joining the euro.

He said for the eurozone to remain viable it needs “to build a form of fiscal federalism” and said that this would need to be considered with a sterling zone.

He also said the Bank of England has made no plans on governance in the event of independence, adding that this would be a “political decision” made by the UK government.

SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie said: “Mark Carney was clear the issue he wanted to get across was the nature of the stability arrangements which are required for the formation of a successful currency union.

“I am pleased that the Scottish Government’s fiscal commission working group have described in detail a blueprint for such a successful currency union.”

A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The Governor restated the neutrality of the Bank of England in the referendum debate and made very clear that the Bank will implement whatever monetary arrangements are put in place by the two governments. Mr Carney also made clear that people ‘shouldn’t pre-judge’ post-independence arrangements.

“The EU directive referred to is aimed at preventing companies taking advantage of different regulatory regimes. We propose harmonised regulation across a sterling area, so after independence banks would continue to operate under the same standards.”

However, pro-UK politicians said the governor’s evidence had dealt a blow to Alex Salmond.

Labour shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson said: “Yet again the governor of the Bank of England has outlined in the clearest, but most diplomatic of terms, why Alex Salmond’s plans are nothing more than assertion and wishful thinking.

“It’s time for the SNP to come clean and tell us what their Plan B is on currency.”

A spokesman for the Better Together campaign said: “What people in Scotland need is clarity from Alex Salmond about his Plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we have to sign up to the euro, as Mark Carney said, or would we set up an unproven separate currency?

“No doubt Alex Salmond’s response will be the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans – Mark Carney is wrong and only the First Minister is right. It simply isn’t credible.”

FINLAND WASTING

FUNDS ON FIRMS

MANUFACTURING

FINLAND is using public funds to prop up companies with no hope of surviving on their own, according to the head of the country's biggest business park operator Technopolis Oyj. "We're putting a lot of money into saving old industries," Technopolis chief executive Keith Silverang said. "It's a waste, we can't save them." Mr Silverang is urging the government to change its policy and help Finland's economy recover by channelling funds into growth industries.

Finland's economy has contracted for three of the past five years, depleting state coffers and destroying jobs.

As demand for the nation's forestry products and mobile phones evaporates, Finland has struggled to replace those markets.

Industrial production slumped an annual 7.5pc in January, falling for a 15th consecutive month. Meanwhile the state is investing about €195m in Outokumpu Oyj, a stainless-steel company that hasn't booked a profit since 2007.

UNDIE GIANTS GO HEAD-TO-HEAD

MODELLING

VICTORIA'S Secret will face off with one of its most famous Angels, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, when its first store opens in Brazil later this year. The Brazilian model – who strutted the runway as a Victoria's Secret Angel in its annual fashion show until 2007 – is teaming up with closely held lingerie maker Hope to open the first Gisele Bundchen Intimates store in Sao Paulo in May. A Victoria's Secret-branded shop is set to open its doors in the South American capital the very same month.

A celebrity like Bundchen, "if you're small and unknown, is going to put you on the radar in a way that not many other branding and marketing tactics would," said Leslie Farnsworth, chief executive of FrogDog, a Houston-based marketing consultancy. "But there are huge risks." Celebrities can become overexposed with too many endorsements or overshadow the brands they are meant to be highlighting, she said. Bundchen also hawks Oral B Whitestrips and clothing for retailer Colcci.

GREEKS PROTEST AT ANTI-AUSTERITY

EUROPEAN AFFAIRS

GREEK public sector workers have shut schools and left hospitals on emergency staffing levels to protest against thousands more job cuts demanded by foreign lenders even as unemployment holds near record highs. Doctors, teachers and school guards joined the 24-hour strike and planned marches to parliament, the focal point of anti-austerity protests, where lawmakers will debate a draft bill on public sector reforms. Greece's lenders have demanded 11,400 public sector lay-offs this year, the fifth straight year of job cuts in the sector, but labour unions fear the country will have to impose even more wage and pension cuts in the coming years to meet the targets of its €240bn bailout deal with the EU and IMF.

"They won't stop unless we stop them," public sector union ADEDY, which organised the walkout, said in a statement, calling the reforms "an attack on workers' rights". Anti-austerity sentiment remains high in Greece, where repeated bouts of belt-tightening since it was rescued from bankruptcy in 2010 have left three times as many Greeks jobless, pushed up homelessness and eroded living standards.

NORWAY SAY F1 STAKE A MISTAKE

COMMODITIES

Norway's $840bn oil fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has admitted that investing in Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Group was a mistake. In May, the fund paid $1.6bn for a 21.3pc share of the group in a consortium with two other funds, BlackRock and Waddell & Reed Financial. "Yes, we have made a mistake," fund director Yngve Slyngstad has now conceded, suggesting the fund may try to offload its stake.

The sovereign wealth fund invests surplus oil revenue to guarantee the continuation of Norway's generous welfare benefits for future generations. Started in the 1990s, the fund has shares in 8,213 companies around the world. The purchase of a stake in Formula One was criticised by some politicians and by Norwegian media as falling short of the fund's strict ethical rules.

The Formula One Group, which manages the sport's commercial rights, is run by Bernie Ecclestone, who is to go on trial on corruption charges in Munich in April . The 83-year-old was charged in July over a $44m payment he made to former German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky, which was linked to the sale of F1 championship rights.

COFFEE SHAKE-UP AT STARBUCKS

TECHNOLOGY

STARBUCKS, the world's largest coffee-shop operator, will test a mobile phone service for ordering items ahead of time at some US cafes this year as it looks to bolster its smartphone applications. Starbucks is "actively working" on mobile ordering, according to Adam Brotman, chief digital officer at the Seattle-based company. "It's something our customers have asked for," he said. "We're not revealing a lot of details about it now."

Starbucks, which has more than 20,000 locations worldwide, has been focused on expanding and improving its rewards programme and mobile apps to help boost sales. Last month, chief executive Howard Schultz handed over day-to-day operations to Troy Alstead, chief operating officer, so he can focus on "next-generation" commerce. Schultz is "working directly on all of the mobile plans and vision we are putting together," Brotman said.

On March 19 the company will update its iPhone app to include barista tipping and a new shake-to-pay function. More than 11pc of the company's US store transactions are carried out with a mobile device, Mr Brotman said.

fdawson@theprovince.com##783|Not too long ago, emerging markets were the reason the global economy was growing at 5% or more. Now, the reason why the global economy is not growing at those levels is because of emerging, not developed markets.

Given that emerging economies now account for over half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major emerging markets is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said Tuesday in its Interim Economic Assessment. OECD did not give a world GDP forecast, but did provide forecasts for individual nations or regions. The report focused on G7 countries.

OECD forecasts first quarter growth in G7 countries of 2.2%, dropping to 2% in the second quarter pulled down by Japan.

Long-standing risks remain. Japan is only just beginning to confront its daunting fiscal challenges, fragilities in the euro area are still acute, and the possibility persists of a sharp slowdown in China driven by balance sheet effects, said Rintaro Tamaki, deputy secretary-general of OECD and chief economist.

In addition, the adjustment of monetary policy in advanced economies -- primarily Fed tapering -- continues to pose a risk to stability in some emerging economies, and crises there could spread and in turn exert a drag on growth in advanced economies.

Trend growth has slowed in the emerging markets, once the steam engine of world GDP.

There has already been a slowdown in most emerging markets even before the Fed started talking about tapering. The initial Fed impact on emerging markets was limited at first, but that changed at the start of the year with currency pressures in Brazil and Turkey.

For some emerging economies, capital flows could decline and lead to an additional drag on growth. Such a drag could hurt other countries, including advanced economies that sell goods and services to these new markets.

"We recommend the U.S. taper gradually and include better communication to avoid problems. A lot of this will depend on the monetary policy responses by emerging markets," Tamaki said in a press conference.

Tamaki singled out China in particular for overspending at the municipal level, where shadow banking has been designed to invest in companies with no investment returns. "China needs tighter monetary policies. In both advanced and emerging market economies, the growth slowdown since the crisis reflects a combination cyclical weakness and structural weakness."

China is, however, less exposed to Fed tapering than other emerging markets. The effectiveness of the policy response will differ from country to country.

The problem here is that the slowdown in growth in emerging markets has been partially to blame on tighter monetary policies, suggesting emerging markets may be boxed into a corner. Investors therefore will have to spend more time kicking the tires, and take a more active approach to investing in these markets.

The major averages have all moved to the downside, although selling pressure has remained relatively subdued.

Currently, the major averages are posting modest losses, near their lows for the young session. The Dow is down 66.73 points or 0.4 percent at 16,385.99, the Nasdaq is down 6.95 points or 0.2 percent at 4,329.27 and the S&P 500 is down 4.19 points or 0.2 percent at 1,873.85.

The early weakness on Wall Street comes on the heels of the release of disappointing Chinese trade data, with a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.

With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.

Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.

The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.

Nonetheless, trading activity on Wall Street has remained somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "In the U.S., the important economic data of the week doesn't come until Thursday's retail sales and Friday's PPI, and with commodity prices at the highest level since October '12, inflation numbers should now be a focus."

Steel stocks have moved sharply lower, however, with worries about the outlook for Chinese demand weighing on the sector. The NYSE Arca Steel Index has fallen by 2.2 percent, hitting a five-month intraday low.

Gold, housing and defense stocks are also seeing early weakness, while most of the other major sectors are showing only modest moves.

In overseas trading, stock across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8 percent.

Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.4 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.1 percent.

In the bond market, treasuries are showing a lack of direction amid a quiet day on the U.S. economic front. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is unchanged at 2.79 percent.

With a shortage of young people signing up for Obamacare, the Department of Health and Human Services is using March Madness to urge basketball and other sports fans to enroll in a health care plan by the March 31 deadline.



In order to stress the importance of health coverage, HHS and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition released new data looking at the cost of treating common sports injuries.

The most common sports injuries were ankle or knee sprains and leg fractures, according to the new data. The estimated rates of sports-related injuries were higher among children and young adults under the age of 25.

An estimated 12 million people between the ages of 5 and 22 years suffer a sports-related injury annually, the data found. About 20 percent of all injury-related ER visits involve children and teens aged 6 to 19.



It can be costly to treat even a minor sports injury, HHS said. For instance, a sprained ankle can cost a person $2,20, while charges for a broken arm average nearly $7,700.

"That broken arm would take almost 10 years to pay off at that rate without considering interest or harm to your credit," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote on her blog.

"Whether you're out on the slopes or playing the boss in a pickup game of basketball after that stressful meeting, you don't want to have to hold back because you aren't covered in case of injury," she said.

Miami Heat forward and former Duke University star Shane Battier told reporters during a press conference Tuesday that he's personally had over 90 stitches, 25 ankle sprains, over 50 X-rays and MRIs and now has early-onset arthritis from his athletic career.

"There is a health risk that comes from playing sports...chances are you're going to get banged up at some point," he said. "Play hard, be smart and get covered."

People can sign up for health insurance 24 hours a day, seven days a week online at HealthCare.gov, which Sebelius said is now working smoothly, or by calling 1-800-318-2596.

To get in-person help in your own community, visit localhelp.healthcare.gov and punch in your zip code.

People who miss the March 31 deadline will have to wait until November 2014 before they can enroll again.##790|Obama extending old insurance plans not expected to do much. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius applauds a remark by U.S. President Barack Obama on the successes of the Affordable Care Act in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. UPI/Pat Benic | License Photo

NEW YORK, March 15 (UPI) -- The Obama administration's two-year extension of health insurance polices canceled for not meeting minimum standards should have little impact, an expert says.

Sara Collins, a vice president at The Commonwealth Fund, a non-profit group which conducts research on healthcare, said the administration wrote a letter last November to state insurance commissioners encouraging, but not requiring, them to allow non-compliant insurance policies to the Affordable Care Act that were canceled, or slated for cancellation, to be renewed for 2014.

Non-compliant plans might offer less comprehensive coverage, put people at risk for unaffordable medical bills, or charge premiums based on health status, Collins wrote in a Commonwealth Fund blog.

Earlier this month, the administration extended the policy, allowing renewals of existing policies in the individual and small-group insurance markets through October 2016.

"While the extension carries some risks for the nation's newly regulated insurance markets, its ultimate effects are likely to be small," Collins wrote in the blog.

"While only the nation's insurers know how many people have renewed health plans that are not compliant with the Affordable Care Act, the number is likely small. Research by Georgetown's Center for Health Insurance Reforms last year reported that several states had already allowed carriers to renew existing policies prior to the policy change. In addition, 21 states and the District of Columbia decided not to allow plans to extend policies."

In addition, most people who are eligible for premium and cost-sharing subsidies would likely switch to plans that meet the ACA standards because they'll be paying the same or less out-of-pocket for better coverage, Collins said.

"If the people who keep their sub-standard health insurance plans are healthier than average -- which is likely since they were all underwritten based on health for pre-2014 coverage -- their removal from the pool of people with policies that meet the law's benefit standards will lower that pool's average health status, and could lead to higher premiums next year," Collins said.

"Some actuaries of major health plans who participated in a recent meeting sponsored by The Commonwealth Fund did view the administration's policy as potentially moving healthy people out of those pools and increasing uncertainty about the health composition of those risk pools in 2014. But others expected the decision to have a limited effect, given that only 28 states are allowing the practice. The Rand Corp. estimated the administration's policy might increase 2015 premiums by 1 percent."

The administration's policy goes against Congress's intent that the Affordable Care Act both increase consumer protections for insurance and move people into larger pools of shared risk to help maintain lower premiums for everyone over time.

"While some Americans will find comfort in the option to keep their sub-standard policies, the Affordable Care Act's biggest benefits -- including lower out-of-pocket costs and subsidized coverage -- will go to those millions of eligible people who are signing up for the law's new protections," Collins said.##791|Germany is adding its voice to calls for Macedonia to push ahead with an accord with Greece to change the country's name, putting it on a path toward...##792|Empty##793|(Changes attribution in paragraph five to a U.S. defense official, not Kirby)

* U.S. Navy commandos storm vessel in international waters

* Raid likely to halt Libyan rebel attempts to ship oil

By Ulf Laessing and Feras Bosalum

TRIPOLI, March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. special forces have seized a tanker that fled with a cargo of oil from a Libyan port controlled by anti-government rebels, halting their attempt to sell crude on the global market.

Gunmen demanding regional autonomy and a share of oil wealth had managed to load the ship, which escaped Libya’s navy and triggered a crisis that prompted parliament to sack the prime minister.

A U.S. SEAL commando team boarded the tanker Morning Glory from a Naval special warfare rigid inflatable boat as it sat in international waters off Cyprus on Sunday night.

The seizure was approved by U.S. President Barack Obama and requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

No one was hurt in the under two hour operation, and no shots fired. Two AK47 rifles were found and the three Libyans holding the ship remained in U.S. control, a U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained” from the Libyan port of Es Sider, Kirby’s statement said.

The standoff over Libyan oil and the tanker debacle have deepened the chaos testing Tripoli since the civil war that toppled Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.

With its army still nascent, a weak government has been unable to impose its will on former anti-Gaddafi fighters and militias who now use their military muscle to make demands on the state, often by targeting the vital oil sector.

At least in the short term, the tanker’s seizure by U.S. forces is likely to prevent any more attempted oil sales by the rebels, who in August took control of three export terminals accounting previously for 700,000 barrels a day of exports.

“Oil is the economy’s artery. The government will not allow anyone to fool around with the assets and resources of the Libyan people,” the Libyan government said in a statement.

It was the second time in six months that U.S. forces have become involved in Libya. A commando team snatched a suspected al Qaeda suspect off the street as he returned home from prayers in the capital Tripoli in September.

The Cypriot foreign ministry said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a U.S. military escort.

An American crew from the USS Stout, a guided missile destroyer, got the tanker underway toward Libya on Monday. The Stout voyage was expected to take up to four days, the officials said.

The Morning Glory had been North Korean-flagged, but the government in Pyongyang on Thursday said it had notified Libya and maritime authorities that it had severed all ties with the ship because of the vessel’s contraband cargo.

So Se Pyong, North Korea’s ambassador in Geneva, said on Monday he discussed the situation with his Libyan counterpart to explain, but not apologise for the situation.

He said North Korea did not buy oil from Libyan rebels, and since the Egyptian-based shipping firm had acting illegally he was not concerned about the U.S. Navy seizure.

“Whether it was captured by the Americans, or by someone else, if that ship was doing something wrong, then we don’t care,” So told Reuters.

There was no immediate reaction from the federalist rebels, based in eastern Libya.

Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said on Saturday his group was ready to negotiate an end to the port blockade, but the government needed to abandon plans to mount a military offensive.

But analysts said it was uncertain whether government troops would be able effectively to confront the heavily armed rebels, made up of soldiers who defected from an oil protection force.

LEAR JET TO CYPRUS

The tanker’s escape highlighted the weakness of government forces, which had claimed several times that the 37,000-tonne ship was under their control only for the vessel to slip into international waters after a firefight.

Still, the intervention gives a boost to the fragile Libyan government in its fight to impose order. The transition to democracy has been upset by tribal, regional and political disputes.

Western powers, worried that it might fracture or slide deeper into chaos, have been training Libyan armed forces and cajoling conflicting parties in government to reach a settlement, with little progress.

A successful sale of Libyan oil outside government control, though, was always going to be complicated for the rebels.

A Cypriot police source said three men - described as two Israelis and a Senegalese - were detained for questioning on Saturday on suspicion of attempting to buy the tanker’s cargo, but were freed after a court refused to issue an arrest warrant.

Two of the men carried diplomatic passports - one from Senegal and one from a central African country, the security source said.

The source said they flew a Lear Jet into Cyprus on Friday evening, chartered a vessel from a yachting marina in Larnaca and headed to the tanker.

“They spoke to somebody on board the vessel, then left. At Larnaca marina police called them in for questioning,” the source said. The men left for Tel Aviv after being freed.

The Libyan navy opened fire on a Maltese-flagged tanker trying to approach Es Sider in January, but analysts say a full military confrontation with the port rebels would be unlikely.

The government fears federalism might open the door for secession and similar protests by other regions, though the rebels say they do not want to break up Libya.

Tripoli faces a budget crisis as oil production has fallen to a little over 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 1.4 million bpd in summer when protests at oilfields and ports started.

And to about one-third of the country’s uninsured, the deadline doesn’t matter because they are choosing to go without coverage.

This is according to a new survey from the folks at Bankrate.com, which found that, of those opting to face the penalty instead of obtaining coverage, 41% said it was because they believed that insurance is too expensive for them.

However, the survey also found that only 30% of uninsured Americans are even aware of subsidies and tax credits that are available to bring down the cost. That’s virtually the same number (29%) as those who incorrectly believe there are no such credits, and markedly below the 41% of uninsured people who admitted to not knowing about these subsidies.

Another reason given for choosing to not get coverage was opposition to the Affordable Care Act. This was the answer for about 1-in-6 of those people who said they will not get insurance by the March 31 deadline. That group was dominated by males, who were nearly three times more likely to give this reason than females.

The 18-29 year-old demographic has been the subject of much of the marketing for the ACA, but the Bankrate survey found what you’d probably expect to find among this age group — a sense of invincibility and a perceived immunity from all things that could make you sick or kill you — with 31% of uninsured young adults saying they simply don’t need insurance because they are healthy.

Just remember that thought when a piano or anvil falls on top of you from a comical height.

Whatever you decide to do, and whatever your reasons are, just know that the deadline is March 31. That way, you’re truly making a decision to obtain or not obtain coverage, rather than simply letting the deadline pass because you weren’t aware of it.##795|Empty##796|Empty##797|An Indonesian Air Force officer draws a flight pattern flown earlier in a search operation for the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, during a post-mission briefing at Suwondo air base in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, Thursday, March 13, 2014.

By CHRIS BRUMMITT and JIM GOMEZ, Associated Press

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — An oil slick on the sea. A purported wrong turn to the west seen on military radar. Questionable satellite photos. Passengers boarding with stolen passports.

After six days, what seemed like potential clues to the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have all led nowhere.

"This situation is unprecedented. MH370 went completely silent over the open ocean," said acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. "This is a crisis situation. It is a very complex operation, and it is not obviously easy. We are devoting all our energies to the task at hand."

On Thursday, Malaysian authorities expanded their search westward toward India, saying the aircraft with 239 people aboard may have flown for several hours after its last contact with the ground shortly after takeoff early Saturday from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

The U.S. Navy 7th Fleet said it is moving one of its ships, the USS Kidd, into the Strait of Malacca, west of Malaysia.

The international search is methodically sweeping the ocean on both sides of Malaysia. The total area being covered is about 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers) — about the size of Portugal.

One part of the hunt is in the South China Sea, where the aircraft was seen on civilian radar flying northeast before vanishing without any indication of technical problems. A similar-sized search is also being conducted in the Strait of Malacca because of military radar sightings that might indicate the plane turned in that direction after its last contact, passing over the Malay Peninsula.

The jet had enough fuel to reach deep into the Indian Ocean.

"Because of new information, we may be part of an effort to open a new search area in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney said, declining to offer additional details about that information or the new area.

In the latest disappointment, search planes failed to find any debris from the Boeing 777 after they were sent Thursday to an area of the South China Sea off the southern tip of Vietnam where satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects.

"There is nothing. We went there. There is nothing," Hishammuddin said.

Compounding the frustration, he later said the Chinese Embassy had notified the government the images were released by mistake and did not show any debris from the missing flight.

The Wall Street Journal quoted U.S. investigators as saying they suspected the plane stayed in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing engine data automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program. The newspaper later corrected the account to say the information came from the plane's satellite communication link, not the engines.

A U.S. official on Thursday said the plane was sending signals to a satellite for four hours after the aircraft went missing, an indication that it was still flying.

The official said the plane wasn't transmitting data to the satellite, but sending out a signal to establish contact. Boeing offers a satellite service that can receive a stream of data during flight on how the aircraft is functioning.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly, said Malaysia Airlines didn't subscribe to that service, but the system was automatically pinging the satellite anyway.

Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said: "Of course. We can't rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. We are expanding our search into the Andaman Sea." The sea is northwest of the Malay Peninsula.

He said Malaysia was asking for radar data from India and other neighboring countries to see if they can trace it flying northwest. India says its navy, air force and coast guard will search for the plane in the south Andaman Sea.

More than two-thirds of those on Flight MH370 were from China, which has shown impatience with the absence of any results. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday in Beijing he would like to see better coordination among countries in the search.

The passengers' "families and friends are burning with anxiety. The Chinese government and Chinese people are all deeply concerned about their safety," he said at the close of the annual session of the country's legislature. "As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will not stop searching for the plane."

He said China had eight ships and 10 satellites searching for the plane.

Malaysia has been criticized for its handling of the search, in part because it took several days to fully explain why it couldn't say whether the plane had turned back. Officials say they are not hiding anything and are searching areas where the plane is most likely to be, while trying to establish its actual location.

Besides the Chinese satellite photos and the so-far fruitless search based on the possible sighting on military radar, there have been other developments in the aviation mystery that have failed to lead to finding the plane or the cause of its disappearance:

— Oil slicks seen Saturday were found to have nothing to do with the jetliner.

— A yellow object spotted by a search plane turned out to be ordinary sea trash.

— Officials initially said four or five passengers checked in for the flight but did not board, fueling speculation about terrorism. Officials later said some people with reservations never checked in and were simply replaced by standby passengers, and no baggage was removed.

— Officials said two men, later identified as Iranians, boarded the plane with stolen passports. It was later reported that they were unlikely to be linked to terrorist groups.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the plane's disappearance.

Experts say a massive failure knocking out electrical systems, while unlikely, could explain why the transponders were not working. Another possibility is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.

"There is no real precedent for a situation like this. The plane just vanished," Hishammuddin said.

Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean, some debris should be floating even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.

Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.

The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.

The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called "Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!" and posted the stolen information there.

The information was contained in a 716 megabyte file which includes an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades as well as an internal SQl database administration tool and even Karpeles' own CV.

A note on the file add: "That fat f**k has been lying!!" The hackers also took over the Reddit account of Karpeles and posted the information there too. Reddit moderators have since removed the post, which said: "It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed."

Scam exposed

Despite the removal of the post, users of the bitcoin subreddit have made their position very clear, with one of the top posts on the forum saying:

"Mt. Gox scam was just exposed — MK [Mark Karpeles] officially stole our funds."

Karpeles has so far not responded to the claims.

The hackers added that the bitcoin community could use the relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialised tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data from the given download link to help expose what really went on at Mt. Gox.

The hackers have redacted any user details from the files.

Collapsed

Last month Japan-based MtGox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to a hack - 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Two weeks ago, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan.

The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, £38m, €46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.

The Tokyo-based company was the largest and most well-known bitcoin exchange in the world when the cryptocurrency shot to fame last year.

The exchange claims that problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins than were being recorded by the exchange.

Known as "transaction malleability", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.

The exchange's collapse led to the price of bitcoin crashing but the virtual currency has shown remarkable resilience and the price of the cryptocurrency has bounced back and is currently trading at £381 on the Coindesk index.##803|The CEO of OAO Gazprom (NASDAQOTH:OGZPY) has warned of a possible withholding of natural gas supplies to Ukraine, citing nearly $2 billion in unpaid bills amid the economic turmoil in the country.

The ongoing diplomatic crisis between Ukraine and Russia, along with Gazprom's status as an enormous Russian company, have made this billing dispute more critical. Several U.S. officials, including House Speaker John Boehner, are pushing for the U.S. to increase natural gas exports to blunt the influence of Gazprom.

A long, winding road to market

Getting U.S. natural gas on the international market has been a major struggle for producers for years. The Department of Energy has to approve every export, and the White House downplayed the chances of any major move, saying they don't see exports having much impact.

As a practical matter, that's probably true. Ukraine's non-payment is a bigger issue than anything, and U.S. producers aren't going to be any more willing to give them free gas than Gazprom is. Still, there's a silver lining to all of this.

Gas export complexities aren't a brand new problem, but they're something that has rarely gotten any political attention. The Ukraine situation may be just the excuse needed to get some much-needed attention for this problem, and even if the administration is unwilling to change policies now, with upcoming elections there could be a shift toward more action on freeing the market.

Who benefits?

With a lot of excess production available, the domestic price of natural gas is not expected to see a major impact from the exports. Prices are higher overseas, however, and having access to those markets at all could be a windfall for major producers, who can more easily grab some of that market share in Europe and Asia.

The biggest potential winner is Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), the largest gas-focused producer in the U.S. The company is trading at a modest price right now with plenty of room to run, though with a current ratio of only 0.66 and a lot of debt there is more risk there than most.

Canadian-based Encana (NYSE:ECA) is a somewhat safer choice, though it is also higher priced. It is also growing somewhat slower than the industry average, so it's tough to consider it a bargain at these prices.

The safest by far, in my opinion, is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), which has been putting a lot of money into expanding its natural gas business in recent years. The company has higher margins than the other two producers mentioned, and it has the lucrative oil business to fall back on if the natural gas boom doesn't materialize. It stands as a responsibly priced company that is growing natural gas production at just the right time.

And then there's Gazprom

After looking at those figures, this is another excellent time to look at the numbers on Gazprom itself, which dropped with the rest of the Russian stock market on the Ukraine crisis, and is trading at a criminally low price.

While the other companies are looking at P/Es in the teens, Gazprom's P/E is hovering around 2, and trading at roughly a quarter of its book value. The company has much higher margins than other natural gas-centric plays, and is a market leader.

Rather, Gazprom is the market leader, by far the largest natural gas company in the world. The company sees ten times the revenue of Chesapeake, and despite the panic selling over Ukraine, the company is irreplaceable to Europe, and that's true no matter how quickly the U.S. majors can start getting more exports to market.

“Candy Crush,” which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King’s revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion – slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

“I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock,” said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc’s successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc’s shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

“I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace,” said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

“The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark.”

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

Another Zynga?

“Candy Crush” launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra “lives”.

Such stellar popularity has helped King’s revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fueled by “Candy Crush” rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.

Zynga’s stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of “Farmville” waned, while Finland’s Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of “Angry Birds”.

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King’s revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in “Candy Crush” gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as “Pet Rescue Saga” and “Farm Heroes Saga”. About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King’s five games for mobiles have drawn a “substantial fan base” Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (http://r.reuters.com/bar57v).

“The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion’s share of time spent.”

NYSE debut

King’s IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KING” on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company’s games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.

STOCK markets in most of Asia fell on Monday, affected by sluggish trade in China as well as a reduced forecast for the economic predictions in Japan.

Malaysia Airlines stocks fell on news of the disappearance of one of the airline’s passenger planes enrouted to China.

The Nikkei-225 of Japan closed down one percent at 15,120.13 and the Shanghai Composite Index of China declined 2.88 percent to 1,999.05. The Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong also fell 1.8 percent to 22,264.82.

Based on data, China’s exports stumbled by a surprisingly huge 18 percent last month, possibly diminishing hopes that further trade will help boost the sagging economy while communist officials push for ambitious trade reforms.

The official economic growth target of China for this year of 7.5 percent, bared last week by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, assumes trade will likewise improve by 7.6 percent. But data show combined exports and imports so far have dminished by 4.78 percent.

More deficits

Japan, on the other hand, reported a record account deficit for January, and cut its economic growth forecast for the October-December period to 0.7 percent from one percent.

According to Andres Sollivon, financial analyst in Hong Kong, sentiment was affected by the sluggish data from Japan and China.

Some experts also said that exports last month might have been ever emphasized by traders inflating sales numbers to elude financial controls and bring extra cash into Beijing.

Meanwhile in early European trading, the FTSE 100 of Britain increased 0.4 percent to 6,738.94. The CAC-40 of France gained 1.1 percent to 4,415.78 and the DAX of Germany added 0.2 percent to 9,373.68.

I have a hard time imagining that they will, but perhaps King has a secret strategy up its sleeve that we do not know about.

The company released an updated F-1 filing F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday that priced its shares at between $21 to $24. The company is offering a total of 22.2 million shares, 15.5 million of which are being offerd by King, with the other 6.6 million are being sold by shareholders.

That means that the company could net up to $532.8 million on the high end, higher than it's initial $500 million goal from its initial F-1 filing in February. King expects to be valued at $7.6 billion, or four times last year's sales.

This is all happening while King is seeing extremely high financial growth, but slowing usage, which could portend problems for the gaming studio as it tries to please investors.

In 2013, the company took home a profit of $568 million on $1.88 billion in revenue. That’s up from a profit of $7.8 million on revenue of $164 million in 2012. In 2011, it posted a loss of $1.3 million on $64 million in revenue.

Going from $164 million to $1.88 billion in one year is some pretty head spinning growth, so its no wonder that the company wants to strike while that iron is hot. The question is, though: can that be turned into long-term viability. Some of the heat has come off of Candy Crush Saga as of late.

In December 2013, King Digital saw its first quarterly decline in revenue and profit since March 2012. The company generated $159 million in profit on $602 million in revenue in the December 2013 quarter, which is down from $230 million in profit on $621 million in revenue in September 2013. And the company admits in its filing that the decline in revenue was due exclusively to a decline in Candy Crush gross bookings.

The problem is that so much of King's growth was reliant on Candy Crush, and the company has not yet proven that it is more than a one hit wonder.

Candy Crush Saga has 93 million daily active users, which is triple that of all of King Digital’s other games combined. Its next most popular game, Pet Rescue Saga, has 15 million daily active users, and just 129 million daily game plays, compared to Candy Crush’s 1.085 billion daily game plays.

In all, Candy Crush accounts for a full 78% of King Digital’s gross bookings.

Amid mounting evidence that the disappearance of the Malaysian plane was a deliberate act, authorities today said the last words from the cockpit were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot as search operations covering 11 countries were intensified.

Evidence indicating that the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 that went missing 10 days ago was sabotaged or hijacked was mounting after it emerged that the last message from the cockpit was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

The last words -- "All right, good night" were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a media briefing.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid are under scanner of the probe into the disappearance of the plane.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's final words.

The officials are also looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian - had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.

Malaysia's defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, "I can confirm that search and rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun. Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations."

A detailed map of the northern and southern corridors where the search operations were on was released today.

Malaysia got in touch with countries along the northern and southern corridors about the flight. These countries include: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and France.

Australian was leading the search of the remote southern Indian Ocean for the missing plane.

Kazakhstan joined the search today in the farthest northwest section of the search area, taking the total number of countries involved in the operation to 26.

During the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of China. Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search operation, Hishammuddin said.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday assured Najib of "all assistance" by Indian authorities when the latter called him to seek India's "technical assistance".

Najib last week said authorities are trying to trace the plane across two possible corridors - in the north to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

Hishamuddin said hopes had not been lost.

"There has been no distress call, no ransom demand, no parties claiming responsibility...so there is always hope," he said. He informed that aviation experts from China were joining the search team.

Hishamuddin said two Malaysian ships had been deployed and French civil aviation teams have also joined the search.

Australia is sending extra two P 3 Orions and C130 Hercules.

Malaysian authorities said they had begun probing the crew the day the aircraft disappeared.

Police have visited the houses of the pilot and the co-pilot twice.

The Chinese authorities who had already cleared the passengers on board have been asked to take a re-look.

Jauhari said so far there had been no evidence from phone companies of any passenger trying to call when the plane turned around.

Hishamuddin said Inmarsat had got six pings from the plane.

The satellite could see aircraft at alleviation and could give the time but not the location.

"At this point, I would like to stress that Malaysia has been co-operating with the FBI, Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities since day one," Hishamuddin said.

"Our priority has always been to find the aircraft. We would not withhold any information that could help. But we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigations team," he said.

"With support from our many international partners, this new phase of the search is underway. Assets are being deployed, and search and rescue operations have begun. I wish to thank our partners from around the world for their continued support," he added.##811|##812|Empty##813|Empty##814|The missing Flight 370 aircraft may lead to serious struggles in the struggling carrier’s future.

When it comes to airline insurance on a broad scale, the costs have been steadily dropping over the years as problems have become decreasingly common and crashes of any major sort have simply not been happening.

Malaysian Airline System could be facing its own coverage issues following the disappearance of its plane.

Flight 370 was carrying 239 people when it disappeared along its path from Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, to Beijing China. This type of situation, said Standard & Poor’s analyst in Singapore, Shukor Yusof, always has a deep impact on the reputation of a carrier. However, the specific details and the mystery surrounding the missing aircraft, and the likelihood that it led to a crash which produced two oil slicks in the ocean, could also mean that the company will be facing some unwanted changes to the cost of its airline insurance.

Aside from the airline insurance woes, a shadow has also been cast on the carrier’s management and shareholders.

Malaysian Airline System was already experiencing losses and was fighting to be able to overcome them. Less than three years ago, the carrier replaced its CEO, bringing in Ahmad Jauhari Yahya to help to bring itself into a situation of profitability. Now that the plane and 293 people have gone missing, this mission has become increasingly challenging for him.

The national, state controlled company had already been hit hard by September 2011, when the 59 year old veteran of the power industry stepped up as CEO. At that time, the stock was already slumping by a massive 63 percent. Its struggles included competition from low cost carriers and its use of non-viable routes. Over its past three financial years, it has faced a loss of $1.3 billion.

Now, as rescuers continue their desperate search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, this represents not only the second mishap the carrier has faced within six months (the last one being a crash landing of a Twin Otter DHC6 plane in October on a Borneo island, in which two people died), but it is also facing harm to its reputation and airline insurance status.##815|Empty##816|You are using an older browser version.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several U.S. institutional investors said they are closely monitoring the developments at Pimco, the world's largest bond firm, in the wake of Mohamed El-Erian's abrupt resignation as CEO and ensuing acrimony between him and co-founder Bill Gross.

The investors, including retirement systems, have formally put Pimco on "watch lists," a signal that they will keep a much closer eye its performance than usual. It could eventually lead to reductions in the amount of money they allocate to funds at the firm, whose full name is Pacific Investment Management Co and which has $1.91 trillion in assets.

"We intend to go out and meet with them over the course of the next month," said David Hunter, chief investment officer of the North Dakota State Investment Board. The board, which has about $400 million invested with Pimco, put the fund on its watch list on February 28.

Hunter said the board could ultimately decide not to make any changes to its allocation.

The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, said it had not placed Pimco on a formal watch list, but it was also paying close attention to developments.

"CalPERS staff has tremendous respect for the staff at Pimco," the system said in an emailed statement. "That being said, we are monitoring the issue and will keep our board aware of the changes."

In a statement, Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge said: "We are focused on communication with our clients, and have been in regular contact with them following the recent leadership transition. They understand the changes we have taken and why, and are ready to move forward with us."

In a Tweet on Monday, Gross wrote, "No distractions here - just long term performance satisfaction - working hard as always for clients."

The closer scrutiny by state and local pension systems shows that Gross, though, may have more work to do to assuage investor concerns after El-Erian's surprise departure and reports of growing discord between the two men amid weak fund performance.

Overall, customers withdrew $41.1 billion from Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund <PMBIX.O> last year, a record amount for the manager, according to investment research firm Morningstar. The fund posted another $1.6 billion in outflows in February, reducing assets to $236 billion and marking the 10th straight month of outflows. <ID: nL1N0LZ0N0>

The Total Return Fund, which Gross manages, trailed more than 70 percent of its peers in February.

Last month, a Wall Street Journal article described the worsening relationship between the two men as Pimco's performance deteriorated. Later, Gross told Reuters that El-Erian, who is due to leave the firm in less than a week, was trying to "undermine" him by talking to the Journal.

A memo from investment consultant NEPC to the City of Fresno Retirement System Joint Boards noted "an elevated level of concern" around the changes at Pimco.

During a recent on-site visit to the bond firm's offices, "it was clear that there was a profound sense of disappointment and surprise within Pimco regarding Mr. El-Erian's departure," the memo said, adding: "Mr. Gross viewed Mr. El-Erian as his successor and during the meeting he expressed a level of sadness and frustration regarding the resignation."

The Fresno systems were already weighing investing with Pimco when news of El-Erian's departure, as well as other staff changes, came out. When the city wanted reassurance on organizational questions, Pimco sent a team to the Fresno offices.

The Fresno systems are now negotiating with Pimco and expect to invest money with the firm in coming months.

"You're talking a lot of depth (of the bench). It's not driven by two people," said Stanley McDivitt, the systems' retirement administrator.

Other investors said they were not in a rush to make changes to their allocations.

The Florida State Board of Administration spokesman Dennis MacKee said it placed Pimco on its watch list as a routine procedure, which it followed for any firm that was undergoing management shifts.

The Florida board has about $1.7 billion in its pension fund at Pimco and about $240 million from its defined contribution plan with the firm.

"We think of our watch list as just enhanced oversight. You look a little deeper," MacKee said.

Neil Rue, a managing director at Pension Consulting Alliance, said it was too early to make any decisions about how these changes might affect Pimco's performance.

"On the fixed income front, we told our clients don't take any major action, but we need to watch this closely," Rue said.

If Pimco's style remains consistent, given Gross' strong track record over many years, there may be no changes recommended, Rue added.

R. T. Jones Capital Equities Management Inc Chief Investment Officer Steve Davis said his fund pulled out $100 million from Pimco Total Return Fund last year because of a desire to reduce duration exposure and interest rate risk, but he would consider returning to the bond giant in the future.

"Nor do we think the internal turmoil will negatively affect the performance of the fund. In fact, we don't rule out using the fund again in the future," Davis said. "We have very high respect for Bill Gross and his team at Pimco."

Photo credit: Bloomberg##821|Empty##822|Empty##823|Empty##824|Empty##825|KUALA LUMPUR/WASHINGTON – Satellites picked up faint electronic pulses from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 after it went missing on Saturday, but the signals gave no information about where the stray jet was heading and little else about its fate, two sources close to the investigation said on Thursday.

But the "pings" indicated its maintenance troubleshooting systems were switched on and ready to communicate with satellites, showing the aircraft, with 239 people on board, was at least capable of communicating after losing touch with air traffic controllers.

The system transmits such pings about once an hour, according to the sources, who said five or six were heard. However, the pings alone are not proof that the plane was in the air or on the ground, the sources said.

An international search for the 777, which left Kuala Lumpur early Saturday bound for Beijing, involves at least a dozen countries. Ships and aircraft are now combing a vast area that has been widened to cover the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea and on both sides of the Malay Peninsula.

The United States, which has sent ships and planes, said the search area may soon expand into the Indian Ocean, consistent with the theory that the plane may have detoured to the west about an hour after take-off from the Malaysian capital.

"It’s my understanding that based on some new information that’s not necessarily conclusive – but new information – an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington.

India’s defence ministry has already ordered the deployment of ships, aircraft and helicopters from the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 1,190 km (740 miles) east of Chennai, at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.

The Indian armed forces will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide how to coordinate their search efforts with other countries that are participating, a senior command officer said.

An Indian P8I Poseidon surveillance plane was sent to the Andaman islands on Thursday, ready to join the search once cleared, the head of India’s Andaman and Nicobar air force command, Air Marshal P.K Roy, said on Thursday.

The U.S. Navy was sending an advanced P-8A Poseidon to help search the Strait of Malacca, separating the Malay Peninsula from the Indonesian Island of Sumatra. It had already deployed a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft to those waters.

U.S. defense officials later told Reuters that the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, USS Kidd, was en route to Strait of Malacca, answering a request from the Malaysian government. The Kidd had been searching the areas south of the Gulf of Thailand, along with the destroyer USS Pinckney.

LITTLE FRESH LIGHT

The new information about signals heard by satellites shed little light on the mystery of what happened to the plane, whether it was a technical failure, a hijacking or another kind of incident on board.

While the troubleshooting systems were functioning, no data links were opened, the sources said, because the companies involved had not subscribed to that level of service from the satellite operator, the sources said.

Boeing Co, which made the missing 777 airliner, and Rolls-Royce, which supplied its Trent engines, declined to comment.

Earlier Malaysian officials denied reports that the aircraft had continued to send technical data and said there was no evidence that it flew for hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers early Saturday.

The Wall Street Journal had reported that U.S. aviation investigators and national security officials believed the Boeing 777 flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from its engines as part of a standard monitoring program.

Malaysian authorities have said the last civilian contact occurred as the Boeing 777-200ER flew north into the Gulf of Thailand. They said military radar sightings indicated the plane may have turned sharply to the west and crossed the Malay Peninsula toward the Andaman Sea.

It is one of the most baffling mysteries in the history of modern aviation – there has been no trace of the plane since nor any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of over a dozen countries across Southeast Asia.

"It’s extraordinary that with all the (satellite and telecommunication) technology that we’ve got that an aircraft can disappear like this," Tony Tyler, the head of the International Air Transport Association that links over 90 percent of the world’s airlines, told reporters in London.

WRONG IMAGES

On the sixth day of the search, planes scanned an area of sea where Chinese satellite images had shown what could be debris but found no sign of the airliner.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference the images were provided accidentally, saying the Chinese government neither authorised nor endorsed putting them on a website. "The image is not confirmed to be connected to the plane," he said.

It was the latest in a series of contradictory reports, adding to the confusion and agony of the relatives of the passengers, about two-thirds of whom were Chinese.

As frustration mounted over the failure to find any trace of the plane, China heaped pressure on Malaysia to improve coordination in the search.

Premier Li Keqiang, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, demanded that the "relevant party" step up coordination while China’s civil aviation chief said he wanted a "smoother" flow of information from Malaysia, which has come under heavy criticism for its handling of the disaster.

Indonesia and Thailand have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace.

Malaysian police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.

Two of the passengers on board were discovered by investigators to have false passports, but they were apparently seeking to emigrate illegally to the West.

The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 struck a seawall with its undercarriage on landing in San Francisco, killing three people.##826|You are using an older browser version.

"I can not confirm the time frame, but I can confirm that the preparatory work has begun," says Kosyanchich, quoted by RIA Novosti.



On Thursday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy stated about the results of an extraordinary EU summit that the EU could impose visa sanctions and freezing of assets on Russia, if in the next few days a dialogue between Russia and Ukraine do not begin. According to him, the relevant services of the EU will prepare proposals on sanctions in the near future. Council's statement does not say what group of Russian citizens could fall under EU sanctions.



Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier that the damage caused by possible sanctions in respect of the situation in Ukraine will be mutual, because in today's world everything is interconnected, and everyone depends on each other. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Russia expects understanding of the counter-productivity of possible imposition of unilateral sanctions against Moscow by Western countries.##830|##831|##832|Empty##833|##834|* Lenders to take control, hundreds of restaurants close * Sbarro hopes to emerge from bankruptcy before May 7 By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Pizza chain Sbarro LLC has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years after struggling with too much debt and fewer customers in malls that house many of its restaurants. Lenders would take control of the Melville, New York-based company under a "pre-packaged" Chapter 11 reorganization, which Sbarro on Monday said could allow it to made a "quick exit" from bankruptcy before May 7. Sbarro expects to cut its debt load by more than 80 percent, and said nearly all its lenders support its restructuring, which requires court approval. The company will invite other buyers to submit better offers. Founded in 1956, Sbarro had tried to boost sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor "fast casual" chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread. But an "unprecedented decline in mall traffic" and an "unsustainable" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of restaurants, Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing. "Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model," said Michael Whiteman, a restaurant consultant and president of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York. "Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order." The company said it recently closed more than 180 money-losing restaurants, and expects to shed about 50 more locations. It said it now has 799 restaurants in over 40 countries, employing more than 2,700 people. Sbarro said the bankruptcy does not affect the 582 restaurants owned by franchisees. Last month, the company announced plans to close 155 of its 400 company-owned restaurants in North America. Sbarro was founded in Brooklyn by Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro, a married couple who had immigrated from Naples, Italy. It expanded in the New York City area before launching in 1967 its typical restaurant format, which includes an open kitchen and lets customers serve themselves. NECESSARY STEP Sbarro and 33 affiliates filed for protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The company reported assets of $175.4 million and liabilities of $165.2 million. It plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization. Advisers include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Sbarro previously filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011, and emerged from Chapter 11 the following November. "The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step," Chief Executive David Karam said. Karam joined Sbarro last March from the hamburger chain Wendy's Co, where he was a president. Whiteman said Sbarro may face an uphill struggle. "I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term," he said. "The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing."

Sweet - Candy Crush Creator King Undervalued At $24 A Share

King Digital Entertainment, owner of the world���s most addictive video game, slapped a price range on its initial public offering Wednesday, and the bottom line was a lot lower than expected. The owner of Candy Crush Saga said it planned to sell 25.5 million shares at up to $24 each. With 315 million shares outstanding after the offering, that values the company at $7.6 billion. King brought in $1.9 billion of revenue and $568 million of profits last year. That���s $1.80 per share in profit, or a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of a whopping 13.3.##838|Stock markets in the Chinese mainland tumbled on Monday as investors absorbed weak economic data and news of the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines plane.

China's consumer price index (CPI) fell to a 13-month low of 2 percent in February, according to data released Sunday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Analysts saw the dip in the consumer price index as a sign of weakening consumer demand and continuing difficulties for enterprises.



The NBS data also showed an unexpected fall of 18.1 percent in China's exports in February, resulting in a trade deficit of $22.98 billion.



The yuan saw a sharp drop against the US dollar on Monday, falling by 111 basis points to 6.1312 yuan to the dollar, its weakest level this year.

State officials say the numbers came in as expected.

On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational marijuana to anyone age 21 or older. Cannabis purchases are limited to one ounce. It’s the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale.

Colorado places a 15% excise tax, a 10% special sales tax and a 2.9% sales tax on recreational marijuana, in addition to application and license fees. It imposes just a 2.9% sales tax, as well as application on license fees, on medical marijuana, which was legalized by voters in Colorado in 2000.

When combined with taxes and fees from medicinal marijuana, the state brought in a total of $3.5 million in January from pot sales.

The state also taxes alcohol, which brought in about $5.1 million in taxes in December, the most recent data available from the Colorado Department of Revenue.

A big chunk of the funds collected from marijuana taxes will be funneled to programs aimed at keeping kids way from pot. The governor has requested funds for the prevention of youth marijuana, for treatment of substance use, regulatory oversight, and law enforcement and public safety.##840|##841|##842|Empty##843|(ANSAmed) - TRIPOLI - A tanker flying a North Korean flag, docked illegally at the Libyan port of Sidra with a load of crude oil for export on behalf of a separatist group, eluded the Tripoli escort keeping it under check and took off, said a member of Libya's General National Congress (GNC).

The same parliamentary source said the North Korean oil tanker Morning Glory is now in international waters. The tanker distanced itself after illegally loading crude on behalf of a separatist group from eastern Libya.

The event, however, continues to remain shrouded in confusion. Libyan authorities last night declared that they took control of the ship after a brief armed clash with rebels who control the port, while the 33-year-old leader of the separatist group, Ibrahiml Jadran, immediately denied the government's declarations. Jadran, who appeared last night on television aboard a ship - said to be the Morning Glory - showed himself determined to export the oil independently of Tripoli and on behalf of Cirenaica, while respecting international obligations.

He also responded to recent declarations by the American ambassador to Tripoli, Deborah Jones, according to whom only Libya's national oil company has the right to sell the country's oil. "These declarations are illegal. We exercise our rights and we will continue to sell crude," the young leader thundered. (ANSAmed).##844|WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.

The tenets of the plan – which could expand to include the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations – are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.

But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with members outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility and Peace of Mind.” with suggestions on how to talk about it with constituents.

Republicans have campaigned heavily on their opposition to the health care law. Those efforts accelerated last week after Republican David Jolly’s upset victory in a special House election in Florida in which the campaigns focused on the law.

Democrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture, saying the focus on long-held conservative ideas was more of an attempt to rally Republicans than to find bipartisan solutions.

Share##845|How much will Candy Crush creator King be worth when it goes public this month? As much as $7.6 billion, according to initial public offering (IPO) documents filed today with the Securities & Exchange Commission. The company, which will be traded as "KING", said today that it will price its IPO of 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 each.

After the IPO, King will have 314.9 million shares outstanding for a top valuation of around $7.6 billion.

You'll be able to buy shares in King on March 26, two underwriters told Reuters today. King will sell 15.5 million shares through the offering, while stockholders will sell 6.7 million.

King could be considered a risky investment. The social game studio has a massive audience of 128 million daily active users and over 1.2 billion daily game sessions, but Candy Crush Saga makes up 93 million of those daily users and accounts for 1.085 billion of those games.

King has made headlines so far in 2014 for its staunch stance on intellectual property (IP). Last month, King responded to the recent wave of criticisms lodged against the company concerning its trademark request for the word "Candy," its opposition to The Banner Saga, and one indie developer's claim that they stole his game. The developer of CandySwipe has since come out to deride King for trying to revoke his trademark.##846|Empty##847|Empty##848|##849|The numbers were not as high as expected, but are still well in the black, as Colorado announced the revenues raised from its first month of legal recreational marijuana sales.

According to data released Monday by the state's Department of Revenue, Colorado brought in more than $2 million in taxes on sales from recreational cannabis in January. That number includes over $1.4 million from a 10 percent retail marijuana state tax, plus nearly $417,000 collected as part of the state's regular 2.9 percent sales tax. Roughly $195,000 was collected for the month through a 15 percent retail marijuana excise tax, with the proceeds going toward the construction of public schools in the state.



Total taxes, licenses and fees for January for sales of both medicinal and recreational marijuana in Colorado came to over $3.5 million.

Those figures, meanwhile, are reportedly below earlier estimates for recreational sales in Colorado.

Twenty states, along with Washington, D.C., have legalized medical marijuana, with voters in Colorado and Washington state voting in 2012 to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults. Consumers in Colorado started purchasing recreational cannibis on Jan. 1, and recreational sales in Washington are expected to start later this year.

Cannabis advocates say the Colorado data prove the marijuana's industry's viability as a legal source of tax revenue. "The month of January showed the world that taking marijuana off the streets and putting it behind a taxed, regulated counter can be done professionally, productively and prosperously," Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, said in a statement.

"Now it's time for Congress to reconcile outdated federal laws with those of states like Colorado." he added, "that have decided to opt out of the failed experiment of marijuana prohibition."

A group of cannabis industry advocates is scheduled to meet congressional representatives from California, Oregon and Colorado on Capitol Hill Thursday to discuss banking and taxation issues.

This year could end up being pivotal for marijuana laws and regulations in the U.S. According to NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, nearly 30 states and the District of Columbia are considering legislation this year to reform their cannabis laws.



Of that number, 14 states are reportedly mulling marijuana legalization. As a result, state officials are closely watching Colorado, as it breaks new ground in generating cannabis-based tax revenue.

"Colorado's going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn't," Pat Oglesby, a former staffer with the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, told The Associated Press. Oglesby is also the founder of the Center for New Revenue, a North Carolina-based non-profit that is researching the potential of marijuana-related taxes.##850|Vodafone is in the spotlight Monday after announcing that it has reached an agreement with shareholders of Ono to buy the Spanish cable company for €7.2 billion ($10 billion), including debt.##851|Chiquita has combined with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company.

The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion US in annual sales. The merged company, ChiquitaFyffesPLC, will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of the combined operation.

The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.

Fyffes shares up 46%

Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66 US).

Fyffes rose 46 per cent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 per cent to $12.20 in New York.

Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.

Fyffes chairman David McCann will become chief executive officer of the combined company while the chief executive of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.

Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."

However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita, which has a big presence in the or Fyffes, a major presence in Europe, aren't expected to notice any difference. The two brands are staying separate.##852|One of the big market stories of the weekend/week: The Chinese Yuan weakened again after China announced over the weekend that it would widen the "band" in which the currency was allowed to trade. Basically, the government sets a midpoint price, and now there's a 2% band around that price around which the market can move the value of the currency. Previously the band was set at 1%.

Chinese investors marked an important milestone last week when they rejected a bond offer by Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Development Co, one of the nation's leading hotel operators, reflecting their growing understanding of risk in China's young financial markets. Chinese investors often blindly pile into nearly any product offered by the latest hot company, bank, fund manager or Internet firm, falsely believing they are guaranteed big returns on their money.



But as several recent cases show, big returns are never guaranteed and sometimes investors can even lose all their money on the riskiest products. More sophisticated Western investors are already well-aware of these risks, and seldom complain when high-yield products sometimes fail to deliver promised returns. Central authorities in China need to accelerate efforts to educate Chinese investors about these risks, both through better disclosures and also by letting financial products occasionally fail to teach buyers that no investment is risk-free.



Jin Jiang first announced its plan to raise up to 1.6 billion yuan ($260 million) through a corporate bond issue in June, to help fund its expansion at home and also as it seeks to become China's first major hotel brand to go abroad. In January, the company made a tentative first step outside its home market when it formed a partnership with a local company to enter Indonesia.



Jin Jiang received necessary approvals to raise the funds, a relatively large sum for a company of its size and also a relatively risky bet due to its dependence on the volatile hotel market to repay the money. But after conducting a roadshow to test market sentiment, Jin Jiang announced late last week it decided to scrap the offer due to "economic conditions" - a veiled way of saying that investors weren't interested in the bonds.



In the past, domestic investors almost certainly would have given a company like Jin Jiang as much money as it wanted regardless of the return rate. That willingness was based on the underlying assumption that such bonds were risk-free, because either a State-run parent or local government entity would assist with repayment if the company ever ran into financial difficulties. But rejection of the Jin Jiang bond shows investors increasingly realizing they must be responsible for their own decisions, and that they can't depend on State bailouts when problems emerge.



Another group of wealthy private investors ran into similar problems last year when a product sold through Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China's largest commercial bank, defaulted on its promise of high returns. In that case, the product was backed by a Shanxi coal mining company that ultimately failed, resulting in the default. But investors complained that they should have been protected from any risk since ICBC marketed the product.



An unnamed third party, almost certainly acting under government orders, ultimately stepped in to repay the debt and end the controversy. But even then the investors - who should have lost everything - weren't satisfied, saying they deserved not only to get their money back but also to receive the promised high rate of return. When such defaults happen in the West, buyers often consider themselves lucky to recoup as little as 10 to 20 percent of their original investment.



Just last week, Chinese investors got another lesson in risk when solar panel maker Chaori Solar failed to make an interest payment for a domestic bond, becoming the first-ever such default since Chinese authorities first implemented market reforms 25 years ago. The company is just one of many solar firms facing such difficulty, following a two-year downturn for the sector due to construction of massive overcapacity in China. It's still unclear what will happen in that instance, though so far no government entity has come forward to say it will help cover Chaori's 90 million yuan shortfall.



Central authorities should resist any urge to come to Chaori's rescue, and also the pressure it is feeling to placate investors in the ICBC case. It should also encourage widespread publicizing of the two cases to show investors they need to take responsibility for all their decisions, including putting money into the many new Internet investment products now springing up such as Yu'ebao.



Regulators should also launch a broader campaign to require better disclosure by issuers of these investment products, which often boast high rates of return and hide the risk potential in the fine print. Such a two-pronged approach will benefit not only investors but also the entire Chinese financial sector by building trust and accountability throughout the system.

China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

“We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,” said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York.

“I don't think it's disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome.”

Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.4 percent.

Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P's 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.

“That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?” said Kenny.

In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672.

McDonald's Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.

Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company's newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe's largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world's biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42.

That pattern was set in Asia, where markets took a break from recent volatile trading but struggled to do much more than make incremental moves. US stock index futures and benchmark debt were also flat ahead of the Wall Street open.

World shares and the euro zone’s blue-chip EURO STOXX 50 were both down 0.1 per cent after hovering near the previous day’s close for most of the morning, unable to match the marginal gains seen in Asia.

“Market players remain cautious. There’s a lack of enthusiasm in chasing stocks, and some are just thinking about moving to the sidelines after the roller-coaster ride we’ve had since the start of the year,” said Guillaume Dumans, co-head of research firm 2Bremans.

The standout gainer across European indexes was Portugal’s PSI 20, which rose 0.8 per cent for a gain close to its three-year intraday high, as debt yields in the country dropped to their lowest since April 10 on optimism the country can exit its international bailout programme later this year.

Strong trade data from Germany, the region’s economic powerhouse, helped the country’s DAX index outperform.

But gains were pared by late morning and safe-haven German debt edged off its lows on Ukraine concerns, with Bund futures at 142.64.

“Recent events, especially concerning Russia and Turkey, have made the outlook less certain, and their impact will only be felt in a few months from now,” said Markus Huber, a senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black.

Tensions over Ukraine continued to build on Tuesday. With diplomacy at a standstill, Ukraine’s acting president announced the formation of a volunteer national guard, while ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich insisted he remained the country’s legitimate leader.

Turkish assets have been hit by political scandals and a power struggle between Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and a US-based Muslim cleric.

The euro began the day on a lacklustre note and later extended its dip to be down 0.2 per cent against the dollar after a leading central banker reminded the market that the European Central Bank was in accommodative mode.

Elsewhere, a safe-haven bid for the yen kept it flat, even after comments from Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda that there was no need to adjust Japanese monetary policy for now.

“Dollar/yen has been in a range between 101-104 yen for much of this year and the yen needs a fresh trigger for the next leg of weakness,” said Peter Kinsella, currency strategist at Commerzbank. “That could come from a steady deterioration in Japan’s trade and current account deficits.” Against a basket of currencies, the US dollar edged higher by late morning to trade up 0.1 per cent.

After recent major ructions in metals markets following February’s drop in Chinese exports, prices for industrial commodities bounced off recent lows but trade remained cautious.

Dealers in Asia remained especially nervous about iron ore, however, following an 8 per cent slide on Monday that fuelled unease about the health of China’s giant steel sector.

Both gold and crude oil extended early gains as Ukraine strengthened the bid in both markets and kept them near intraday highs.

Brent crude, Europe’s regional benchmark, gained 49 cents to $108.57 a barrel, while gains for US oil were more measured, ahead 28 cents. Both reversed a slight weakness during the Asian day.

Gold, meanwhile, was at $1,349 (Dh4,954) an ounce. In a sign of the recent jump in demand, the world’s biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday.

“Gold continues to be largely supported above $1,329, and while prices are unlikely to break above $1,361.60 in the absence of war, underlying support from the Ukrainian crisis ... is likely to keep prices elevated above $1,320 for an extended time,” said Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures.##860|You may have read about it, you may have heard it on the news, or seen it on Facebook.

But believe me, nothing prepares you for Grandma cookies baked in "cannabutter," the pot smokers' smoking bus tour, the world of "vaping" (a soccer mom favourite, apparently) and the marijuana-infused chocolate dips, bath salts, sodas and, yes, sour patch gummy bears. All are part of Denver's ode to pot.

Denver now has more marijuana stores than Starbucks coffee shops.

Watch Joyce Napier's documentary on Colorado's experiment with legalized marijuana tonight on The National.

Since New Year's Day, when marijuana was legalized in Colorado, this city has seemed to exist outside of America.

Colorado took the jump — the first of two states, Washington the other, to legalize recreational marijuana — the debate is now over.

It's the new reality here: highly (pardon me) regulated, and surprisingly disciplined, and it seems to be working just fine, for now.

Colorado marijuana growers and sellers, who could only cater to medical marijuana users before Jan. 1, can now sell to anyone 21 years and over with a valid ID.

Residents can buy one ounce at a time, visitors are limited to a quarter ounce. All products are imprinted with bar codes, and are electronically traceable.

Don't try to smoke it in a public place, you'll get a fine.

And no, you can't take it with you when you leave the state. All the marijuana has to be grown, sold and bought in Colorado.

The green rush

The new law is manna for people like Toni Fox, owner of the 3D Cannabis Centre.

She made $1,000 a day in sales when she was catering to medical marijuana users. Now that she's gone recreational, she believes that by the fall, she'll be making $100,000 a day.

The new gold rush in Colorado is decidedly green.

That first day drew huge lineups, three hours long, at dispensaries — like the ones at Apple stores on the day a new iPhone comes out.

No one whined. Many of those waiting in line that freezing Colorado winter morning — a dry cold, as they say here — were going to buy legal pot for the first time in their lives. The excitement kept them warm

That same excitement, and the thrill of not having to hide your pot away, is attracting many Americans to Denver nowadays, a kind of spillover tourist boom.

(Sylvain Richard, SRC)

Matt Brown is the co-founder of My 4/20 Tours, "the first legal marijuana tourism company in North America." He has thousands on his waiting list, he says.

He gets clients like Mauricio and Kim, from El Paso, Tex. They came to Denver for a total marijuana weekend. Pot à gogo, without the guilt trip. They even get to attend a marijuana cooking class.

"It's like being in Amsterdam without having to take a plane," Mauricio says.

Pot tourists can eat it, smoke it, drink it, chew it, bathe in it, inhale it from a battery-powered vaporizer, and even rub it in.

They can visit grow-ops and dispensaries where jars of marijuana are neatly arranged by strains.

Try the candies

In Denver, you can buy some "Juicy Fruit" and "Purple Kush" and "Gigabud" as well as all sorts of spreadables, chewables and edibles. That's where the money is.

Smoking is out. Denver has a Clean Air Act that forbids smoking in public places, and that includes joints, of course. So eating marijuana-laced cookies, cakes and candies is the thing now.

Back at Love's Oven, for instance, one of many budding marijuana bakeries, business is up more than 1,000 per cent. Hope, the executive chef, can't bake them fast enough.

Her best-seller? The ginger cookie that "will make you happy for a long time."

Yesterday's pushers are today's marijuana entrepreneurs: promoters, sellers growers and bakers. You can find them sipping martinis on a Friday evening at the casually chic Space Gallery for a "Threesome with Mary Jane" soirée, at $120 a pop for food, open bar and a nearby limo bus to smoke your pot.

It's a new world. It is also a big social issue and so it has become a specialty beat for the Denver Post. The state's largest daily now has a website dedicated to marijuana, The Cannabist, with its own editor in chief and pot critics.

The Colorado experiment, as it's called, looks to be quite the success so far. The state might even make as much as $150 million this year in marijuana taxes (almost double previous estimates). Much of that money will be by law reinvested in schools and education.

It's early days, of course, but there has been no reported increase in crime or traffic accidents.

One imponderable, though: how to test for driving under the influence of marijuana?

And then there is the banking issue.

Banks are still nervous about accepting drug profits — it's still a crime federally here in the U.S. — although Washington has said it won't prosecute in states where pot is legal.

Many dispensaries store their money in safes. But one can bet that, as profits grow, banks will happily join the green rush.##861|COLORADO made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalised pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 per cent sales taxes and 15 per cent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.

Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about how to spend the windfall.

Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.

Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, who serves on Colorado's budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.##862|The January JOLTS report is out.

Job openings came in at 3.974 million, below the 4.015 million expected but up from December's revised print of 3.914 million.

The hire rate and separation rate were basically unchanged at 3.3% and 3.2%, respectively.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' "JOLTS Report" may not be as market moving as monthly nonfarm payrolls, but it does gives key insights into the labor market on hires, quits, layoffs, and job openings.

In fact, the Federal Reserve's new chair Janet Yellen has cited JOLTS as one of her favorite reports. As the unemployment rate edges toward the Fed's targets over the next few years, JOLTS could possibly play a larger role when the central bank determines interest rate policy.##863|The maker of the hugely-popular mobile game Candy Crush Saga is looking for sweet returns from its initial public offering expected later this month. King Digital Entertainment expects to be worth $7.6 billion based on a share price between $21 and $24 dollars. The company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker: KING.

The Irish company is hoping to capitalize on a hot IPO market so far this year and momentum from recent offerings such as Twitter and Facebook, both of which have seen strong gains since their debuts.

Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Aaron Task told Hot Stock Minute this morning that his initial reaction to the planned IPO and the valuation was that the market was getting way ahead of itself, but on closer inspection the valuation is not that high relative to the overall market and technology stocks, in particular. “Think about the valuation on WhatsApp at $19 billion with no revenue?” asked Task. “King Entertainment is a profitable company. They had about $2 billion in revenue last year.”

Candy Crush Saga, which was the most-downloaded free app of 2013, requires players to line up candies of the same color. The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012.

Task believes the IPO price range is a vote of confidence from Wall Street based on Candy Crush and some of King’s smaller hits, but he says the valuation also means Wall Street wants to see what’s next in the pipeline. “It doesn’t seem like a crazy valuation, at least on the surface,” said Task. “I think people who get in on the IPO are going to be very happy on the first day of trading.”

The offering is scheduled to be priced on March 25th and the stock will start trading on March 26th, according to Reuters’ sources.##864|Health & Wellness is written by Amy Osmond Cook and Greg Osmond.

Satellite data showed that the plane likely flew either on that route or northwest toward Kazakhstan. The latter seems less likely since the plane would have flown through the airspace of multiple countries.

Experts agree that there’s a good chance MH370 will never be found if it’s gone into a deep and remote part of the Indian Ocean.

Australia today took charge of the search in the Indian Ocean.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament Australia would coordinate operations in the vast search area to its west.

Mr Abbott spoke to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak today. “I offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted,” he said.

Defence Force chief General David Hurley had been in touch with his Malaysian counterpart to discuss how additional resources could be used.

Australia has two P-3 Orion surveillance planes on the search and are reportedly looking around the Cocos islands about 2,000 nautical miles northwest of Perth.

Mr Abbott said: “We will do our duty to ensure that our search and rescue responsibilities are maintained and upheld and we will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery.”##866|Empty##867|Bloomberg News

The nutrition and supplement company’s shares plunged more than 12 percent following a brief halt in trading pending the announcement.

Herbalife said that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to elaborate. The FTC’s website says that these are used to investigate possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The company, which has faced accusations of operating a pyramid scheme, said that it welcomes the inquiry given “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business.

Herbalife says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully. The company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Los Angeles, uses a network of distributors to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products globally.

The FTC inquiry comes just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company.

Ackman has bet against the company and said repeatedly that he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme, which is when a company makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products that they sell.

On Tuesday, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management resumed this effort Tuesday, holding a public event to detail his firm’s claims of how its Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme in China, violating laws there.

Herbalife has repeatedly denied the claims and rival investor Carl Icahn has disagreed as well, taking his fight against Ackman public and increasing his stake in the company.

Its shares fell $5.57, or 8.5 percent, to $59.92 in mid-afternoon, but fell as low as $54.59 earlier. Its shares had fallen almost 17 percent so far this year through Tuesday’s close.##869|While we are not fully apprised of the facts in the decision to eliminate respiratory therapists from some of your care settings, we do have concerns about the competency and proficiency of others who may be called upon to replace those respiratory therapists.

In testimony to the Treasury Committee, he said the Monetary Policy Committee ranged in the February Inflation Report that spare capacity was 1-1.5 percent.

"I personally would be at the upper end of that range and I would add that the margin, given the most recent employment report that we are probably slightly higher than that 1.5 percent," Carney told lawmakers.

However, policymaker Martin Weale said the slack in the economy is overstated.

Any unwinding of quantitative easing should occur after several adjustments in interest rates, Carney said. He said it is not unreasonable to raise rate to 2 percent to 2.5 percent over the next three years.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and the S&P500 (SPY) posted gains for the week as Friday’s employment report exceeded expectations and Ukraine stayed on the back burner.

For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gained 0.8%, the SP500 (SPY) added 1% and the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.7%.

The week was choppy as markets reacted to the situation in Ukraine and also hit new highs.

Economic reports were mostly positive as U.S. PMI registered 57.1 and exceeded expectations and initial jobless claims posted 323,000 versus expectations of 335,000 and last week’s 349,000.

February ISM was also well received at 53.2% compared to expected of 52.5% and last month’s 51.3%.

The big news of the week was the conflict with Russia in Ukraine and Russia’s stock market (RSX) fell approximately 12% for the week.

This coming week brings NFIB small business index on Tuesday, Thursday sees weekly jobless claims, February retail sales, and Friday reveals producer prices and University of Michigan consumer sentiment.

Other factors at work next week will be:

1. Ongoing concern over margin debt which is at record highs and which usually peaks near stock market highs.

2. The bull market’s fifth birthday last month which makes this a longer than average bull run.

3. New concern voiced by Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher, a new voting member and hawk, suggesting that the Fed needed to watch for stock market bubbles and new irrational exuberance.

4. Excessive valuations, now comparable to levels seen at the 2007 peak.

A quick glance at the chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reveals that the market is close to overbought levels and approaching significant resistance.

Dow Jones Industrials Daily

Bottom line: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and other major indexes continue to climb while valuations and margin debt flash warnings.

Carney: RBS may have to move HQ to England if Scots vote for independence

Royal Bank of Scotland may have to move its headquarters to England if Scotland votes for independence this year, the Bank of England's governor has told MPs.

"It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it. It depends on their arrangements as well," Mark Carney told the Treasury select committee on Tuesday.

He was referring to a EU rule that requires banks to be based in the same country as most of their business. For RBS, which also owns NatWest and a London-based investment bank, that is England.

The rule would apply if, as expected, an independent Scotland joined the EU. Carney said RBS also had the option of refocusing its business on Scotland.

Carney said an independent Scotland would have to guarantee deposits held in England by Scottish-domiciled banks under EU law.

Since the insurer Standard Life revealed last month it was working on contingency plans to leave Scotland, more attention has focused on what banks and other businesses would do if Scotland voted for independence in September's referendum.

Scotland has the biggest financial services industry in the UK outside London. Banks, insurers and other financial companies employ about 150,000 people in the country.

Carney has tried to stay neutral in the political debate about Scottish independence and has said he instead wants to provide analysis on how a monetary and banking union between Scotland and the rest of Britain might work. RBS has also tried to keep out of the matter, saying it is for the Scottish people to decide.

Carney told MPs that the Bank of England would provide "clear and public advice" on any risks if Scottish independence results in a monetary agreement with the rest of Britain.##874|BANK of England governor Mark Carney will today face his toughest public testimony to date as he seeks to defend the integrity of an institution that's become embroiled in the currency-manipulation scandal.

BANK of England governor Mark Carney will today face his toughest public testimony to date as he seeks to defend the integrity of an institution that's become embroiled in the currency-manipulation scandal.

MPs will grill Mr Carney after the BOE suspended an employee and released minutes of meetings showing officials knew of concerns the foreign-exchange market was being rigged almost eight years ago. The central bank said last week that an internal review had found no evidence so far that staff were involved in collusion.

The controversy marks a major test of Mr Carney's leadership after he took over the BOE less than a year ago and began overhauling its monetary policy, communications regime and structure. It's the second rigging scandal to hit the central bank following its entanglement in 2012 in the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate. Lawmakers criticised how it handled that affair, calling it naive. "The statement on the internal review is only an early staging post in what is likely to develop into a very significant issue," said Simon Hart, a lawyer at RPC LLP in London. "The statement left open as many questions as it answered. It was noticeably silent on what the bank knew about other FX market participants."

Mr Carney, along with Markets Director Paul Fisher, is due to appear before Parliament's cross-party Treasury Committee at noon in London to answer questions on the foreign-exchange inquiry and the central bank's governance. That session will follow hearings on the BOE's inflation report and Scottish independence.

The testimony comes as regulators investigate allegations that traders at the world's largest banks worked together to rig the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether currency traders distorted prices for options and exchange-traded funds by rigging benchmark currency rates, sources told Bloomberg.

More than 20 traders from banks, including Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Barclays, the three biggest currency traders, have been fired, suspended or put on leave since Bloomberg first reported in June that dealers said they shared information about client orders to manipulate foreign-exchange benchmark rates.

The suspended BOE employee, who hasn't been named, is being investigated and "no decision has been taken on disciplinary action", the central bank said last week. According to minutes of meetings released alongside that statement, BOE officials knew of concerns the foreign-exchange market was being manipulated as early as July 2006, more than seven years before regulators opened formal probes. The minutes also show BOE officials discussed with traders concerns that currency benchmarks were being manipulated. Foreign-exchange benchmarks are used to compute the day-to-day value of holdings – and by index providers.

Libyan gunmen demanding regional autonomy and a share of oil wealth managed to load crude onto the ship, which escaped Libya's navy.

The case embarrassed Tripoli's government and prompted parliament to sack the prime minister.

US Navy commandos stormed the Morning Glory tanker as it sat in international waters off Cyprus last night.

They took control of the vessel, which the Pentagon said had been held by three armed Libyans.

The standoff over control of OPEC member Libya's oil illustrates how fragile the North African nation's stability remains since the NATO-backed civil war that led to the fall of Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.

A weak government has been unable to impose its will on former anti-Gaddafi fighters, while militias now use their military muscle to make demands on the state and often target the vital oil sector.

The tanker's seizure by US forces is likely to prevent any more attempted oil sales by the rebels.

In August, rebels took control of three export terminals accounting previously for 700,000 barrels a day of exports.

"Oil is the economy's artery. The government will not allow anyone to fool around with the assets and resources of the Libyan people," the Libyan government said in a statement.

No one was hurt in the tanker raid, which was approved by US President Barack Obama and requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained" from the Libyan port of Es Sider, his statement said.

It was the second time in six months that US forces have become involved in Libya.

A commando team snatched a suspected al-Qaeda suspect off the street as he returned home from prayers in the capital Tripoli in September.

The Cypriot foreign ministry said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a US military escort.

It was parked 29km southwest of Cyprus when the operation occurred around midnight Cyprus time.

The Morning Glory had been North Korean-flagged, but the government in Pyongyang on Thursday said it had notified Libya and maritime authorities that it had severed all ties with the ship because of the vessel's contraband cargo.

Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said on Saturday his group was ready to negotiate an end to the port blockade, but the government needed to abandon plans to mount a military offensive.

Libya's parliament head, who has quasi-presidential powers, had given the rebels two weeks to withdraw from the seized ports or face a military operation.

But analysts said it was uncertain whether government troops would be able effectively to confront the heavily armed rebels, made up of soldiers who defected from an oil protection force.##878|Oh no! Page not found

This article was published 12/3/2014 (1664 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Satellite images on a Chinese government website may show debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating a few days ago off the southern tip of Vietnam near the plane's original flight path, China's Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.

The revelation could provide searchers with a focus that has eluded them since the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard just hours after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday. Since then, the search has covered 92,600 square kilometres, first east and then west of Malaysia and even expanded toward India on Wednesday.

The Chinese sighting, if confirmed, would be closer to where the frantic hunt started.

The Xinhua report said the images from around 11 a.m. Sunday appear to show "three suspected floating objects" of varying sizes in a 20-kilometre radius, the largest about 24 by 22 metres.##880|Bloomberg

J.C. Penney Co., an American comeback story?

Yes, said Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on Tuesday and raised his price target to $11 from $7.50. The move sent Penney shares up as much as 10.2% in early trading.

Chen said the company may be successful in getting back the shoppers lost during former CEO Ron Johnson’s failed reign. Penney has brought back its key private-label products including St. John’s Bay, Worthington and Ambrielle taken out under Johnson as Chief Executive Mike Ullman has said he aims to increase store brands, which are more profitable than national brands, to a level of about 50% of sales from 30% under Johnson. Meanwhile, a better assortment of national labels including Levi’s, Nike and Carter’s also are helping to bring customers back, the analyst noted.

He also applauded the company’s /quotes/zigman/237947/delayed /quotes/nls/jcp JCP “taking the pain now to go narrow and deep” with its move to remove merchandise including Justin Timberlake’s William Rast label as well as JCP Everyday, the home furnishings line designed by home maven Martha Stewart /quotes/zigman/250056/delayed /quotes/nls/mso MSO that had been at the center of controversy with Penney’s key rival Macy’s Inc. /quotes/zigman/467976/delayed /quotes/nls/m M . While exiting those merchandise has hurt gross margin in the fourth quarter, Chen said he doesn’t expect discontinued labels to continue to hurt first-quarter margin. He sees “significant” improvement in margin this year.

Meanwhile, the company’s home merchandise, the worst performing section under Johnson that had declined to 12% of sales in 2012 from nearly 20% in 2008, may also get a boost as Penney overhauls the segment. The analyst said merchandising changes in the kids’ department also will be a boost.

Penney “isn’t taking substantial fashion risk but just going back to what worked before and marketing to drive prudent traffic,” Chen said, adding investors’ fears on the company’s liquidity position “are overdone.” He said he sees the company to end the year with $2 billion liquidity, in line with company projection. “Achieving (first quarter) and (fiscal year) guidance will mitigate investor fear on liquidity concerns and drive profitability and the stock higher.”

SHFE copper cathode stocks have been rising steadily since January 10, surging 70% from 122,189 mt at the time.

The SHFE warehouses are located in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Guangdong. They have a combined capacity to store 1.13 million mt of copper cathode, according to information on the SHFE website.

Chinese industry analysts attributed the growing stockpiles to weak domestic consumption, pointing out that product from warehouses in the US and Europe were being shipped to China.



"Copper inventories at overseas warehouses have been falling as they have been sent to China," Yang Jinjian, a commodity analyst with Northern Futures, said Monday.

"Current copper consumption in China isn't good. We expect that by end March or early April, market players in the domestic downstream copper processing will start buying. But their purchase volume would be limited as they set their buying plans based on their products output, which is not so good," he said.

March-June is the peak buying season for copper cathode in China, during which the downstream copper processing sector typically replenishes stock.

Jack Yeung, a business professor at Hong Kong's City University, said: "Copper inventories at both Comex and London Metal Exchange warehouses have been falling in the past weeks, so contributing to the growing SHFE stocks."

Chinese industry observers also pointed to a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and tighter monetary policy which has spurred some state-owned enterprises to turn to collateralized borrowing, using copper as collateral.

"Some of the loans are granted by non-bank financial companies, owing to the government's tightening on banks' lending. If this kind of shadow banking collapses in future, we don't rule out that copper inventories in China could keep growing," he said.

In a commodity report issued Friday, Chinese metals consultancy Beijing Antaike said that copper trading companies were apathetic in trading, with consumption by the downstream copper processing sector remaining lackluster for the whole week.

LATEST UPDATES:

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Officials revealed a new timeline Monday suggesting the final voice transmission from the cockpit of the missing Malaysian plane may have occurred before any of its communications systems were disabled, adding more uncertainty about who aboard might have been to blame.

New timeline casts doubt on theory of pilots’ deception

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight’s last words — “All right, good night” — to ground controllers.

Malaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner’s data communications systems — the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System — had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.

However, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS — which gives plane performance and maintenance information — came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.

The new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane’s transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.

Turning off a transponder is easy and, in rare instances, there may be good reason to do so in flight – for example, if it were reporting incorrect data.

Malaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot’s home on Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot in what Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar initially said was the first police visits to those homes. However, the government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying police first visited the pilots’ homes as early as March 9, the day after the flight.

Plane ‘purposely diverted from its flight path’

Malaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was intentionally diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8. Suspicion has fallen on the pilots because of their aviation experience, although Malaysian officials have said they are seeking background checks on everyone aboard the flight.

Investigators haven’t ruled out hijacking, sabotage, pilot suicide or mass murder, and they are checking the backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.

However, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Monday that finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out finding it intact.

“The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,” Hishammuddin said.

French investigators arriving in Kuala Lumpur to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals. But that vital tool is missing in the Malaysia Airlines mystery because flight 370’s communications were deliberately severed ahead of its disappearance more than a week ago, investigators say.

“It’s very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult,” said Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France’s aviation accident investigation bureau.

Malaysia seeks helps from 26 countries

Malaysia’s government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

Over the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 1/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Australia leads search efforts

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the “ill-fated aircraft” during a conversation Monday with Malaysia’s leader.

“Australia will do its duty in this matter,” Abbott told parliament. “We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery.”

Australia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world’s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

Search area expands

Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.

The northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan – all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.

An official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defence Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately respond to questions on radar information.

Indonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country’s search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.

Searchers relying on a type of satellite data never used before to find missing plane

Finding a missing Malaysia Airlines plane may hinge on whether searchers can narrow down where they need to look using satellite data that is inexact and has never been used for that purpose before, search and rescue experts say.

Based on the hourly connections with the plane, described by a U.S. official as a “handshake,” the satellite knows at what angle to tilt its antenna to be ready to receive a message from the plane should one be sent. Using that antenna angle, along with radar data, investigators have been able to draw two vast arcs, or “corridors” – a northern one from northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. The plane is believed to be somewhere along those arcs.

Air crash investigators have never used this kind of satellite data before to try to find a missing plane, but after pursing other leads it’s the best clue left.##884|If you change your mind, here's how to allow notifications:

Coutts holds 3% to 4% gold in its portfolios, up from 1% to 2% last year, said Gary Dugan, chief investment officer for Asia and the Middle East. Coutts had £29.7bn ($49.45bn, €35.7bn) of assets under management as of December 2013.

A price of about $1,250 an ounce would be a good entry point, said Dugan.

Spot gold shed 0.4% to $1,334.50 an ounce at 10:35GMT, while US gold futures for delivery in April dropped $3.20 an ounce to $1,335.00.

Coutts' outlook contradicts speculation from Goldman Sachs and Westpac Banking that bullion would decline this year.

Genuine Gold Demand

"There's a real robustness to physical demand and the spark that we got from Ukraine took us to a spike. But even before that, there was genuine demand from our clients to diversify their wealth into a greater fraction to gold," said Dugan.

"I still think there are tension points around the world," he said, highlighting Ukraine as well as strained relations between China and Japan. "Because it's an insurance policy, you try and buy it cheap, you don't ever rush in."

"Jewellery demand clearly shows the Chinese love affair for gold. There was nothing exceptional last year about the Chinese economy to suggest there was a substantial over-demand," Dugan added.

"The idea that you make an extraordinary gain from gold has changed. Many people have gone back to thinking of it as a store of value," Dugan told Bloomberg on 5 March.

Ukraine Crisis

Gold prices jumped to a four-month high of $1,354.87 on 3 March as fears about a probable conflict between Russia and Ukraine boosted the yellow metal's safe-haven investment allure.

Prices rose amid news that China has backed Russia in the tense standoff with the US and Europe that has erupted following the pro-West revolution in Ukraine.

Last month, gold logged the first back-to-back monthly increase since August 2013.

Demand in China would be sustained as incomes rise, supporting prices, according to Credit Agricole's private-banking unit. The market has not yet understood the scale of annual Chinese buying, Davis Hall, global head of foreign exchange and precious metals advisory, said on 24 February.

While gold was a favourite asset to bet against or ignore over the past year, that's no longer the case, UBS AG analysts Edel Tully and Joni Teves said on 19 February. They raised their 2014 forecast to $1,300 an ounce from $1,200 an ounce.

Gold will end the year at $1,050 an ounce, Goldman Sachs analysts stated in a 12 February report. Westpac's Justin Smirk, the second most-accurate forecaster tracked by Bloomberg over the past two years, forecast lower prices against the backdrop of a recovering US economy and a stronger dollar.

Gold bounced back this year as rising consumption in Asia and emerging-market tumult boosted demand.

China surpassed India as the world's largest gold consumer in 2013 as demand expanded 32%, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Consumption in the world's second-largest economy rose to 1,065.8 metric tons in 2013, WGC data showed.

In May 2013, Dugan said a return to gold's peak was not likely. Prices crashed 28% last year.

In August 2012, Dugan forecast bullion would gain as currencies fell, and gold rose 4.7% the following month.##887|Gold prices ease in Asia on profit-taking as Ukraine events eyed

Commodities Mar 10, 2014 10:27PM ET

Investing.com - Gold prices eased in Asia on Tuesday on profit-taking as markets await developments in the ongoing Russian standoff in the Ukraine.



On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,340.30 a troy ounce, down 0.09%, after hitting an overnight session low of $1,328.20 and off a high of $1,344.90.



Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Monday.



Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices.



The data extended the dollar's gains into Monday, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.



Fed bond purchases, currently set at $65 billion a month, soften the dollar by suppressing interest rates to spur recovery by encouraging investing and hiring.



Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 0.32% at US$20.843 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were down 0.37% at US$3.031 a pound.

His situation: Carlson, who works for a small engineering company, said his company cancelled the employees’ health insurance plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield that he liked for a new one. According to Carlson, the new plan significantly increased his co-pays, deductibles, and maximum out-of-pocket costs.

What it means: Carlson said he experienced the following rate increases with his new plan: monthly premium from $1,117 to $1,175; calendar deductible from $200 to $500; maximum annual out-of-pocket from $600 to $5,000; generic drug co-pay from $10 to $15; office visit co-pay from $30 to $35; emergency room visit from $0 to $200.

His view: Carlson said he is “furious” about the rate increases and believes ACA is widening the gap between working and non-working Americans. “Nothing got better for us,” Carlson said. “The statement (by President Obama) that if you like your plan, you keep your plan, well, I liked my plan but I wasn’t able to keep it.

Quiznos has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reduce its debt by more than $400 million.

Quiznos listed debt of more than $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.

The chain said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan.

Senior lenders “overwhelmingly” support the plan and the chain will continue operations during reorganization, according to a company statement. The company has received $15 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its senior lenders in order to keep functioning during its restructuring period.

“Our business plan includes several key elements aimed at supporting our franchisees, including reducing food costs, implementing a franchise owner rebate program,” Quiznos Chief Executive Stuart Mathis said.

Quiznos says the bankruptcy won’t affect its customers.

“The plan is intended to increase the Company’s flexibility as it executes operational enhancements designed to strengthen performance, revitalize the Quiznos brand and reinforce its promise as a fresh, high-quality and great-tasting alternative to traditional fast food offerings,” the company said in a press release.

Analysts say Quiznos has been hit hard by competition from Subway and other sandwich chains, and by legal challenges from franchisees who claim that Quiznos forces them to pay above-market prices for food and supplies.

“They expanded too fast, they had a weak franchisee network,” Bob Goldin, executive vice president at Chicago-based restaurant researcher Technomic Inc., told Bloomberg. “Once the Paneras of the world came along, I think, many consumers thought that was a better quality price point. And Subway came in on the lower end and aggressively promoted themselves as fresh.”

A pre-packaged bankruptcy is when an entity negotiates a deal with creditors and other interested parties in advance and presents that to a bankruptcy court judge. Pre-packaged plans greatly reduce uncertainty and legal fees.

Quiznos was founded in 1981 and operates restaurants in all 50 states and 34 countries, according to its website. It has about 2,100 stores, all but seven of them franchised, according to today’s statement.

This would be the second major financial restructuring in two years for Quiznos, which has about 2,100 stores, down from about 5,000 in 2008.##891|A view of downtown Shanghai in November, 2013

China is planning a major expansion of its transport networks and urban infrastructure as it seeks to increase migration from rural to urban areas, lifting incomes and demand to drive continued economic growth.



The 2014-20 urbanisation plan released on Sunday aims to boost domestic consumption by increasing the proportion of urban residents among China's population of almost 1.4 billion to 60 per cent by 2020, up from 53.7 per cent at present.



Among the biggest obstacles to the planned relocation of several hundred million rural residents is the huge infrastructure development needed to accommodate the new wave of city dwellers as well as reform of the country's "hukou" registration system.



This complex system of residency registration is a major sticking point because it controls the benefits that residents can enjoy. The system denies basic services to those who relocate without permission, fanning social unrest.



China's leaders, however, will make it easier for rural migrants to obtain residency status in smaller cities, with the intention of helping to unlock the nation's huge potential domestic demand. Urban salaries are higher than rural incomes, meaning that a larger city-based population should have greater spending power.



"Domestic demand is the fundamental impetus for China's development, and the greatest potential for expanding domestic demand lies in urbanisation," state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the plan from China's State Council, which added detail to previous announcements about the urbanisation drive.



Rail links



The plan will create "huge" demand for investment in public infrastructure, with authorities seeking a substantial increase in social housing as well as the development of expanded urban underground transport networks by 2020.





Every city with more than 200,000 residents will be covered by standard railways by 2020, the plan said, with high-speed services connecting cities with more than 500,000 residents. The civil aviation network, meanwhile, will cover about 90 percent of the population.Authorities are also targeting environmentally friendly growth, a serious issue for a nation that has been bogged down in pollution issues including toxic levels of smog, polluted waterways and so-called "cancer villages".These villages, hit by high levels of water, air and soil pollution, are a symptom of China's many years of rampant economic growth, when environmental issues took a back seat to financial rewards.The 2014-20 urbanisation plan said it will improve water safety and air quality."Green production and green consumption will become the mainstream of city economic life. The amount of power and water-saving products, recycled goods and green construction will be raised substantially," the report said.China will also increase the number of small and mid-sized cities, boosting less-developed regions in the west of the country and improving services to meet demand from the influx of rural residents, the plan said. Copyright @ Thomson Reuters 2014##892|Empty##893|Empty##894|Revelation suggests person who delivered 'All right, good night' message from missing plane knew system had been shut down

The person in control of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 issued their last communication to air traffic control after the first set of aircraft communications was disabled, Malaysian authorities have confirmed, adding further weight to suspicion that the plane was hijacked.

The latest revelation suggests that the person who delivered the "All right, good night" message to Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers just before the Boeing-777 disappeared from their radar at 1.22am and diverted from its scheduled flightpath to Beijing was also aware that the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars) had been manually shut down.

Investigations still do not appear to know who was at the helm and what their intentions were when the aircraft disappeared from civilian radar more than a week ago.

Experts on aircraft maintenance have explained that the plane's communications system can only be disabled manually – a process that requires switching a number of cockpit controls in sequence until a computer screen necessitates a keyboard input.

Authorities have not yet disclosed whether the person who issued the last message to controllers was Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, or an unknown third person. It is also unclear if such messages are recorded by air traffic control and are available for expert analysis to determine who the voice belongs to.

Malaysia Airlines could not be reached for comment and Malaysia's transport ministry declined to comment.

Malaysia's police chief, Khalid Bakar, has said authorities were investigating all crew, passengers and ground staff involved with MH370 under a penal code that includes hijacking, sabotage and terrorism. Police had questioned Zaharie's friends and family, and dismantled and reassembled at headquarters a flight simulator Zaharie kept in his house on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.

Police also searched Fariq's home, although it was unclear if anything was confiscated.

According to Malaysia Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together, reducing the probability of a co-ordinated plan between the pilots to hijack the aircraft.

Khalid told reporters that all 239 people on board – 228 passengers and 11 Malaysian crew – were being investigated for suspicious activity, but that police were waiting for background information from some of the nations whose citizens were on the plane.

Eight days after the Boeing-777 vanished, with no concrete leads on its whereabouts, investigators are now searching for the plane along two possible flight corridors from the its last known location at 2.15am last Saturday over the Malacca strait – one stretches south from Indonesia towards the Indian Ocean, a vast expanse with very little radar coverage; the other reaches north from Thailand up towards central Asia, a heavily militarised area whose airspace is carefully scrutinised.

There are 25 countries assisting in the search, said Malaysia's defence and acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein – raising the additional challenges of co-ordinating ground, sea and aerial efforts as well as the delicate diplomatic issue of sharing significant sensitive information, from satellite data to primary and secondary radar playback, as well as any ground, sea and aerial co-ordination efforts.

"This is a significant recalibration of the search," Hishammuddin told reporters on Sunday. "From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans.

The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult."

Malaysia's prime minister, Najib Razak, has already spoken with the heads of state of Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and India; the foreign ministry has briefed at least 22 countries regarding the new search efforts as well as any additional countries that may be able to provide assistance.

Those countries include Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia, with special assistance regarding satellite data requested from the US, China and France.

Surveillance airplanes and maritime vessels will also be needed in the search for the missing jet along the southern corridor, where the Indian Ocean can reach depths of two miles and radar coverage is patchy at best.

Malaysia Airlines has confirmed that the plane departed for Beijing with enough fuel only to reach its scheduled destination, so it would have been likely to run out after about seven hours' flight time – if flying at normal cruising altitudes. But with reports emerging that the aircraft may have been flying at altitudes as high as 45,000ft, authorities also confirmed on Sunday that the plane need not have been flying for the duration of the period it was picked up by satellites.

The satellite "pings" that were last read at 8.11am on Saturday – six hours after Malaysian military radar last detected the aircraft over the Malacca strait at 2.15am – could still have been transmitting data from the ground, if the plane were to have landed, said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Abdul Rahman.

"The plane can still transmit pings from the ground as long as there is electrical power," he said.##895|PARIS--The controlling shareholder of French cable operator Numericable Group SA (NUM.FR) Wednesday said he would not increase his bid for Vivendi SA's (VIV.FR) SFR.

In an interview Patrick Drahi said he had no reason to raise his offer. "I have worked seven years on this," Mr. Drahi told French daily Les Echos. "I have no reason to modify it."

Mr. Drahi's comment comes as Altice SA (ATC.AE), the Luxemburg-based holding group that controls Numericable, finds itself in a race with French conglomerate Bouygues SA (EN.FR) to buy SFR.

Altice on Tuesday confirmed it had made a firm offer to Vivendi which includes EUR10.9 billion in cash and would grant a 32% stake to Vivendi in the newly merged Numericable-SFR unit.

Bouygues on the other hand offered EUR10.5 billion in cash and a 46% stake in a newly merged Bouygues Telecom-SFR group.

Mr Drahi reiterated that his offer stands until Friday. He said a merged Numericable-SFR would be based and listed and pay taxes in France, in a bid to reassure French officials. He also said he would be the president of a merged group if his offer is picked.

It comes as Numericable, which listed on the Paris stock exchange last November, posted a 32% drop in full-year profit. Net profit fell to 65 million euros ($90.16 million) in 2013 from EUR86 million in the prior year, after it was hit by financial costs linked to acquiring new clients.

Revenue rose 0.9% to EUR1.31 billion and the group's total customers rose 5% to 1.71 million.

Related Articles##899|The state of Colorado reported today that recreational marijuana sales resulted in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month the drug could be sold legally without a prescription. The total for the month of January included $2.9 million in taxes for both recreational and medical marijuana and nearly $600,000 in fees, according to Colorado’s Department of Revenue.

Colorado marijuana laws

Consumption of medical marijuana with a doctor’s prescription has been legal in Colorado for several years, but retail sales of marijuana without a prescription just began on January 1st of this year. The Rocky Mountain state charges a 15% excise tax on pot businesses and a 2.9% sales tax on purchases of marijuana and refined marijuana products.

Too early to make accurate sales predictions

In a statement, Colorado’s Department of Revenue Chief Barbara Brohl said, “The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” but warned future retail sales, tax and fee revenues of marijuana will be “significantly affected in both directions” by a number factors.

“We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts,” Brohl elaborated.

The total number of licensed retail marijuana shops in Colorado is increasing rapidly. As of the end of January, official records indicate there are a total of 170 medical and retail marijuana outlets registered in the state. Fifty-nine shops had begun sales and filed monthly tax returns with the state.

The future of legal marijuana

Washington state has also recently legalized the retail sale of marijuana, and shops will open for business there in the second half of this year. Legal pot supporters in Alaska are hopeful of putting legalization to a popular vote there in August. Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are all currently considering legislation to legalize pot.

The company announced the inquiry on its website, saying it plans to “cooperate fully” with the FTC. “We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,” the company said. Herbalife’s stock fell on Wednesday after trading of shares paused for about an hour at 1 p.m. EST, according to Marketwatch. When trading resumed, shares had fallen.

The inquiry comes amid accusations and a lobbying effort led by billionaire Bill Ackman, who says the company is complex pyramid scheme. Ackman placed a $1 billion short—a bet that pays off only if the company’s stock falls—on Herbalife last December, and according a recent report in the New York Times, he has been pressuring lawmakers to investigate the company. On Tuesday, Ackman accused the company of breaking Chinese laws.

Herbalife has fiercely defended itself against Ackman’s assault.

“Ackman’s unprecedented campaign to destroy Herbalife has now been exposed for what it is: a cynical, self-serving attempt to manipulate the market by buying his way into an investigation to cover his own reckless $1 billion dollar bet,” the company said in a statement. “There has never been merit to his accusations.”##901|Empty##902|An investment report released March 6th by Steven Ruggiero of R.W. Pressprich & Co. focuses on J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP). The report highlights both the stock and debt offerings of the venerable and currently beleaguered retailer, rating the stock as a Market Perform and the senior unsecured notes as a Buy.

J.C. Penney common stock rating

While not overly sanguine on the short-term prospects of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) stock, Ruggiero does see longer-term potential in the equity. “We believe that the JCP Common Stock trades full relative to its key department store competitors given its continued earnings risk at this stage of its turnaround. Notwithstanding our continued “Market Perform” Common Stock rating, some metrics relative to future expected sales indicate that there may be more upside to the Common Stock from today’s levels.”

J.C. Penney senior unsecured notes a Buy

The report is largely focused on the positive prospects for J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) debt offerings. Ruggiero highlights several positive developments in the companies recent and near-future financial numbers. “We reiterate our “BUY” recommendation for the JCP senior unsecured notes. We have increased our FY14 and FY15 estimated adjusted EBITDA to $112 million and $476 million, respectively.”

The R.W. Pressprich & Co. reports projects the firm will be “modestly Free Cash Flow negative in fiscal 2014 and 2015, but see upside potential in our earnings/cash flow model. Free Cash Flow is projected at ($57) million and ($124) million in FY14 and FY15, respectively.” Ruggiero also notes that these projections do not include asset sales.

Refinancing likely by 2015

Last but not least, Ruggiero also focuses on the possibility, or from his perspective, the likelihood, of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) undertaking debt refinancing within a year or so. “We continue to expect that JCP will have sufficient financial flexibility to refinance its 6.875% Senior Notes due 10/15/15. Further, we would not be surprised if the Company refinances its 7.65% Debentures due 8/15/16 at the same time as it takes out its 2015 maturity.

The most important number, obviously, is the 951,116.21905382 balance. As you recall, Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy while stating a 850,000 BTC loss. This would suggest Karpeles’ estimates were off by a large margin. Whether all of this is accurate or not is an entirely different manner. What the leak does show us is how easy it was to grab nearly all of Mt.Gox’s user data as well as how hardened Karpeles’ blog was. Furthermore, the files contain the app Mt.Gox admins used to manage transfers. A screenshot appears below.

China’s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world’s second-biggest economy, sending London copper prices to their lowest in 44 months. Copper is often put up as collateral for lending.

Fears that China’s economy, the world’s second largest after the United States, is slowing triggered gold buying and dampened demand for riskier assets such as equities.

“For these last sessions, we have had a very definitive China-led safe-haven bid,” said Frank McGhee, head precious metals dealer at Chicago commodities brokerage Alliance Financial LLC.

“Gold benefits from China’s bond default and the industrial metals are getting whacked on the anticipation that China is slowing much quicker than people thought,” he said.

Spot gold gained 1.3 percent to $1,367.04 an ounce by 1:59 p.m. EDT (1759 GMT), having reached $1,370.60, the loftiest since September 20.

U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $23.80 at $1,370.50 an ounce.

Trading volume was about 250,000 lots, 65 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. Wednesday’s turnover is set to be its highest since January 29.

Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are also weighing on appetite for risk globally on a growing chance of western sanctions over Crimea.

The Group of Seven advanced economies will demand that Russia halt efforts to annex Ukraine’s Crimea region in a statement to be issued on Wednesday.

The market is awaiting the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on March 18-19. The U.S. central bank is most likely to announce another $10 billion cut to its monthly bond-buying stimulus, even after a series of U.S. economic data showing that growth has been hurt by harsh winter weather.

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

In other precious metals, silver gained 2.1 percent to $21.25 an ounce. Platinum was up 0.8 percent at $1,469 an ounce, while palladium rose 0.8 percent to $771.10 an ounce.##905|* China trade data weak

* McDonald’s February same-restaurant sales fall

* Boeing finds cracks in wings of Dreamliners in production

* Indexes off: Dow 0.41 pct, S&P 0.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.15 pct

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged modestly lower on Monday, and the S&P 500 held near record highs, as investors largely shrugged off unexpectedly weak data in China.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

“We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,” said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York.

“I don’t think it’s disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome.”

Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.4 percent.

Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P’s 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.

“That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?” said Kenny.

In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672.

McDonald’s Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.

Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42.

United Rentals Inc, gained 3.9 percent to $91.98 after the world’s largest equipment rental company said it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.##906|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on October 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

The announcement, in a government blog posted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, did not say how many new enrollees are the younger adults that President Barack Obamaneeds to make his new health insurance marketplaces a success.

But Tavenner said the pace of enrollment has been at its highest since late December, when there was a rush of interest from people who wanted coverage beginning January 1.

She said the federal website HealthCare.gov had 1 million online visitors over the weekend and more than 4 million visitors last week. A federal call center set up to take applications over the telephone had more than 198,000 calls last Thursday.

(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Chris Reese)##907|DETROIT -- General Motors is offering the 1.37 million U.S. owners of cars recalled for a faulty ignition switch a $500 cash allowance toward the purchase or lease of a new car, and is advising dealers to offer loaners to concerned customers.

In a March 4 notice to dealers, posted today on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Web site, GM said the cash offer is good toward any 2013-2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac.

"GM will not market or solicit owners using this allowance," the notice reads. "We ask that you not market to or solicit these customers either. This allowance is not a sales tool; it is to be used to help customers in need of assistance."

Customers who request a loaner will be able to use it until their car is fixed. GM also said it would pay to have vehicles towed to the dealership for those who request it.

The Wall Street Journal reported the discount earlier.

The notice says that GM will begin around April 7 to make repairs to the recalled vehicles, which include model years 2005-07 Chevy Cobalts; 2007 Pontiac G5s; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevy HHRs; and the 2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.

GM faces a Congressional probe and U.S. Justice Department investigation into its handling of the global recall of 1.6 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches, which have been linked to 12 deaths. GM previously cited 13 related fatalities, but on Tuesday revised the total to 12, saying it double-counted one death.

On the recalled cars, there is a risk that the ignition switch can move out of the "run" position, causing the engine to shut off and air bags to deactivate. The risk increases if the key ring carries extra weight or is jarred from rough road conditions or other impacts.

GM's notice also reminded dealers to advise customers that they should remove all items from their key rings, including their key fobs.

Also on Wednesday, auto safety advocates Clarence Ditlow and Joan Claybrook, who have criticized GM for not issuing a recall sooner, called on the automaker to create a $1 billion trust fund to compensate victims of safety defects in its vehicles. GM is not liable for incidents that occurred before its 2009 bankruptcy; it appears that most of the 12 deaths linked to the recall happened before the bankruptcy.

"By concealing the ignition key defect for at least 10 years, GM created more victims and then robbed them of their legal rights through the passage of time," Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety, and Claybrook, president emeritus of Public Citizen, wrote in a letter to CEO Mary Barra dated today.

In response to the letter, GM referred to a previous statement:

"GM is focused on ensuring the safety and peace of mind of our customers involved in the recall. It is true that new GM did not assume liability for claims arising from incidents or accidents occurring prior to July 2009. Our principle throughout this process has been to the put the customer first, and that will continue to guide us."

* Fourth-qtr comparable store sales decline 7 pct

* Shares fall as much as 7 pct

By Maria Ajit Thomas

March 11 (Reuters) - Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc forecast current-quarter earnings below analysts’ estimates as it struggles to attract shoppers amid intense competition from “fast fashion” chains.

American Eagle shares fell as much as 7 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

“Business has remained highly competitive and sales trends have been choppy so far this year,” Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Mary Boland said on a post-earnings call.

“Though we were encouraged by what we saw in the first few weeks of January, sales deteriorated and negative trends continued into the first quarter.”

Analysts had in the past lauded American Eagle’s product selection and had expected it to do better than other teen apparel retailers because of its stronger brand relevance.

However, a 7 percent decline in the company’s fourth-quarter comparable store sales and a weak forecast for the first quarter suggest that it continues to lose out to more nimble rivals.

American Eagle and other teen apparel retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch Co and Aeropostale Inc have seen sales slump in recent quarters.

Younger shoppers have shifted to chains such as Sweden’s Hennes & Mauritz and Spain-based Inditex SA’s Zara, which offer trendier and cheaper clothes.

American Eagle’s rival Urban Outfitters Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales on Monday, primarily due to fashion missteps at its eponymous brand.

The company, known for its Anthropologie and Free People brands, said it was working to improve the quality of products at the Urban Outfitters brand and to re-focus on the core 18-28 year-old customer.

American Eagle on Tuesday also ackowledged that it needed to innovate and improve its merchandise.

“Speed to market and fluid fashion flows remain a priority to drive the customer experience,” Executive Creative Director Roger Markfield said.

To set itself apart from rivals, American Eagle said it plans to drive its accessories and outerwear categories and to be innovative with distinct finishes, fabrics and washes.

Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said the company’s strategic direction on a longer-term basis remains in flux without a permanenet CEO in place.

American Eagle’s chief executive of two years, Robert Hanson, left in a surprise move in January.

GROSS MARGINS SLUMP

A shorter 2013 holiday shopping season and the extreme cold weather in parts of the United States have also added to teen retailers’ woes, forcing them to resort to heavy discounting to draw in customers.

American Eagle’s gross profit margin, excluding certain asset write-offs, fell to 31.9 percent from 41.2 percent in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1.

The company said it expects to break even on a per-share basis in the first quarter. The forecast excludes potential asset impairment and restructuring charges.

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 13 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also forecast a high-single-digit percentage decline in comparable store sales for the first quarter.

American Eagle’s fourth-quarter net income declined to $10.5 million, or 5 cents per share, from $94.8 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 27 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 26 cents per share.

Total revenue fell 7 percent to $1.04 billion, slightly above analysts’ expectations of $1.03 billion.

American Eagle shares were down 5.6 percent at $13.42. They have fallen about 33 percent in the year up to Monday’s close.

Urban Outfitters’ shares fell as much as 6 percent to $35.20 on the Nasdaq.##909|Why did this happen?

The executive was cited as saying: ‘The offer I’ve made has been valid since 5 March. I have no reason to modify it.’

As previously reported by TeleGeography’s CommsUpdate, last week Vivendi received two bids for France’s second largest mobile provider in terms of subscribers, from domestic broadband operator Numericable, majority owned by Altice Group, and Bouygues Telecom; both suitors have valued SFR at around EUR19billion–EUR20 billion (USD26.08 billion–USD27.45 billion). Numericable has tabled a bid which consists of EUR11 billion in cash (comprising EUR8 billion in debt and EUR3 million via a capital increase) and 32% of the new merged entity. For its part, Bouygues Telecom’s proposal comprises EUR10.5 billion in cash and 46% of the share capital of the new entity. Further, Bouygues Telecom has promised to stage an initial public offering (IPO) for the new company ‘as soon as possible’, with Vivendi given the opportunity to sell an additional 15% stake in the enlarged company.##911|Disclaimer

##912|Empty##913|Empty##914|Empty##915|Two weeks out from the ObamaCare enrollment deadline, a new survey shows about one-third of uninsured American have no plans to buy insurance -- despite the law's requirement to do so.

And despite the administration's aggressive campaign to spread the word about the health care law, the same survey shows a startling percentage of people still don't know about the Affordable Care Act's basic provisions.

The report from Bankrate.com was released Monday, in the final stretch of the government's effort to sign people up for coverage. After March 31, some who do not have coverage could face a penalty under the law -- though, in recent weeks, the administration has created wiggle room to let those who have trouble getting insurance avoid a fine.

The Bankrate.com report showed 34 percent of uninsured say they plan to stay uninsured. The most common reason cited was that they consider health insurance to be too expensive. Others are simply opposed to the health care law or think they are healthy enough to go without insurance.

But the poll revealed lingering hurdles for the Obama administration. Seventy-percent of uninsured Americans said they did not know about the law's subsidies, which are meant to defray at least some of the additional costs from buying health insurance.

"This is a staggeringly high percentage," Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman said in a statement

About half also said they hadn't heard about the looming enrollment deadline. This, despite increased efforts by the administration to urge Americans to sign up before March 31.

The poll of 3,005 adults was taken from Feb. 20 to March 9. It had a margin of error of 6.1 percentage points.##916|Trading firm Virtu Financial, which posted only one day of trading losses in five years, plans to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering, the company said in a regulatory filing.

The company, a market maker in equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities markets, intends to list Class A shares on Nasdaq under the symbol "VIRT." Virtu will have three other share classes.

TORONTO -- Longer-term fixed mortgage rates may soon be a better deal than variable rates for homebuyers, according to a new report by BMO Capital Markets.

BMO (TSX:BMO) chief economist Douglas Porter and senior economist Benjamin Reitzes say that historically, choosing a variable mortgage rate has been more "cost-effective" than locking in on a five-year fixed rate, but this may no longer be the case as signs of an improving economy continue.

It's been long anticipated that both the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to hike interest rates in 2015.

"True, it may have seemed that markets and economists have played the role of The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf on higher interest rates in recent years," says the report released Thursday, titled "Mortgage Choices: The Fix(ed) is In."

"But there are emerging signs that the tide is finally turning for rates, especially with the U.S. economy poised to accelerate. The bond market has sent out loud warning signals over the past year that the era of low interest rates may finally be drawing to a close."

Currently, a five-year fixed mortgage rate from one of the big Canadian banks hovers above three per cent, with variable rates ranging below that.

Porter and Reitzes say that as bond yields rise they will put pressure on borrowing costs and long-term mortgages.

"So, even if variable rates take some time to climb, we may not see such low fixed rates again any time soon," says the report.

They also said any potential hikes will affect most those who are already stretched too thinly in the housing market, so locking in at a higher rate may be beneficial for this group to weather any drastic increases.

"For those who don't have much financial flexibility and would run into difficulty from a pronounced upswing in interest rates (typically first-time homebuyers), any potential extra cost for peace of mind now appears to be a price well worth paying," according to the report.

Earlier this week, the Teranet-National Bank national composite price index found that home prices are steadily rising.

In February, Canada home prices rose 0.3 per cent.

The index, which tracks the average home price in 11 metropolitan markets, found that home prices were up in all five markets surveyed in Western Canada and were down in all five metropolitan eastern markets except Montreal.##920|Empty##921|Empty##922|Sales of recreational marijuana products in Colorado added more than $2.1 million to state coffers in tax receipts and other fees in the first month retail sales of the drug were allowed, state figures showed on Monday.

The figures, which the Colorado Department of Revenue said were in line with expectations, add to just over $1.4 million collected in taxes and fees on medical marijuana in the state in the same month.

Related: Legalizing Pot Makes Mexican Cartels Even More Dangerous

The figures for recreational marijuana include revenues from a 2.9 percent sales tax, a special 10 percent tax on retail pot sales and a 15 percent excise tax imposed on growers, as well as licensing fees, the department said in a statement.

The numbers indicate the state's recreational pot stores did about $14 million in gross sales for the month.

"We expect clear patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Barbara Pohl, executive director of the department.

Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the possession and use of small amounts recreational marijuana by adults age 21 or older in 2012, even as marijuana remains an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Colorado opened its retail pot shops in January, and Washington is slated to follow suit later this year. Under the Colorado legalization law, the first $40 million collected annually from the excise tax is earmarked for school construction and repairs.

The state legislature will decide how to spend any leftover money from marijuana taxes and fees.

Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalization of recreational cannabis, has told lawmakers he would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programs to prevent youths from using the drug.##923|Why did this happen?

King, which has a major office near Tottenham Court Road but is domiciled in Dublin, has set a price of between $21 and $24 per share for its New York Stock Exchange listing later this year.

The pricing values King at between $6.6 billion and $7.56 billion, with the top end over $ billion more than initial estimates. If the company floats at the top end of expectations 11 executives at King will be worth a combined $2.2 billion on paper.

King’s London-based chief executive Riccardo Zacconi stands to make up to $745 million from the listing. Zacconi will bank as much as $16.5 million offering shares in the company, while his remaining holding could be valued at $728.5 million.

Yorkshire-based entrepreneur and former Derby County FC director Mel Morris, King’s Chairman, is set to make up to $20.4 million from offering shares, while his remaining stake could be valued at as much as $854.8 million.

King’s management could also see their windfalls reach even higher if the float is over subscribed.

The company hopes to raise $533 million from the stock market listing, with 22.2 million shares being offered. 15.5 million will come from King and its executives, with the remainder offered by existing shareholders.

London-based venture capital firm Apax Partners will make up to $3.4bn, while Index Ventures could be as much as $599 million better off.

King was founded in 2003 by Zacconi and Toby Rowland, son of former Lonrho chief executive and Observer owner Roland “Tiny” Rowland.

The company originally developed small-stakes gambling games for sites such as Yahoo and MSN, before launching games on Facebook and mobile.

Candy Crush Saga, launched in 2012, has been a huge hit for the company and the smartphone version of the game has been downloaded more than half a billion times. The game helped propel it from a loss of $1 million in the first quarter of 2012 to a $159 million profit in the final three months of 2013.

But King admits that a risk to investors is the fact that 78% of all its revenues come from Candy Crush.##925|Sbarro LLC, the 800-restaurant U.S. pizza chain, filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years as customer traffic slowed in the shopping-mall food courts where many of its stores do business.

The company listed assets and debt of as much as $500 million each in a Chapter 11 petition filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Melville, New York-based Sbarro said in a statement that it will use court protection to quickly reorganize and close many underperforming stores under a plan already supported by holders of most of its debt.

“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Karam said in the statement.

A group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing, and the reorganization plan will eliminate $140 million in debt, Sbarro said. The filing won’t affect its 600 franchises worldwide.

The Sbarro family started the company 58 years ago after moving to Brooklyn, New York, from Naples, Italy. MidOcean Partners LP acquired Sbarro in January 2007 for $417 million. The chain reported losses in 2008 on higher costs for ingredients such as cheese, flour and pasta and filed for bankruptcy in 2011.

Overseas Expansion

Karam, previously an executive at fast-food chain Wendy’s Co., led a comeback effort after joining Sbarro as CEO in 2013. To offset slow growth in the U.S., where muted consumer spending took a toll on Sbarro’s stores, the company opened 81 new locations overseas in 2013. In February, it closed 155 stores in North America.

Restaurant chains including Bennigan’s and Steak & Ale, both owned by Metromedia Restaurant Group, and Buffets Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in the three years before Sbarro’s 2011 filing, hurt by the worst U.S. economic slump since the Great Depression.

Uno Restaurant Holdings Corp., also a pizza chain, entered bankruptcy in January 2010. Midland Food Services LLC, the operator of 92 Pizza Hut restaurants in six states, and Commissary Operations Inc., a distributor of food and supplies to chains, also sought court protection.

First Bankruptcy

Sbarro’s first trip through bankruptcy began in April 2011 and ended in November of that year. Under that reorganization, first-lien lenders gained ownership and the company eliminated 70 percent of its debt. The earlier Chapter 11 filing listed assets of $471 million and debt of $486.6 million.

Unsecured creditors with as much as $173 million in claims got nothing in the first bankruptcy, as an auction drew no bids and was canceled.

Standard & Poor’s said in July that Sbarro’s debt was unsustainable after it borrowed to fund cash operating losses. S&P called the pizza market fragmented and competitive. Sbarro is also vulnerable to declines in shopping-mall traffic and the volatility of ingredient prices, the ratings company said.

When news of the probe broke Wednesday afternoon — after the LA company’s stock was halted in trading for about 30 minutes — Herbalife shares plunged.

They had been up about 4.4 percent but then pivoted and were off about 11 percent within minutes. They closed at $60.57, down 7.4 percent.

Although the battle is far from over, the news is a victory for Ackman, who has spent the past year pressing federal regulators and nine state attorneys general to investigate the company he believes is a fraud.

After Ackman went public with his short, the company gained even wider media attention when other billionaires — Carl Icahn, George Soros and Bill Stiritz — lined up against the hedge-fund activist.

Herbalife, a distributor of nutritional shakes and weight-loss supplements, became, at times, a very public battleground for the investor warriors.

Ackman and Soros on Wednesday declined to comment. Icahn and Stiritz did not return calls.

Herbalife, which has strongly denied Ackman’s accusations and has launched a massive lobbying campaign to defend itself, said it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace.

“We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,” it added.

The FTC confirmed the investigation.

Brent Wilkes, the executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, which has been in the forefront of the push for an investigation, said, “We believe the FTC is absolutely doing the right thing, and we are hopeful the information we were able to provide them from victims and others was convincing and that they are acting on our request to make sure that Latino communities and others are not being defrauded by the company.”

The nonprofit organization also helped nine Hispanics recently file complaints with the Illinois Attorney General’s office, said a spokeswoman.

A spokeswoman for Illinois AG Lisa Madigan,confirmed the complaints. It has not made a decision about a formal probe, she said.

Felipe Colon, a former Illinois businessman who recently moved to Florida, is one of the nine.

Colon told The Post he became an Herbalife distributor in 2008, when the economy was failing. After three years and a full-time commitment, Colon said he lost about $35,000.

“[Herbalife distributors] promised me that in a few months I was going to be making a lot of money,” he said. “They lied. They talk about money, money, money and show you the checks they received from the company.”

To keep his distributorship, he said he had to buy more product, which he could not sell.

Colon also paid $250 a month for rent at a nutrition club he used as a recruitment venue, he said. People who came there and decided to become Herbalife distributors (now called members) did so because “they wanted to make money,” he said.##929|Empty##930|U.S. Navy SEALs have engaged in a sensitive four-day mission in the Mediterranean Sea to steer a rogue tanker full of illegally obtained Libyan oil back toward waters controlled by the Libya’s government, the Pentagon revealed Monday.

Using high-speed boats under the cover of darkness, the SEALs seized the vessel from Libyan rebels during a raid off the coast of Cyprus on Sunday night, thwarting what the Pentagon described as an illicit plan by the rebels to raise funds by selling the oil on the black market.

No shots were fired during the covert operation, which the Pentagon said took less than two hours and was launched after the governments of both Libya and Cyprus asked the United States to intervene. President Obama approved, signing off on the mission at roughly 10 p.m. Sunday night.

According to the Pentagon statement from spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby, the SEALs then moved quickly, using the USS Roosevelt, a guided-missile destroyer positioned in waters southeast of Cyprus, as a jumping-off point.

The fast-paced series of events marks the latest in a case that has taken a series of twists and turns since early this month when the oil tanker, sailing under the name “Morning Glory,” showed up at the eastern Libyan port of Sidra.

The port is one of several in Libya currently under blockade by rebel militias attempting to seize control of the nation’s oil wealth as part of a bid to achieve autonomy from Tripoli for eastern Libya.

The arrival of the Morning Glory, which cruised in flying a North Korean flag, triggered outrage in Tripoli, where Libya’s struggling national government threatened to use its own military forces to thwart any sale of oil to the tanker.

With North Korea having since denied any connection to the Morning Glory, news reports have said the tanker was actually being navigated by a Egypt-based company. The vessel was ultimately — and officials say illegally — loaded with oil owned by the Libyan government’s National Oil Company before it left port en route to an unknown destination.

The development so enraged Libya’s parliament last week, that the body responded by sacking the nation’s Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

At some point during the process, meanwhile, the Morning Glory was taken over by three armed Libyans presumed to be aligned with rebels who control the oil port. The New York Times reported on Monday that Navy SEALs, who subsequently seized the tanker, captured the three Libyans and that the Morning Glory’s captain had described them as “hijackers.”

It was not immediately clear whether the men will remain in U.S. custody, or whether or where they may be charged with a crime.

Army Col. Steve Warren, another Pentagon spokesman, said only that the Morning Glory is now being guided by the U.S. Navy toward Libya and expected to reach the fringes of Libyan territorial waters within four days.

Col. Warren added that the tanker is being escorted by the USS Stout — a guided-missile destroyer based out of Norfolk, Va.

The Navy SEAL team that initially spearheaded the recovery operation has since departed from the Morning Glory, he said, adding that 25 USS Stout crew members are now aboard the tanker.

The U.S. crew members have the three Libyan rebels in custody, Col. Warren said.

Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen's first news conference as Fed chairwoman. The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.

WASHINGTON � The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest today with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts. Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen�s first news conference as Fed chairwoman.

The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.

Will Yellen embrace predecessor Ben Bernanke�s approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed�s economic stimulus?

Or, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?

No major announcements are expected when the meeting ends on Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it might drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed to raise short-term rates eventually. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.

The Fed�s most-recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows � well past� the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials recently have suggested scrapping that threshold and instead describing more-general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.

Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there�s � not a large expectation� that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.

One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market�s health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they�re no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.##932|Shares of nutrition supplement network marketing firm Herbalife (HLF) plunged after the company disclosed its operations are being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.

United States stocks closed sharply lower, retreating from last week's records as investors paused to assess recent US economic data while shrugging off uncertainties surrounding Ukraine.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 67.43 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 16,351.25.



The S&P 500 index eased 9.54 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 1,867.63 while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 27.26, or 0.63 per cent, to 4,307.19.



The S&P 500 has gained 0.8 per cent so far in March, after running up 4.3 per cent in February, and is hovering around Friday's record closing high of 1878.04. Meanwhile, the Dow was 1.1 per cent away from its December 31 record high of 16576.66.

William Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates, said investors saw little reason to make big bets either way given the session's dearth of major economic reports.

"Investors really don't have a handle on whether or not this economy is getting stronger or weaker and how that might affect first-quarter earnings," Mr Lynch said.

"Investors are taking a wait-and-see approach."

Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, said the market drifted lower in the absence of a catalyst to lift stocks and overtake "psychological resistance" to new records.##938|The Malaysian air force Thursday morning sent an aircraft on an eight-hour search mission in areas around Subang, Penang, Phuket and the Andaman Sea, but found no trace of the Airlines plane that went missing Saturday.

At 5 a.m., the C130 Orion transport aircraft took off from Subang air force airport maintaining a height of 760 metres and flew to the Andaman Sea, covering the area around Subang, Penang and Phuket. But nothing has been found, pilot of the mission said, Xinhua reported.

Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said Thursday on his Twitter account that the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) also sent an aircraft to the South Sea where Chinese satellites have reportedly captured images of floating objects.

"MMEA's Bombardier has already been dispatched to investigate claims of debris found by Chinese satellite imagery," Hussein said.

It was reported that the satellite images showed three suspected floating objects of various sizes, the largest one estimated to be roughly 22 metres by 24 metres in size.

Aircraft and vessels sent out by Thursday, however, found no debris in the waters where Chinese satellites reportedly spotted the three objects, Vietnamese Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu said, according to a report from Phu Quoc.

Airlines flight with 239 passengers and crew on board vanished without a trace about an hour after taking off from early Saturday. The Boeing 777-200ER was presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast in the South Sea.

The plane took off from at 12.41 a.m. Saturday and was due to land in Beijing at 6.30 a.m. the same day. The 227 passengers on the flight included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians.

Contact with the plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1.40 a.m. Saturday when it was flying over the Ho Chi Minh City air traffic control area in

authorities dispatched two aircraft and two ships to the waters off the country's southern coast, said Pham, who is leading a frontline command in Phu Quoc island.

In addition, the Vietnam air force sent four aircraft to scour the land area in Vietnam's southern part. These comprised one seaplane, two AN-26 aircraft, and an Mi-171 helicopter.

However, these land area searches across the province of Kien Giang, located about 250 km from Ho Chi Minh City in the Mekong delta region, and U Minh Thuong national forest park yielded no clues, air force officials said.

In Beijing, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said Thursday that would not give up search for the missing passenger jet "as long as there is a glimmer of hope".

Li made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session.

"We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found," he said. "We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images."

Li said that the Chinese government has asked all engaged in the ongoing massive search to enhance coordination to investigate the cause and to locate the missing plane.

Currently there are eight Chinese vessels in the area where the aircraft is suspected to have crashed, another one is on its way, and 10 satellites are being used to provide information and technological support, Li said.

The search for the missing flight has so far involved at least 40 ships and nearly 40 aircraft from 12 countries.##939|You are using an older browser version.

Time Warner, which makes billions of dollars in the Los Angeles market, is “stiffing” the city by not turning over the funds in 2011, “precisely when we needed it the most, when we were confronting the peak of the recession,” Feuer said.

The fees would have funded police officers and sidewalk repairs, he said.

Time Warner officials denied any wrongdoing.

“As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen in the city of Los Angeles,” according to a company statement. “We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit. It will now be resolved through the legal process.”

According to the city attorney’s office, Time Warner is required to pay the city a franchise fee to install cable wires and boxes under city streets, on telephone poles and elsewhere in the “public-right-of-way.”

The cable provider was also required until 2009 to pay a fee toward providing public, governmental and education television programming, including allowing the public use of its studios, Feuer said.

Time Warner has refused to pay $9.7 million in franchise and other fees owed from 2008 until 2011, despite attempts to resolve the dispute “amicably,” Feuer said.

“We’re filing litigation not as a first resort, but as a last resort,” he said.##942|Thank you for Reading!

In a sit-down interview with WebMD posted Friday, the president dismissed any concern that people resisting the law could somehow keep it from functioning. ... During the wide-ranging interview with WebMD's Lisa Zamosky, Obama also called out governors and state lawmakers who have resisted the health care law's massive expansion of Medicaid -; a decision he said was based purely on politics. "This is a source of great frustration for me," he said. "We don't have the ability at the federal level to pressure those states to do what they should be doing" (Cheney, 3/14).

The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index nudged up 0.1 percent as a decline in gasoline prices offset an increase in the cost of food.

The CPI had ticked up 0.1 percent in January and last month's gain was in line with economists' expectations.

In the 12 months through February, consumer prices increased 1.1 percent, slowing from a 1.6 percent rise in January. The February increase was the smallest rise since October last year.

Stripping out the volatile energy and food components, the so-called core CPI also rose 0.1 percent for a third straight month. In the 12 months through February, core CPI rose 1.6 percent after rising by the same margin in January.

Consumer inflation is running below the 's 2 percent target, which suggests interest rates will probably remain near record low levels even as cuts back on the amount of money it is injecting into the economy each month.

With job growth accelerating and industrial production and consumer spending strengthening, economists expect the to announce another $10 billion reduction to its monthly bond purchases when policymakers end a two-day meeting on Wednesday.##948|Empty##949|King Digital Entertainment, maker of hit mobile phone game "Candy Crush Saga", expects to be worth up to $US7.6 billion ($8.5 billion) when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

Carroll County Republican Delegate Justin Ready reacts to news of this merger. Download This File

WBAL's Steve Fermier talked with Andria Cheng of Marketwatch.com about the sale of Jos. A. Bank. Download This File

Looks like the corporate tug of war between Jos. A. Bank and Men's Wearhouse is over.

The rival company based out of state has apparently been successful in its attempt to acquire the Hampstead clothing company known for its 2 for 1 offers.

The price is reported to be $1.8 billion in cash.

The latest tender offer from Men's Wearhouse was approved unanimously by both boards.

Doug Ewert, President and Chief Executive Officer of Men's Wearhouse, will lead the combined company.

The deal will create the fourth largest men's clothing retailer in the country.

Men's Wearhouse fashions typically appeals to younger buyers while Jos. A. Bank is favored by older, more conservative and often more affluent customers.

And it's yet to be seen how the combined company will approach merchandizing, according to clothing retail analyst Andria Cheng with Marketwatch.com.

The Bank name will survive the merger, but, it's not clear how many stores will be closed in the process, Cheng said.

As for the Bank headquarters in Hampstead, Maryland, no clear decision on that is yet evident.

The combination will have 23,000 employees with 1,700 stores nationwide.

It's expected the Eddie Bauer purchase by Bank will likely be broken off.

One lawmaker who represents Carroll County in Annapolis calls news of the takeover a "sad occasion."

Republican State Senator Joe Getty told WBAL News that he is "worried that in a competitive industry, the company might close the (Jos. A. Bank) headquarters."

Getty says he has heard from some worried workers at the Hampstead facility, which employs 780 people. It is one of Carroll County's largest employers.

Republican Delegate Justin ready told WBAL News that, "from the corporate perspective it looks like a pretty good deal. They (Jos. A. Bank) got the asking price they wanted for their company."

Ready says he is concerned about the future of the Carroll County headquarters.

Neither Getty nor Ready say they have received any briefing from the company on the deal.##951|You are using an older browser version.

Yet in light of the longer-term trends that helped the Dow's bull market reach the ripe old age of 5 yesterday, many investors are looking forward to the beginning of the first-quarter earnings season for signals about whether the blue-chip index has further to climb in the months and years ahead.

Will winter ever end?

The main storyline that most investors have followed closely during the first quarter is the impact of harsh winter weather on the economy. Already we've seen countless companies cite weather problems to justify sluggish results, with even major producers citing issues that could hurt first-quarter earnings. For instance, automaker Ford (NYSE:F) said last week that delays in fleet orders due to the winter weather played a sizable role in the company's overall 6% drop in total sales in February from year-ago levels. Many retailers have issued similar warnings, with the latest earnings insight report [opens PDF] from FactSet revealing that 86 companies in the S&P 500 have given negative guidance on first-quarter earnings per share.

On the whole, earnings growth for the first quarter is now seen coming in at just 0.5%, down from expectations of 4.4% at the beginning of the year. Consumer-discretionary stocks such as Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have seen some of the biggest downward revisions, with GM cutting its earnings estimates nearly in half. Among S&P sectors, only utilities have seen higher expected earnings growth, and those stocks obviously aren't included in the Dow Industrials. Yet in the past, a recurring theme has played itself out over and over again: earnings expectations fall in the period leading up to the time at which companies actually start to report results, but then companies are able to beat those modest expectations, sending actual earnings growth higher by the end of earnings season.

From that perspective, the early reporting companies in the Dow will have a lot of insight to give to investors. Nike (NYSE:NKE) reports next week, and investors expect to see a substantial rise in sales accompanied by a slight decline in earnings from year-ago levels. Those results would be very much in line with what retailers reported recently, as heavy promotional activity has hurt margins. Even though Nike's strong brand value should help it maintain revenue growth more easily than some competitors, even the athletic-apparel giant has to deal with shoppers who don't want to venture into the cold.

Bank stocks will also be among the earliest to issue earnings numbers, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) slated to report on April 11. Banks will have lower hurdles to overcome, as investors already expect headwinds from falling levels of mortgage refinancing to have substantial year-over-year impacts on earnings. Yet housing has been relatively resilient so far, raising the hope that new-purchase mortgages can pick up the slack and help boost overall earnings. With financial stocks among the leaders of the latest push up for the Dow, JPMorgan and its peers need to deliver on their promise in order to keep the bull market going.

Are markets too expensive?

The other question earnings season should help answer is whether the Dow has simply risen too far. After such strong gains since 2009, concerns about extreme valuations for stocks have risen to new heights. Yet in driving prices higher, earnings have also posted substantial gains, with forward earnings estimates almost doubling since the 2009 lows. Indeed, FactSet noted that current forward multiples are actually below their 15-year average, albeit with that period including not only inflated late-1990s projections but also the boom markets of the mid-2000s.

Those who would like the 5-year-old bull market to reach its next birthday hope that earnings can keep growing enough to satisfy gun-shy investors who grow more nervous at every new record high. First-quarter earnings season will reveal some useful secrets in determining whether the Dow can keep climbing or whether investors should brace for tough times ahead.##956|Maritime Reporter and Engineering News’ first edition was published in New York City in 1883 and became our flagship publication in 1939.

The plans are contained in a 2014-2020 urbanisation document unveiled on Sunday by the State Council, China's Cabinet, that was reported by the official Xinhua News Agency.

The plan says rural residents employed in cities will see their incomes rise, increasing consumption, while investment in urban infrastructure, public service facilities and housing will drive economic development.

At present, permanent urban residents make up 53.7 per cent of the population of almost 1.4 billion. China plans to raise this to 60 per cent of the total population by 2020 - on a par with that of developing countries with similar per capita income levels as China and lower than the average of 80 per cent for developed countries.

Xinhua said the plan states that regular railways will cover cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020 and high-speed railways will connect those with more than half a million residents.

China's urbanisation first picked up pace with market reforms in the early 1980s. By 2011, half the country's population had moved into cities. However, a rigid, decades-old household registration system that assigns either urban or rural status under the old planned economy means tens of millions of migrants officially remain residents of their rural hometowns and have limited education, health and pension benefits in the cities, fuelling discontent nationwide.

Xinhua said only 35.7 per cent of the country's people had urban status by the end of 2013 and the full claims to public urban services that this entails. It said the plan calls for residents with city status to account for about 45 per cent of the total population by 2020.##958|Why did this happen?

Sbarro's submittal to bankruptcy protection is the company's second time in the past three years.

Sbarro has $140 million in money owed it plans to get control on, which has been hurt by people not frequenting shopping malls as much as they've done in the past Reuters reported Monday.

Sbarro also has $175.4 million in company valuables and $165.2 million in legal responsibility costs Reuters reported.

The deal calls for bankers to grab hold the reigns of the company based on a chapter 11 reorganization plan, which enables Sbarro to rapidly come out of bankruptcy from the first time it went on it prior to a May 7th deadline Reuters reported.

Top management at the franchise restaurant company, which has locations in mall food courts are working to continue to make Sbarro a profitable company.

"The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step," David Karam CEO at Sbarro told Reuters.

Sbarro has 799 restaurants in more than 40 countries where 2,700 individuals make a living, The 582 locations owned by franchise owners are not affected.

February saw the company shutter 155 locations out of the 400 it possesses Reuters reported.

"Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model," Michael Whiteman, a restaurant consultant and president at Baum and Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York told Reuters. "Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order."

"I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term," he said. "The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing," Whiteman told Reuters.##962|McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather.

Analysts estimated a 0.1 percent decline, the average of 15 projections from Consensus Metrix. Domestic same-store sales slid 1.4 percent, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said in a statement today, while analysts anticipated a drop of 0.6 percent in the U.S.

McDonald’s, which has more than 14,200 U.S. locations, has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods. The fast-food industry also is struggling with shaky consumer confidence and a severe winter that McDonald’s says hurt its U.S. sales last month.

“Weather was definitely an impact in the month of February -- that’s going to be a drag on everybody,” Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. Also, rival fast-food chains are introducing new items, improving stores and drawing U.S. diners away from McDonald’s, he said.

“The other players from Wendy’s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they’re taking back some share,” he said.

The shares fell 0.3 percent to $95.20 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. McDonald’s slumped 1.6 percent this year through March 7, the most recent full trading day, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Restaurants Index declined 1.7 percent.

Pressuring Margins

Little-changed global comparable-store sales so far this year will pressure margins in the first quarter, McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said in the statement.

While U.S. consumer sentiment rose in February after declining in January, the economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than was previously estimated. Smaller gains in consumer spending, inventories and exports are weighing on the economy and indicate less momentum heading into 2014.

McDonald’s, along with other chains, is trying to draw diners and boost revenue in the morning. While it pushes new McCafe beverages and $1 coffees, Starbucks Corp. is revamping its breakfast sandwiches, and Yum! Brands’s Taco Bell is rolling out breakfast foods, such as sausage burritos and waffle tacos, to its U.S. stores this month. Burger King Worldwide Inc. also has said it’s focused on improving and advertising its morning menu.

European Sales

Same-store sales rose 0.6 percent in Europe and fell 2.6 percent in the company’s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Analysts estimated drops of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, which is owned by Kaul Advisory Group in Wayne. Same-store sales declined 8.7 percent in Japan last month.

In February, breakfast foods and extended hours contributed to a “strong performance” in the U.K. and positive same-store sales in France, McDonald’s said.

Comparable-store sales are considered an indicator of a retailer’s performance because they include only older, established locations. McDonald’s has about 35,400 restaurants worldwide and 81 percent of those are franchised.

McDonald’s is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 22.

Last month I talked about the rising cost of a favorite bottle of French wine. Only six dollars thirty years ago, the same bottle now costs $20. Assuming steady inflation, it could cost over $60 in 2044. I joked that the solution to the inflation problem is not to drink more wine now while it’s cheap. A friend responded, “That made me laugh, until I realized I might not be able to afford it in the future!”

The effects of inflation really hit home when we stop working and expenses increase faster than income. You might ask, how do I “know” inflation will continue in the future. Last month, I cited some statistics on historical inflation. This month, I’d like to examine some of the factors driving inflation.

The U.S. Federal Reserve wants our economy to experience inflation. You may have heard the terms “quantitative easing” and “zero interest rate policy.” In plain English they mean, respectively, “printing money” and “keeping interest rates really low.” These policies, implemented in response to the recent financial crisis, are intended to restore growth and to battle deflation, the risk that prices fall (which is a much worse can of worms.) While they have helped avert a nasty deflationary spiral, employment growth is still insufficient. The Fed intends to continue these policies until the desired effect is achieved: more jobs and higher inflation.

The federal government also wants to encourage inflation. In the downturn it borrowed money to stimulate growth in the economy. Over time inflation decreases the value of the money borrowed. Inflation is good for borrowers and bad for lenders (bondholders.) Think of the bottle of wine. I borrow $20 to buy a bottle today. I pay interest every year (like a bond) and pay back the principal, $20, years later. By the time I pay it back, the $20 doesn’t buy as much as it did when I borrowed it, due to inflation. From the government’s point of view, inflation functions to reduce the debt burden. Pretty clever, huh?

While the Federal Reserve and the government use inflation to their advantage, it hurts savers, bondholders and those living on “fixed incomes.” The effect is called “financial repression.” People who were doing OK living on the interest from savings and CD’s know well what this term means. Effectively, their “fixed income” is worth less than it was ten years ago when interest rates were much higher. The low interest rate environment also means the rates we are earning on bonds are depressed, or rather, “repressed.”

These powerful forces ensure that inflation will continue. Like an invisible tax, it erodes our purchasing power, putting us at risk for running out of money later in life. As the pace of economic activity increases, the money printing of the last few years will turn up the burner on inflation. If the Fed doesn’t manage things well, the rate of inflation could be even higher than we estimate. Our best defenses are planning and wise investing. Plan ahead, keeping inflation in mind, and invest in assets that will appreciate in value over time.##966|Empty##967|##968|Bank governor Mark Carney faces grilling by MPs on currency market rigging scandal

Under pressure: Mark Carney is to answer questions by MPs over the Bank's closeness to foreign exchange dealers

Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be drawn into the growing scandal over currency manipulation on Tuesday when MPs allege the Bank’s governance has been inadequate.



Carney will answer questions from the Treasury Select Committee, alongside executive director of markets Paul Fisher.



The Bank is facing questions over its closeness to foreign exchange dealers and whether it tacitly condoned manipulation of the market, amid a widening regulatory probe of currency trading.



A staff member at the Bank was suspended last week over the affair.



The Bank said that an extensive review of documents, emails and other records has to date found no evidence that staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information.

It added: ‘However, the Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes.’

MPs are concerned that the review may not have been sufficiently independent, and that the Bank’s non-executives should have been in charge of any investigation.

##969|Earlier this year, Virtu Financial Inc. was named as one of the 24/7 Wall St. Top 10 IPOs to Watch for 2014. We had the very first filing as one of a confidential filing matter with the SEC, but now Wall Street can count this one listed as officially coming to market after a Monday filing. The company will trade under the stock ticker VIRT on Nasdaq.

Virtu is one of the top market makers and liquidity providers in many markets. Its revenues are generated by buying and selling large volumes of securities and other financial instruments — high frequency trading and market making. Virtu even claims to make markets by providing quotations to buyers and sellers in over 10,000 securities and financial instruments on more than 210 different exchanges, markets and liquidity pools in 30 countries around the world.

Virtu’s underwriting group is rather large, and it would lead us to believe that more (perhaps much more) than just the nominal $100 million mentioned in the filing. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Sandler O’Neill are the book runners. Co-managers are listed as Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS.

Be advised this IPO is for Class A shares only and all the shares being sold are being sold by the company, but there will be four classes of stock. The Class A common stock and the Class C common stock will have one vote per share. The Class B common stock and the Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share. The filing says”

TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Vincent Viola, our Founder and Executive Chairman, will hold all of our issued and outstanding Class D common stock after this offering and will control more than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock.

The filing also said about its financials:##970|JEFFERSON CITY � Marijuana legalization advocates on Monday took their cause a little bit further than they had before when the House Crime Prevention and Public Safety Committee heard nearly three hours of testimony that focused heavily on what they call the social evils of continued prohibition.

Critics of legalization, from law enforcement and the committee, described what they view as new social evils arising from greater access to the drug, especially to minors attracted by marijuana candy and soft drinks.

The bill's sponsor, state Rep. Chris Kelly, D-Columbia, said his views on marijuana changed during his four years as an associate circuit judge.

"I saw too many young people whose lives were ruined by a small amount of marijuana," Kelly said. "The U.S. and Missouri have spent tens of billions of dollars on enforcement against marijuana, and it would be hard to prove we stopped one person from smoking one marijuana joint."

Jason Grellner, who testified against the bill for the Missouri Narcotics Officers Association, said legalization would increase use rates, especially among minors. In 20 states with legal medical marijuana, he said, teen use rates are the highest in the nation. The sale of cookies, candy and soft drinks laced with marijuana � he said pot ring pops are popular � makes it tempting to children, he said.

"How is a child supposed to know the difference between a marijuana-infused one and one that is not?" Grellner asked.

Last year, Kelly sponsored a bill to decriminalize marijuana and received a hearing on the last day of the session. This year's proposal is full legalization, and the hearing took place before lawmakers took their midsession break.

Columbia attorney Dan Viets, one of the state's most persistent supporters of marijuana legalization, said the state is "seeing the evolution of a new marijuana policy."

Viets is chairman of Show-Me Cannabis and Missouri coordinator for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML. A Show-Me Cannabis initiative proposal formed the basis for Kelly's bill.

For two mothers, one who drove 240 miles and another who drove 50 to testify, legalization is about saving the lives of their sons. Both boys were born with rare genetic conditions that result in severe seizures.

Brandy Johnson brought her 10-year-old son Tres from Bernie in Stoddard County. For six weeks, she said, Tres has been one of a handful of Missourians legally using cannabidiol, a chemical in marijuana that does not make a person high, to control his seizures. From 120 or more seizures a day, now he has 50 or fewer.

Johnson said she pays $170 per month for the oil from a strain of marijuana bred in Colorado to produce cannabidiol but very little THC, the psychoactive chemical in pot.

"I would move to Colorado if I could afford to," she told the committee. "But I had to drop out of my second semester in nursing at" Southeast Missouri State University. "This isn't a bunch of stoners who want to get high."

Heidi Rayl brought her son Zayne, 4, to the hearing from Versailles.

He is not certified to receive cannabidiol legally. Rep. Mike Colona, D-St. Louis, asked Rayl if legal medical marijuana would give her relief.

A 22.2 milligram supply of cannabidiol oil costs $400, she said. If she could grow marijuana legally, she could grow and process her son's medicine at practically no cost, Johnson said.

"Help us save our son's life," she said.

Merkel 'extraordinarily impressed' by Portgual's reforms

16.42 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she was "extraordinarily impressed" by Portugal's reform efforts as she met the bailed-out eurozone country's prime minister.

Merkel told a joint press conference with Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coehlo in Berlin that Portugal had undergone a drastic reform process that had placed a heavy burden on its people.

She said:

One can say today that growth can be seen, that the economic data have strongly improved, and very positively point to the future.

That's also being seen in the development of interest rates for government bonds.

Today’s European market was one of two halves -'pre-Putin’ and ‘post-Putin’

16.16 That is the view of Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets.

Early morning trading was hesitant as investors took a breather from yesterdays’ rally. This all changed after Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his widely-watched speech announced that Russia “respects the rest of the territorial integrity of Ukraine”.

On the face of it this is good news for international trade out of Ukraine including the export of energy and agricultural commodities. The thousands of Russian troops on the Eastern Ukrainian border do leave room for scepticism over the Russian President’s comments.

Break in at EDF's nuclear plant in France

14.56 Dozens of Greenpeace activists have sneaked in to France's oldest nuclear plant, run by EDF, to highlight alleged security weakness at atomic facilities.

Roughly 60 activists broke into the Fessenheim plant in eastern France near the border with Germany and Switzerland and hung a banner reading "Stop risking Europe" on the side of one of its reactors.

Greenpeace said the action was to "denounce the risk of French nuclear power for the whole of Europe".

A spokesman for EDF said it was "functioning normally" despite the break-in that ended late afternoon.

EDF will run Britain's first nuclear plant to open in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset.

EDF has proposed that the new plant would consist of two 'European Pressurised Water’ reactors, each with a capacity of 1.6GW.

The plant would generate about 7pc of the UK’s electricity needs, enough to power about 5m homes, and should keep generating power for 60 years.

European markets breathe sigh of relief on Crimea

14.37 Having slipped in early trading, European markets are now on the rise following Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech in the Duma and signed a treaty with Crimean leaders on the strategic Black Sea peninsula becoming part of Russia.

Markets appeared soothed by his words that Crimea "was always Russian", which will no doubt infuriate the West.

Alexandre Baradez, an analyst at IG France said Putin was "less vindicative than expected, in particular less isolationalist, and the desire he indicated to maintain ties to the West without a doubt gave a boost to indices."

Trader David White told AFP that "equities are making a tentative move higher on news that Mr Putin, for now, does not intend to carve up any more of Ukraine, putting both ease and money back into risk assets."

London's FTSE 100 rose 0.32pc from Monday's close to 6,589.42 points, Frankfurt's DAX 30 added 0.59pc to 9,234.76 points and the Paris CAC 40 climbed 0.96pc to 4,313.13 compared.

Barclays awards 12 executives £32m in shares

13.23 Barclays has handed its top executives share bonuses worth more than £30m as it faces pressure from investors to explain the scale of awards handed to its staff despite a fall in profits.

Our Banking Editor Harry Wilson has the details.

Antony Jenkins, chief executive of Barclays, received shares worth £3.81m from the bank, while the largest individual payout went to US banking boss, Skip McGee, who picked up a bonus valued at £8.87m.

The share bonuses are about £8m lower than last year’s awards, though the 2013 figure was inflated by a close to £18m handout to Rich Ricci, the former chief executive of the investment banking division who left Barclays last year.

In total, the 12 Barclays executives received share worth £31.8m but immediately sold about half of their awards to pay the tax due on the bonuses.

Following these sales, Mr Jenkins retained a holding in Barclays shares worth £9.2m based on the bank’s market share price of 232.59p at the time the bonuses were granted.

Sainsbury's boss plays down prospect of a price war

12.24 Justin King, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, played down the prospect of a price war in the grocery industry and the rise of discounters during a conference call with journalists.

King, who is leaving Sainsbury’s this summer, said that price cuts announced by Tesco and Morrisons in recent weeks were part of the “normal cut and thrust” in the industry.

He also said there was “nothing new” in the popularity of discounters, and that their market share was higher in the early 1990s, when KwikSave was still operating.

He said:

We are well placed to compete.

Sainsbury’s reported a 3.1pc fall in like-for-like sales in its trading update, the company’s worst performance for more than a decade.

Crimea unrest pushes German investor sentiment to 7-month low

10.49 Investment sentiment in Germany has hit its lowest level in seven months this month amid uncertainty about the fallout for Europe's top economy from the crisis in Crimea.

the widely watched investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute fell by 9.1 points to 46.6 points in March, its lowest level since August 2013.

ZEW president Clemens Fuest said:

In this month's survey, the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany.

Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.

More on Nemat Shafik

10.31 Nemat Shafik, who will be joining the Bank on August 1, is currently the deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund.

In a statement from the IMF on Ms Shafik's departure it said she oversaw much of the Fund’s country work in Europe, including the programs with Greece and Portugal, as well as Arab countries in transition. She also led the efforts to integrate the Fund’s work on capacity building and technical assistance.

Shafik is stepping down as deputy MD immediately but will stay on until mid-June as Special Advisor to managing director Christine Lagarde

Shafik joined the Fund as Deputy Managing Director in April 2011 after resigning her position as Permanent Secretary of the UK Department for International Development.

She has a M.Sc. in Economics from the London School of Economics and a D.Phil. in Economics from Oxford University, she has also served as the youngest ever Vice President at the World Bank.

Lagarde said:

The fact that she is leaving us to take up such an important post is testimony to her broad command of policy issues, her superb leadership and communications skills, and her global reputation

I have highly valued Minouche’s contribution as part of the senior team and I have greatly appreciated her advice, candor, and loyalty.

Ben Broadbent to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor as woman joins MPC

10.15 The full story of those new Bank of England appointments is now live.

Our economics correspondent Szu Ping Chan notes that Nemat Shafik, who will serve in the newly created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, is the first woman to serve on the MPC since Kate Barker, who was a member of the committee between 2001 and 2010.

Ms Shafik - known by her nickname Minouche - has served as a deputy managing director of the IMF since April 2011 - where she oversees work on countries in Europe and the Middle East.

EU car registrations up but crisis not over

09.29 New car registrations in the European Union - a key indicator of economic health - rose in February, industry data showed Tuesday, but still remained close to a historic low.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said that demand for cars in the 27 EU countries it surveys (Malta is not included) rose by 8pc, the sixth consecutive gain.

However, the overall total of cars registered (861,058) was the second-lowest result for February since ACEA started collected EU-wide data in 2003.

The car sector in countries still recovering from the eurozone crisis generally fared better than others, with Spain showing a 17.8pc rise in new registrations and Italy up 8.6pc.

Eurozone powerhouse Germany reported a 4.3pc rise but Europe's second-largest economy France was the only major nation to experience a decline, with new registrations down 1.4pc on the month.

Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen showed an 8pc gain but Asian manufacturers were the main drivers of demand.

Toyota registrations were up 16.2pc, Suzuki up 33.1pc and Mitsubishi up 25.3pc.

Sainsbury's shares rise

09.03 Despite Sainbury's shares rising 1.3pc on the back of its fourth quarter trading update, analysts at Shore Capital are not impressed with the numbers reported by the supermarket group. They told clients:

Sainsbury's long-standing record of positive like-for-like sales has come to an abrupt end with its Q4 2013/14 trading update that is a little worse than our downbeat expectations. Such a performance will be a particular disappointment to outgoing CEO, Justin King CBE, and perhaps more of a concern and worry to his replacement, Mike Coupe, and the group's shareholders.

Overall, the FTSE 100 is off 12 points at 6,555 with Ukraine still dominating the agenda. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at broker Interactive Investor, said:

The current limited action imposed on Russia does not appear to have had a major impact on investor sentiment yet, with investors relying on the idea that self-interest in Europe will prevent the threat of more aggressive sanctions.

However, the major issue is not Crimea, but the potential for further fallout in mainland Ukraine, with a breakup in the east of the country a real possibility. Putin's speech this morning will be closely watched, but if he continues to take a hard line on the matter, investor optimism that the issue is resolved may be misplaced.

Asos plunges 19pc

08.38 Following those results from the online retailer (see 08.13), shares in ASOS have plunged 18.6pc in early trading this morning.

Sainsburys is fairing better - shares had slipped 1.6pc when markets opened but have regained some of the losses and are now down 0.9pc.

Frankfurt's DAX 30 dipped 0.1pc to 9,172.05 points and in Paris the CAC 40 slid 0.18pc to 4,264.42.

Morning City briefing

08.13 Louise Armitstead has a roundup of this morning's corporate news in the City briefing morning email.

Asos continues to cement its position as one of British retail's big winners. The online fashion retailer has reported a 21pc jump in revenues in the past two months, taking its sakes to £182m for the past six months, up 32pc from last year. The group now has 8.2m customers - a 36pc rise from last year, more than half of whom are international buyers. Even so, Nick Roberterson has warned that Asos's earning margin with be reduced this year to about 6.5pc due to investments in warehousing in the UK and Germany and its new venture in China.

Berkeley Group has once again credited George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme with its continuing strong growth. In a trading update, the housebuilder has said it anticipates completing 30pc more houses this year than at the peak of the market in 2007. Cash on forward sales has risen to £1.9bn from £1.75bn in October, reflecting particularly strong demand in London and the South East.

In a preliminary statement, Cairn Energy has reported post-tax losses of $556m, down from a profit of $73m last year.

Rank Group has announced the resignation of Colin Child, its senior independent director, with immediate effect after just two years on the board.

Sainsbury's sales fall for first time in nine years

07.52 Some bad news for Sainsburys this morning. The supermarket has suffered its first decline in sales for nine years as competition in the supermarket industry heats up.

Our retail correspondent Graham Ruddick has the details:

The company reported that like-for-like sales fell by 3.1pc excluding fuel in the 10 weeks to March 15. The drop in sales ends a run of 36 consecutive quarters of sales growth under chief executive Justin King.

The Sainsbury's boss said the overall grocery industry is growing at the slowest pace since 2005, with shoppers enjoying a slowdown in food inflation.

Mr King said: Although some economic indicators are showing an improvement in the health of the economy, we expect the outlook for customers to continue to be challenging for the coming year.

"We remain confident that our differentiated offer, supported by 'value for values', Nectar data and Brand Match, will allow us to outperform our peers in the year ahead."

Asian shares up after Wall Street rally

07.45 Asian markets rose in Tuesday's trading following a Wall Street rally as traders shrugged off growing tensions between the West and Russia following Crimea's vote for Kremlin rule.

After the weekend vote, the result of which was widely expected, attention turned to economic matters. Better than expected US data provided support as investors await the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.

Tokyo rose 0.94pc, or 133.60 points, to 14,411.27, Seoul added 0.66pc, or 12.68 points, to close at 1,940.21 and Sydney advanced 0.51pc, or 27.0 points, to 5,344.6.

Shanghai closed flat, edging up 1.52 points to 2,025.20, and in late trade Hong Kong was 0.34pc higher.

Day ahead

07.30 Few things to look out for today.

Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, will deliver the annual Mais Lecture today when he will discuss his plans to overhaul the Bank’s operations.

The Governor is expected to ask Bank staff to work across its different committees and allocate more resources to its forecasting.

Last week he told MPs the shake up was needed in the wake of allegations about manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. A new deputy governor is also expected to be announced. Mr Carney is due to speak at 6pm and is holding a press conference at 7pm.

The Treasury Select Committee is holding a one-off session on the performance of the Royal Mint. In Europe, Angela Merkel is meeting Pedro Passos Coelho, the Portugeuse prime minister, in Berlin. And the US Federal Open Market Committee is starting a two-day meeting, its first under Janet Yellen, the new chairman of the Fed.

The FTSE 100 is expected to open slightly lower this morning.

The tax total reported by the state Revenue Department indicates that $14.02 million worth of recreational marijuana was sold. The state collected about $2.01 million in taxes, the Associated Press reported.

State officials say the numbers were in line with what was expected.



Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational pot to anyone age 21 or older. Sales began Jan. 1.

Colorado voters approved last year a 15 percent excise tax, a 10 percent special sales tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax on recreational pot. They said that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go toward school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers, the AP said.

“Our strategy is to build the best network and use it to grow - not on marrying two operators in decline just to wring out cost savings,” Denoyer said. “There is no need for asset sale or concessions or anything.”

He added: “Our synergies can be put in place very quickly because they are network based. The synergies can come through as early as this year.”

Bouygues Telecom said on the weekend it had agreed to sell its mobile network and much of its spectrum to smaller rival Iliad as a way to head off competition regulators’ concerns about its pending bid for SFR.

“I don’t even need to explain my plan B because I don’t think the other project is credible,” Denoyer added, referring to the rival offer.

Ananthalakshmi SINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - Gold extended losses to a second session on Monday after strong U.S. jobs data eased worries of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal. Fears among Chinese investors over a slowdown in the world's second biggest economy also hurt prices, with investors in Shanghai futures and spot contracts dumping bullion. The drop in prices after five straight weekly gains comes despite weaker Asian equities and a geopolitical crisis in Ukraine, which would typically support gold. "Gold is being pushed lower on the nonfarm numbers and higher 10-year U.S. Treasury yields," said one precious metals trader in Hong Kong. "There is some pressure from China as well because of the weak exports data." Spot gold, which fell as much as 0.8 percent on Monday, was down 0.6 percent at $1,331.50 an ounce by 0710 GMT. It dropped nearly 1 percent on Friday. U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus - which had boosted gold prices. China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide. "We can see liquidation from the Shanghai futures exchange and there is no fresh buying interest on the physical side," said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Precious Metals. China is the top consumer of gold. But with the crisis in Ukraine still unresolved and tensions between the West and Russia remaining high, gold will not drop below $1,320, Fung said. Chinese prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices on Monday, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of over $20 in the beginning of the year. Investor sentiment towards gold has been positive this year after a 28 percent drop in prices in 2013. SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 1.50 tonnes to 805.20 tonnes on Friday. Hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to the highest in more than a year, according to Friday data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Other precious metals were all lower tracking gold but palladium was still trading near its highest in a year, boosted by fears of supply constraints from geopolitical tensions in top producer Russia and mine strikes in second-biggest producer South Africa.

The tanker was taken from Es Sider, Libya’s biggest export terminal, to a port under government control, said Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman for National Oil. The destination is Qasr Ahmed port in Misrata in western Libya, the official Lana news agency said.

Libya’s inability to restore oil exports from its eastern terminals was among the reasons cited by Citigroup when it raised its 2014 forecast for Brent crude to US$103 a barrel from $93 a barrel on February 25. The country is pumping about 275,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with 1.4 million bpd last July.

Brent futures trading on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange fell 0.9 per cent to $107.97 a barrel.

The self-declared authorities in eastern Libya are demanding that Barqa, the local name for the region that usually produces more than half of the country’s oil, receives 15 per cent of national crude revenue.

Mr Elharari identified the ship yesterday as the North Korea-flagged Morning Glory, with a capacity of 350,000 barrels. It changed name from the Gulf Glory on February 27 and also started flying the Asian country’s flag on that date too, having previously flown the flag of Liberia, he said. There is another tanker with the name Morning Glory that is unrelated to the one off Libya’s coast.

The registered owner of the Gulf Glory is Sea Pride Shipping in Sharjah in the UAE, according to a European Commission database.

“Sea Pride Shipping can confirm it is the registered owner of the vessel Gulf Glory but is currently in dispute with the vessels operators,” Sea Pride said. “Sea Pride Shipping currently has no operational control over the vessel, including where she operates and what cargo she may be carrying.”

The ship’s cargo would be valued at about $38 million at the current price for Brent crude, the benchmark for Es Sider grade. The crude loaded on the tanker belongs to Waha Oil, a joint venture between the national oil companies Marathon Oil, Hess and ConocoPhillips, according to the state-owned company.

Follow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights##987|Empty##988|News that Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HTZ) will spin off its construction equipment rental business pleased investors, who pushed shares sharply higher after the opening bell Monday. The Financial Times reported on Friday evening that the spin-off deal valued the unit at about $4.5 billion.

The construction equipment rental business accounted for $1.1 billion of Hertz’s revenue in the first nine months of 2013. The company had explored a spin-off to shareholders or a reverse Morris trust, which is a combination of a spin-off and a merger. The New Jersey-based rental company also was rumored to be talking with potential merger targets.

In an apparent attempt to ward off pressure from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, the company enacted a poison pill near in December of 2013, following consultation with its outside advisers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays. However, Icahn later denied having a stake in or targeting Hertz.

Details of the potential spin-off of the equipment business announced Friday could be released as early as this week, according to the Financial Times. Hertz is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday before the market opens.

Shares of competitor Avis Budget Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CAR) were down slightly in early afternoon trading.

Hertz shares opened at $28.01 Monday morning, up more than 7%, and they were trading around $27.30 in the noon hour. Shares are now down less than 5% year to date and have traded between $19.73 and $29.81 in the past year.##989|Urban Outfitters, Inc., a lifestyle products and services company, engages in the retail and wholesale of general consumer products.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) again took to the airwaves to criticize the proposed merger of Comcast with Time Warner Cable, telling “CBS This Morning” on Monday that the combination will see customers paying more.

“I think consumers will end up paying more, there will be less competition, there will be less innovation and, worse, even worse service,” he said.

Franken pointed out that he cannot block the merger, even though he has a high-profile platform as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, scheduled to hold a hearing on the transaction later this month.

But he suggested that there is “a little bit of a too-cozy relationship between Comcast and the regulators.” He opposed Comcast’s merger with NBCUniversal, but the deal was approved with conditions.

“I sent out an email to folks, to Americans getting their feelings about what kind of service they get from Comcast, and if they think this deal will be good,” Franken said. “I got 60,000 responses, and, believe me, people don’t like their service from Comcast, and they don’t think this deal is going to help them.”

The FCC and the Justice Department will be reviewing the merger. Franken also criticized Comcast for not complying with conditions of the NBCU transaction, contending that the FCC has had to “fine them.” He was referring to the FCC’s $800,000 settlement with Comcast of a complaint that it was making it difficult for consumers to find its offering of affordable, standalone broadband service.

Franken also started to laugh during the interview when correspondent Anthony Mason asked him about Comcast’s contention that the merger with TWC won’t be harmful because they do not overlap in markets.

“I’m laughing because we’re supposed to take great comfort from the fact that this is the No. 1 cable company and the No. 2 and they don’t compete in any market, so they’re saying you should be happy that we have these monopolies and now we’re going to be one company with twice as much of a monopoly,” he said.

##992|SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — U.S. stocks enter their sixth year of a bull market this Monday, joining a rare group of multi-year stock surges that can support early retirements, pay off college debt, and make pension funds whole.

Or not. The fifth year of the last bull market ended spectacularly and painfully for investors in October 2007, leaving many so scarred they avoided stocks years into this latest rebound.

The good news: The few cycles that make it past their fifth birthday keep motoring along, churning out as much as a decade of gains. Momentum is your friend: On average, the sixth year has produced 26% growth.

The bad: There's plenty that’s different this time around, starting with the Federal Reserve’s full-throttle bond buys to flatten yields. The S&P 500 already produced an eye-popping 30% gain last year. The economy needs to get back its mojo — the 3% growth rate that’s been elusive since 2005.

“What ended nearly every [bull market] was a recession, so we need continued economic growth,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.

The almost five-year-old bull market started on March 10, 2009, when the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.10% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.55% both rebounded 6% in one day off their respective multi-year lows reached March 9. At the low, the S&P 500 closed at a bottom of 676.53, a drop of nearly 57% from its October 2007 highs. The Dow closed at 6,547.05. Since then, the S&P 500 has climbed 177% and the Dow has gained 151%.

Group of three

Concern that days are numbered for the current bull market are not unfounded. A minority of bull markets since 1945 have made it to their sixth birthday.

P/E ratios are back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007.

Including the current bull market, there have been 12 since the end of World War II. Of those, only half of them made it to a fifth birthday, according to Sam Stovall, chief equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, in a recent note.

After that, the list gets halved again for those making it to a sixth birthday. Those bull markets include the 7-year bull market that ended in August 1956, the 6-year bull market that ended in November 1980, and the nearly 10-year-old bull market that ended in March 2000. Those go-go days of the 1990s bull market, which ended in the Internet bust, fattened nest eggs with an S&P 500 gain of over 400%.

The history is tantalizing, particularly for investors still repairing the damage from the last bear market and a concurrent housing market collapse.

Here’s what this bull market needs to do to make it to its sixth birthday, says Stovall:

U.S. economic growth needs to ramp up and reach 3% by the end of 2014 supported by gains in auto sales and housing.

Earnings per share growth needs to increase in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014 coupled with gains in revenue. Stovall expects an 8% advance in EPS with revenue rising 3.7%.

Congress needs to indicate that it is working toward meaningful tax reform legislation by 2015 to help spur increased capital expenditures and repatriation of foreign earnings.

Valuations based on price-to-earnings ratios remain supportive.

That last part can be troubling given concerns that stock prices have grown faster than their supporting earnings. Stovall said that while the trailing 12-month P/E is above average since 1947, it’s actually below the average when the consumer price index has been in the 1.5% to 2.5% range.

For the economy, a 3% growth rate for the U.S. isn’t a slam dunk. The U.S. economy hasn’t grown 3% or more in nine years. A recent revision of fourth-quarter GDP figures showed the economy growing at 2.4%, down from a previous figure of 3.2%.

Read: Is the White House’s 3.1% growth forecast still too rosy?

In this aging bull’s favor, it’s still cheap to borrow to buy and build. The yield on the 10-year Treasury US:10_YEAR note is in the 2.7% range — in contrast to 4.65% at the end of the last bull market in October 2007.

Stocks are ‘shackled to earnings growth’

Back in March 2009, P/E ratios for stocks in the S&P 500 had fallen below 11x. Now, they’re back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007. That means that earnings growth has become even more crucial to cool off those multiples.

Bull markets tend to tap out when trailing 12-month P/E ratios get into 17x to 18x territory, Kleintop said. Earnings can support valuations for now but are not enough to support another big market surge, Kleintop said.

“We know what expensive looks like, so we’re pretty shackled to earnings growth,” Kleintop said.

That view is pretty consistent with what many strategists were calling for in December: After a big jump in 2013, stocks will likely grow in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014.

Another indication the current bull market will see a sixth birthday is that market breadth is relatively stable, meaning no one sector or handful of stocks is fueling the market.

The biggest drivers of the current bull market have been consumer discretionary stocks, followed up by financials, industrials, and tech stocks.

LPL Financial Jeff Kleintop

That’s opposed to the bull market that ended in 2000, where tech stocks were far and away the sole market driver, according to Kleintop. In the current bull market, growth is being driven by cyclical stocks, which are closely linked to the economy. While they may be expensive, consumer discretionary stocks have been more productive than they have ever been, and are therefore deserving of a higher multiple, Kleintop said.

Priceline, Netflix among big bull winners with 1000% gains

Notable consumer discretionary stocks that have jumped in price by more than 1000% over the past five years include Wyndham Worldwide Corp. US:WYN CBS Corp. CBS, +1.30% Priceline.com Inc. US:PCLN Wynn Resorts Ltd. WYNN, -0.93% Expedia Inc. EXPE, -0.63% Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -1.90% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.05% according to FactSet.

In 2013, financial and consumer discretionary earnings led the pack with gains of 16.3% and 11.3%, respectively, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. That’s compared with the 4.9% increase in the S&P 500 for the year. In addition, consumer discretionary stocks also saw an above-average gain in revenue at 4.8% in 2013.

Outside of GDP growth in the 3% area, the key to economic growth in 2014 will have to come from capital expenditure spending and hiring from corporations, which are sitting on record cash piles. That’s crucial because capital investment accounted for no GDP growth in 2013, according to Kleintop.

Tech benefits

Capital expenditure spending may improve in 2014, according to a recent note by Russ Koesterich, BlackRock global chief investment strategist.

Given the lackluster recovery, Koesterich said companies are still conservative given the overindulgences and excess capacity of the past two bull markets. Also, consumer confidence is just beginning to recover with current levels still under the long-term average. As the consumer strength returns to speed, certain industries are likely to benefit.

“In terms of specific beneficiaries, we believe spending is likely to be led by financial, telecom and service industries,” Koesterich noted. “This suggests that technology companies may be beneficiaries if capital spending begins to accelerate.”

The number of rides taken on public transportation systems in the United States last year was the highest it has been since the 1950s, according to a report from the American Public Transportation Association released today.

While Indiana has less public transportation than some other states, it is in line with the upward trend.

The new report shows ridership in Bloomington increased 1.6 percent and 2.7 percent in Indianapolis in 2013.

IndyGo reported more than 10.2 million dixed route trips taken on its buses, its highest number since 1991.

President and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association Michael Melaniphy says the report’s findings reveal a fundamental change in people’s lifestyles.

“2008 was a high watermark when fuel was over four dollars here and five dollars on the West Coast,” he says. “People were flocking to transit, they came, they found out they liked it and they stayed. Now fuel is well under four dollars and they’re continuing to stay. It’s also driven by growth and the economy. As people go back to work they’re riding transit more. About 50 percent of all trips are on transit.”

According to the Indiana Department of Transportation’s 2012 Public Transit Report, one percent of people over 16 used public transportation to get to work in Indiana, compared to the national average of 5.2 percent. A new proposed bill to expand mass transit in Central Indiana, however, could help to increase these rates.

Vice President of Government Relations for the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Mark Fisher supports the bill and says the new report attests to public transportation’s long-term viability.

“People are choosing different lifestyles than they were even 10 or 15 years ago where it was a continuous push out to suburbs. Transit provides a very cost-effective option for them to be able to move around their community,” Fisher says.

If the proposed bill passes, funding would come from fares as well as business and local income taxes.

No. 1 US city where employees quit over bad commutes New data from Robert Half shows that Chicago is the American city with the greatest amount of employees who say they quit their job over “a bad commute.”##997|Text size

China's February exports contracted sharply by 18% from a year before, much weaker than the 7.5% increase expected by Bloomberg. Financial markets did not read this kindly, sending the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index down 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite Stock Market Index slumped 2.9%.

China surprised the market last month too, posting a 10.6% year-on-year increase in January exports, whereas the market had expected a 0.1% rise.

Taken together, both pieces of data were distorted by the timing of the Lunar Chinese New Year, which occurred early in January this year. Therefore, analyst urge us to combine the two months of data and read them as one data point. Combined, January and February's exports declined by 2% y/y.

But China has another distortion. This time last year, the exports data were artificially inflated by hot money inflow in the disguise of "exports". This year, the hot money flow is a lot smaller, as evidenced by a 21% year-on-year drop in exports to Hong Kong, where such fake cross-border trades are often initiated.

Adjusting for all the data anomalies, UBS estimates the true growth rate was about 5% in dollar terms. Comparing to December's 7.5% adjusted growth reading, the new data, without down, is a signal that China's exports sector has slowed. UBS urges us to be patient and wait for the March data to come out, but the market is never patient. This morning, the iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) is down 2%, so is the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI).

The weak export data this year is not unique to China. The other Asian export powerhouses - South Korea and Taiwan - saw a similar slowdown. In Taiwan, for instance, by combining the January and February data together, export growth moderated to 0.4% from 1.8% in the fourth-quarter of 2013.

UBS analysts Tao Wang, Donna Kwok, Harrison Hu and Ning Zhang offered an explanation - bad weather:

The softening of China's export growth since late 2013 is consistent with recent developments in both Korea and Taiwan's export sector. Both economies saw a modest export moderation in January-February. Possible reasons for this include weaker US activity weighed down by unusually bad weather conditions (e.g., ISM manufacturing index dipped from 56.5 last December to an average of 52.3 in January-February) and slightly cooler growth momentum in Europe (e.g., Germany's IFO expectations index edged down in February).

CNOOC (CEO) lost 3%, PetroChina (PTR) is down 2.5% and Sinopec (SNP) is off 2.5%.##998|Empty##999|Empty##1000|Empty##1001|Empty##1002|PARIS (AP) -- Global growth is likely to remain sluggish as a slowdown in the developing world undercuts gains in Europe and the United States, a leading international economic body warned Tuesday.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said one-off factors like the harsh winter weather in North America and the U.S. government shutdown mean "growth for the major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be somewhat slower than in the second half of 2013."

The underlying trend for those economies, however, continues to be of strengthening growth, said the OECD, a think tank for the world's most developed countries, in an update to forecasts made in November.

Meanwhile, emerging economies, which now account for over half the world economy, "are experiencing a marked loss of momentum," the OECD said. If that continues, the OECD warned it "is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term."

In its World Economic Outlook, the organization forecasts global growth of 3.6 percent this year, from an estimated 2.7 percent in 2013. It says the recovery in the United States "is relatively well established," contrary to what it sees happening in the EU and Japan, where the OECD called for further monetary stimulus.

The OECD warned that while activity in the EU seems to be improving, "so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than in the other major economies."

It also warned that the dip in growth in the U.S. over the winter could have longer-lasting repercussion. "If the recent economic weakness were to durably depress confidence, it could undermine the recovery," the OECD said.##1003|Dong Ping, chairman and CEO of ChinaVision Media Group Photo: CFP

ChinaVision Media Group, which is set to receive investment of over $800 million from Alibaba Group, has decided that movie and TV content will be its future business focus and has halted most of its mobile Internet business, the company's chairman told the Global Times in an exclusive interview."Movie and TV content is expected to account for around 70 percent of our business in 2014," ChinaVision Chairman Dong Ping said, who has been in the movie industry for 18 years and has invested in many popular movies such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Dong said the remaining 30 percent includes print media, advertising and some other businesses, but the company's presence in this part is also declining.The company halted most of its newspaper, mobile gaming and mobile video business in 2013, which Dong noted were not his "fields of expertise" and that ChinaVision will focus on providing content.ChinaVision has gotten a great deal of attention recently after Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in it. Money from Alibaba will be used for future investments, it said in a filing on the Hong Kong bourse Tuesday."Production costs in the movie sector are rising rapidly thus Alibaba's investment is very important to ChinaVision, and it is hard for ChinaVision to secure such a big investment from other sources," said Hou Tao, vice president at EntGroup, an entertainment research service provider.Hou also noted Alibaba's strong presence in the Internet sector will also provide ChinaVision an advantage for it in promoting its products in the future.ChinaVision and Alibaba will establish a strategic committee to explore opportunities in online entertainment and media-related areas, ChinaVision said in the statement.Dong declined to comment on the deal during the interview as it is still yet to be completely closed.ChinaVision reported sales revenue of around HK$482 million ($62 million) in the first half of 2013, with net profit of HK$133 million.Dong said that the company originally was planning to produce about five movies and five TV series this year, but with Alibaba's investment, the plan could be expanded.##1004|BENGHAZI: Libya‘s rebel army on Saturday said it hoped to recapture areas to the south of Tripoli over the next 48 hours, as they attempt to push within striking distance of the capital.

After a retreat from around the plains town of Bir al-Ghanam some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Tripoli, spokesman Colonel Ahmed Omar Bani said the rebel army would soon try to push the frontline northward.

“In the next two days the (revolutionaries) will come up with answers, things will change on the frontline,” he said.

Bir al-Ghanam is at the foot of the Nafusa Mountains, where NATO forces have been bombarding loyalist positions.

Two armoured vehicles belonging to Qadhafi forces were destroyed in the town on Friday night.

The mountains were the site of a controversial French weapons drops for the rebels and have been one of the few battle lines which have shifted in recent weeks, mostly in the rebels’ favour.

Copyright AFP (Agence France-Presse), 2011##1005|Image copyright AFP Image caption Fonterra is the world's largest exporter of dairy products

New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.

Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.

Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption.

The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.

Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula.

Maury Leyland, a Fonterra manager said: "We have accepted all four charges, which are consistent with the findings of our operational review and the Independent Board Inquiry."

The dairy co-operative has since stepped up its quality control procedures.

In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning.

The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.

But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.

The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare.

Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.##1006|Shares in Fyffes have jumped by a third after news that U.S. fruit distributor Chiquita Brands International Inc is to buy its Ireland-based rival for $526 million. Newslook##1007|LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from UK lawmakers on Tuesday about what Bank officials knew about allegations that currency traders colluded to manipulate key exchange rates.

The unfolding scandal has so far seen more than 20 traders placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world’s biggest banks.

Below is a timeline on the scandal that has engulfed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, the world’s biggest financial market and which is now subject to a global investigation.

July 2006: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say the group, chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett, discussed “evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that ‘fixing business’ generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour.”

Spring 2008: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with “the relevant authorities in the UK.”

May 2008: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group say there was “considerable discussion” on the benchmark “fixings” again.

July 2008: A meeting of the BoE’s FX Joint Standing Committee’s chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion “that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation,” BoE minutes say.

April 2012: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular chief FX dealers’ meeting included a “brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings,” BoE minutes say.

June 2013: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London “fixing”.

July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers’ meeting for 4 July never takes place.

Sept. 2013: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing.

Oct 2013: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland’s market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating.

Dec 2013: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms.

Jan 2014: U.S. regulators visit Citi’s main offices in London. Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers’ sub-group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked.

Feb 4, 2014: Martin Wheatley, chief executive the FCA, Britain’s market regulator, says the FX allegations are “every bit as bad” as those in Libor. He also says the FCA’s investigation will probably run into next year.

Feb 5, 2014: New York’s banking regulator opens its investigation.

Feb 14, 2014: The Financial Stability Board, the world’s top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings.

March 5, 2014: The Bank of England suspends an employee as part of its internal investigation.##1008|Empty##1009|Empty##1010|Empty##1011|The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has "helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them."

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.##1015|American Transit Ridership Hits 57-Year High

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.##1016|Empty##1017|(Picture for representation only)

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said on Thursday the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) decision to ban import of products from its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat will not hurt the company much financially.

The facility is a "dedicated" cephalosporin plant and the USFDA move will have little financial impact on the company, a Sun Pharma spokeswoman told Business Today. She did not elaborate.

Analysts say the company can source cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is considered a low-value active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), from other facilities or from vendors, and so can escape any financial hit.

Earlier Thursday, the company said in a statement the USFDA move followed an inspection of the facility that identified some non-compliance of good manufacturing practices regulations. The drugmaker added that it has initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US regulator.

Analysts also say that the development could be a "perception hit" for the company given that it is the first such ban on an Indian facility. An analyst says that even if the development leads to only a two to three per cent impact on sales, it would hurt the company's image.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical recovered a tad in afternoon trade after falling more than six per cent in the morning. The shares were down about four per cent at Rs 580.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.##1018|Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt.

By Kathy Lien

The U.S. dollar is trading lower against most of the major currencies this morning, but is slowly recovering its earlier losses thanks to better than expected economic data. Like last week’s non-farm payrolls report, this morning’s retail sales and jobless claims numbers will harden the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering asset purchases. Before today’s releases, central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering. So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases.

Thankfully reducing stimulus won’t be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. For the first time since November, retail sales rose 0.3%. The dollar’s reaction to retail sales would have been stronger if there was a smaller downward revision to January data. However even though spending was revised lower the previous month, the fact that sales turned positive after two months of contraction is good news for the U.S. economy and should help sustain demand for U.S. dollars. The rebound in sales tells us that spending is finally recovering after a brutal winter and will most likely improve further in March.

The big surprise was in jobless claims, which dropped to its lowest level in 4 months. After last week’s improvement, economists were looking for weekly claims to snapback but instead they declined to 315k from 324k. With the 4-week moving average also falling to 330k from 336k, the Federal Reserve has every reason to believe that the labor market continued to improve this month. Combined with the 0.9% rise in import prices, the central bank will not only continue removing stimulus and drop the unemployment rate threshold but they should sound more optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy.

With no Tier 1 U.S. economic reports scheduled for release between now and next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, we expect the dollar to remain bid ahead of Janet Yellen’s very first monetary policy meeting as Chairwoman. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that there is enough momentum in the market for a significant dollar rally before the FOMC meeting. U.S. 10 yields may have to rise to 2.9% for USD/JPY to hit fresh 1-month highs. As for the euro, today’s reports should not pose a major threat to rally if the currency is supported by risk appetite.##1020|CL

Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy. Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday. Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January. The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of crude oil. Cushioning losses, however, awere ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

Gold gains on Ukraine standoff, soft Chinese data weigh Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Monday. Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices. Strong U.S. employment numbers and weak Chinese trade figures strengthened the dollar and capped gold's gains, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase. January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000. The data extended the dollar's gains into Monday, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.##1021|Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has staged a two-year war against Herbalife, betting that authorities in the US and other countries like China would ultimately determine the health-products retailer to be an illegal pyramid scheme.

Today Herbalife revealed that it had received a “civil investigative demand” from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulatory agency’s web site says it uses civil investigative demands to look into possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The mere announcement is a much-needed shot in the arm for Ackman’s Pershing Square fund, which has spent nearly $1.2 billion shorting Herbalife shares (i.e., betting that the price will decline). The stock, which was up some 40% since Ackman first announced he was shorting it in 2012, tumbled sharply after the news broke, ending about 7% down on the day’s trading. Herbalife defended itself in a statement on its site:

Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years.

The fight over Herbalife has been an oftentimes acrimonious battle between Ackman and other prominent investors who have bet that the stock would rise instead of falling. They include Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb (who held his stake for just two weeks) and George Soros (who trimmed his stake recently).

The contentious scene is eerily similar to Ackman’s six-year campaign against speciality insurance companies MBIA and Ambac back in 2007. Ackman eventually scored a $1.1 billion win on those deals, as documented in the book Confidence Game by former Bloomberg reporter Christine Richard.

Today’s news also comes seven months after Ackman threw in the towel on one of his biggest investments, a bullish bet on retailer JC Penney. That cost him nearly $500 million and dinged his reputation.



The high-profile jousting of billionaire hedge fund managers may look juvenile, but their antics are bringing the money flooding in. According to a recent Moody’s report, assets under management for activist funds—those that, like Ackman’s, put pressure on companies in an attempt to bring about changes that affect the share price—increased by 42% last year, to $93 billion from $65.5 billion in 2012.##1022|New York/London: Gold tumbled 1 percent on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth accelerated sharply, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

Bullion pared some early losses after benchmark 10-year Treasury yields gave back some gains after initially rising to a six-week high. Weaker U.S. equities after early advances also helped lift gold from its lows.

Employers added 175,000 jobs to their payrolls last month up from January`s 129,000 new positions, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent, as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.

"It`s a decent data point but who knows how valid it is because of the weather and so forth," said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of California-based Merk Funds, which has more than $400 million in currency mutual fund assets.

"Ultimately, the Fed is not interested in tightening any time soon because Yellen says she doesn`t think inflation is a problem," which boosts gold`s appeal as a hedge, he said.

Spot gold fell as much as 1.5 percent to a session low of USD 1,329.35 an ounce, and was last trading down 1 percent at USD 1,337.19 by 1:11 p.m. EST (1811 GMT).

U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery fell USD 14 to USD 1,337.80 an ounce, with trading volume about 20 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed.

The metal, seen as a safe haven, was still on track for a fifth straight week of gains, capitalising on gains made earlier in the week when tensions in Ukraine escalated.

"In the short term, given the better-than-expected data, and provided nothing happens in Ukraine over the weekend, gold could fall below USD 1,330," VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said.

On Friday, President Vladimir Putin rebuffed a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over Moscow`s military intervention in Crimea, saying that Russia could not ignore calls for help from Russian speakers in Ukraine.

Political tensions in top producer Russia and union strikes in second-biggest producer South Africa have triggered fears of supply constraints.

Platinum also notched its second straight weekly gain, up 2.6 percent. It edged up 39 cents on the day at USD 1,477.99.

There is no sign of an end to a six-week old platinum strike in South Africa. Wage talks collapsed earlier this week between the country`s powerful mineworker union AMCU and the world`s three top producers.

Silver fell 2.5 percent to USD 20.91 an ounce.##1023|Despite their surprisingly rapid recovery five years after being placed into government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be dissolved, if bi-partisan legislation announced today by the Senate banking committee eventually passes.

Under the bill, private capital would have to take the first 10 percent of all mortgage losses, effectively removing much of the firm federal backing that mortgage-backed securities repackaged by Fannie and Freddie have enjoyed.

The change represents a significant scale back of the government’s role in real estate finance.

In place of the government-sponsored enterprises, a Federal Mortgage Insurance Corp.–an entity similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.–will be formed. It is intended to ensure that financing remain available to all qualified borrowers. The FMIC will generate funds through user fees of 10 basis points per transaction, instead of using tax dollars.

“Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable,” Idaho Senator Mike Crapo said in a press release Tuesday morning.

The goal of the bill, more detail on which will be available later this week, is to eliminate Fannie and Freddie entirely, the statement said. The reform will “move us toward a stronger housing system that provides a balance between providing broad access to mortgages,” and avoiding future bailouts, according to Mr. Crapo.

The announcement was a surprise, even for close observers of real estate finance and policy, said Martin Schuh, vice president of regulatory policy at the commercial real estate finance council, a trade group. He was present at a briefing by the banking committee this morning in Washington D.C.

“This one caught everyone off guard,” he said. However, “the five years is pretty aggressive,” as a timeframe to wind down the multi-billion dollar enterprises, he warned.

His group was pleased that the bill will aim to treat Fannie and Freddie’s multifamily business as distinct from their single-family financing arms and will likely sell it off. “They specifically said they want to spin off [the multifamily] platforms… I see [the multifamily component] being attractive to investors tomorrow,” Mr. Schuh said.

Not everyone was quite so effusive.

“Today is a bad day,” Robert Ivanhoe, head of the real estate practice at Greenberg Traurig, told Mortgage Observer via email. “I am sure many people in the real estate industry are concerned about the winding down of the largest source of liquidity for multifamily apartment properties, by far, and how they will be financed in the future.” He predicted the change would destabilize the multifamily sector.

The bill does have bipartisan support. The unfortunately named Crapo teamed up with Democrat and banking committee chair Tim Johnson to craft the proposed legislation. But numerous sources said they do not expect the bill to make it through the House in its current form.

“I don’t think it survives much past this congress,” said Mr. Schuh. “But the important thing is that this is where all the future discussions will start.”

Recently published calculations from the Office of Management and Budget said the GSEs were on course to return $179 billion in profits to taxpayers in the next decade, if allowed to continue operating in conservatorship, making the attack on the agencies today even more surprising.

“There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy,” Senator Johnson said in the joint statement. But industry experts told Mortgage Observer that GSE reform was “presumed dead.”

Rick Lazio, former U. S. representative and real estate attorney with Jones Walker, agreed that the bill was a good starting point but would likely not make it into law intact. But he disagreed that the bill was a boon to the multifamily lending climate.

“Multifamily lenders overwhelmingly like the programs as they exist now,” he said. “They never lost a dime even through the worst of the downturn.”

Now, they will lose their federal guarantees, for the most part, even though their business was not what caused Fannie and Freddie to fall back on the government’s coffers.

The new rules would allow private label securities to be issued — with the goal of improving liquidity — but those will have lighter government backing, which kicks in only after the private originator has taken the required 10 percent loss. The securities would be sold via a unified platform and buyers would pay “risk-adjusted” prices for them, Mr. Lazio said.

“There will continue to be a federal role in multifamily lending,” Mr. Lazio said, but “there will be a limited guarantee.”

A representative for Fannie Mae said that due to the terms of their conservatorship, they could not comment on pending legislation.##1024|Empty##1025|Empty##1026|Empty##1027|China’s Alibaba, the largest e-commerce business in the world, announced yesterday it will float on an American stock market in what could be the biggest initial public share offering of all time.

Analysts reckon that Alibaba could seek to raise up to $15bn (£9bn) through the share sale in a move which could value it at between $150bn and $200bn. Details of the float may come as early as April.

At the top end, that would make Alibaba the world’s second most valuable internet company after Google, which is valued at $394bn. Amazon and Facebook both have stock market values of $172bn.

Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma and 17 friends in 1999, when it offered just 22 items on its website. It has grown to dominate Chinese e-commerce and Mr Ma’s wealth is estimated at $11.4bn. The firm employs more than 20,000 and is said to account for 70 per cent of all packages delivered in China.

The firm has not decided whether to float on the New York Stock Exchange or its more tech-heavy rival Nasdaq, but it has ruled out Hong Kong.

“Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,” the company said yesterday. “This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.”

More than $150bn-worth of merchandise changes hands on Alibaba’s different online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay put together.

The firm has nine major websites, which include consumers selling to consumers, businesses selling to consumers and to each other, global and domestic selling platforms, cloud computing and an electronic payment system.

China is second only to India in the number of internet users it has at 618 million.

McKinsey & Co has forecast its internet retail market will treble in size between 2011 and 2015 to $395bn.

In its latest figures, for the three months to September 2013, Alibaba’s quarter-on-quarter profits grew by 12 per cent to $792m on revenues up by 51 per cent at $1.78bn. In the same quarter Facebook’s profit was $422m.

Mr Ma, who owns a 7.4 per cent stake in the business, is understood to have favoured a US IPO over one in Hong Kong because it would enable he and his partners to maintain control of the business. Hong Kong Stock Exchange does not permit different classes of shares. But US markets have enabled people like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to keep control of their businesses after going public.

Alibaba said that it could still list shares in China at a later date. It said: “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”

The share sale could prove a massive $260m windfall for the investment banks chosen to advise on it, based on the usual 1.75 per cent underwiting fees they charge.

Alibaba is in discussions with Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley for lead underwriting roles. Most of the banks are likely to end up with at least some role in the share offer.

Yahoo owns a 24 per cent stake in Alibaba and Japan’s Softbank has a 37 per cent stake. They could both sell shares in the offer.

From China with smiles; Alibaba founder Jack Ma

Jack Ma, 49, was born in the city of Hangzhou and started as an English teacher and tour guide. On one of his trips he showed Yahoo founder Jerry Yang the Great Wall.

Alibaba took off as a way for Chinese firms to showcase their goods to the West, and Yahoo bought a $1bn stake.

Mr Ma stepped down as CEO last year but remains chairman. He has shifted his focus to improving health and education in China.

“If we don’t do this then young Chinese people will grow up with deep pockets but shallow minds,” he said.

Possible value of Alibaba: $200bn

The probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan was reported by Bloomberg, Reuters and the New York Times, citing unnamed sources.

The U.S. attorney’s office declined to either confirm or deny it was pursuing an investigation, and a spokesman said the office generally does not speak about investigations in the early stages.

General Motors spokesman Alan Adler said Tuesday night the company had no comment.

General Motors knew a decade ago of issues with the ignition switches of several popular models, including the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac’s G5 and Solstice, and Saturn’s Sky and Ion.

It only announced a recall in February. Nearly two weeks later, it expanded the number of affected vehicles from 780,000 to 1.4 million. It also disclosed additional deaths.

Federal law requires automakers notify a federal safety board within five days of discovering an issue.

GM’s new CEO, Mary Barra, recently defended the company’s actions in a letter to employees, saying it acted “without hesitation” and “well beyond” recommendations by technical experts. Another company official said GM’s review of the issue “was not as robust as it should have been.”

The criminal investigation would join reviews led by the National Transportation Safety Administration, Congress and an internal probe.

W Hong Kong is a five-star boutique hotel in

INTERVIEW

Hong Kong with 393 rooms. W Hong Kong combines the personality and style of an independent hotel with the reliability and attentive service of a major business hotel. It mixes cutting-edge design with local influences, creating a place to play and work by day or to mix and mingle by night.

You graduated from the Rutgers University in New Jersey in the US with an MBA

degree. Did you work on your degree while working in the hotel industry?

I worked and studied at the same time. I've always had the ambition of wanting to get

What motivated you to go into the hotel industry?

an MBA. When I was in my 30s, I was working in Shanghai as the Marketing Director at Hyatt. I thought it was the time to do it. I studied during the weekends and evenings. It was an Executive MBA and it lasted for 14 months. Professors would fly to Shanghai to give lectures. I won't say it was easy.

I was a typical young guy who didn't know what he wanted to do. I was rather naïve and

impressionable. I was interested in luxury brands in high-end retail and hotels. I went to work part- time in other luxury businesses but I didn't really like it because it was not what I had expected. The customers didn't seem grounded in most people's reality and were often simply interested in showing off. The next summer I went to work for Conrad Jupiters Casino on the Golf Coast in Australia as a steward. It was a terrible job! I remember I kept checking the clock hoping time would go faster. But the job did introduce me to the hotel business.

I was very lucky that the Chairman of my father's company was also the Chairman of

Conrad Jupiters. He gave me a recommendation to be interviewed by the GM, Ron Hughes. He was an inspiration and one of the people who got me excited about the hotel industry.

When I graduated with my Bachelor's degree, I looked for the best hotel group that

could provide young people with good career opportunities. I chose Hyatt because it had a good corporate training program which had a record of bringing young people into management jobs quickly. I started as a bellboy. When my fellow economics graduate friends came and stayed at the resort hotel on the weekends, I had to carry their bags... We all had a good laugh.

You worked for Hyatt for more than 15 years. Comparing Hyatt and W Hotel,

they have entirely different brand images and possibly different target markets. What prompted you to work for W Hong Kong?

I left Hyatt to join Starwood (Sheraton Tower in Singapore). These are quite different

companies. Hyatt's culture feels more like a family, whereas Starwood measures everything, including your performance, which made things less complicated and there were also no hidden agendas. W Hong Kong is located next to three big banks, and they are our corporate customers. Many bankers like to come to our hotel after work. It's quite funny that you see them standing next to guys who are from the creative industry who have tattoos and body piercings everywhere. I think they enjoy seeing the diversity of guests, many of whom are from outside of their normal circles.

Our core business is the corporate market. Of course, many of them are from

companies such as Apple and advertising agencies. We also cater to smaller MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibitions) as well as the high-end leisure market. At W, we have to be able to cater to the traditional markets and at the same time, we have to be able to do the "W" thing with DJ music and big parties, where we collaborate with the fashion industry, music industry, design industry, etc. It's a fun twist on a luxury hotel. But that fun twist can be easily seen as a gimmick if we don't have our basic service standards in place, we don't have the right to do the fun things at the W. We are a luxury hotel and we need to deliver.

To answer your question, when I started working for Hyatt after my corporate training

program, they put me in marketing. When I started as the GM of Westin Fuzhou, Fujian in China, they sent me to W, which is a very marketing-oriented company. I naturally drift towards marketing even though I am the GM...

You have spent nearly your entire career in Asia. What motivates you to stay in

Asia?

I feel like Asia is the center of the world somehow. I am Australian. When you work in

Australia, you are dealing with primarily domestic businesses. When you are young, you want to travel and see the world. So, it was relatively less interesting to me to stay in Australia. I was also intrigued by Asia; I have mostly worked in China and Hong Kong. It is so diverse and so different. I have experienced so many years in one region, I feel that I have adopted some of the Asian values. I am married to a Korean.

But I don't think you speak Korean...

It's true. I don't speak Korean and I am ashamed of it. But I have never worked in

Korea. I used to laugh at some of my colleagues who were married to someone from a different nationality yet couldn't speak more than a few sentences of their spouses native language, but I've become one of them.

You speak Mandarin and Cantonese (Chinese). Which aspects of the Chinese

culture do you enjoy the most? Which aspects of the culture do you find most difficult to adjust to?

One thing about the Chinese is that they have this sense of loyalty. If you were their

boss, even after 10 years, they would still think of you as their boss. They feel that they have this commitment to you. It's one of the things I admire the most. The Australian culture is so different. We are very direct and not very self-conscious. I think trying to be self-conscious is the most difficult thing to overcome. Initially in Asia I had difficulty reading between the lines. People didn't understand when I asked: "Why can't you just come out and tell me?"

I understand it now. It is an aspect of caring: The fact that you bother to read between

the lines as opposed to just expecting people to tell you. It takes a lot to adjust to the sensitive side of the culture; to be able to read people's inner thoughts without being told explicitly. I think I have learned a lot. It has made me a better person; a more understanding person.

What are the most challenging issues you are facing on your current position?

It took me over one year to adjust to the W brand concept, which means constantly

trying to invent new and different ideas. Although W offers a high-level style of service, the service is not always formal. Often, it is more casual. It is much easier to be formal. We often have events such as pool parties with 300 or 400 guests, loud music and dancing until midnight. At the same time, we have to adjust to other hotel guests' needs. For example, a banker tries to check in at 3:00 in the morning and sees a wild party in full swing. It's difficult to adjust at times.

What do you do at work that you enjoy so much you actually lose track of

time?

Being on time and planning well is important to being successful in our business. I don't

usually lose track of time. I think the only time I lose track of time is at the end of the day, say 7:00 PM, I start to work on things like answering e-mails, signing checks, etc. That's when I could lose track of time.

If you could relive one day of your life, which day would you choose?

It may sound like a bit of a cliché but it would be my wedding day. It was a great day!

In the eyes of your employees, what is the single most important quality you

should have?

I think I have to have understanding because it is difficult to make judgment calls when

you are leading several hundred employees. There are a lot issues going on everyday and you need to have feedback in order to understand the circumstances. It's not just being an understanding person; it is about having the information to know what is happening: What challenges my people are facing and how we can help them. I guess a lot of it is about talking to people at different levels in the organization. In our hotel we have an annual program in which every manager must work one day in a junior staff's position, and it could be housekeeping, a pastry chef, or an engineer in order to understand how difficult some of the jobs are.

In your opinion, what is the single best quality your employees can possess?

Curiosity! They need to be hardworking and disciplined, of course. But first of all, we like

What are the things that you do not like to do?

our employees to grow. The only way you can grow is taking interest and being curious, so that you can learn and grow. Also, people in hotels tend to form tight teams. They need to be curious outside of their teams. We always encourage people to take interest in how other departments work and learn how to work with them.

I don't like to do the same old thing over and over. That's something that has grown on

me since I joined the W brand. We always reinvent things. I encourage my people to do things differently internally and for our guests. You could do it in every hotel but at W, it is easier to have this approach. You have to look for something that will elevate the brand by capturing people's interest and generate profit at the same time. There is a trade off though. For example, when a team has been serving Japanese cuisine in the same restaurant, in the same way for 10 years, they become really good at it.

Some people say that a GM is not important to his frontline employees. Do

you agree?

If the GM is not important for the talent, something is wrong. The GM often makes the

final decisions because he provides the direction for the steering committee, although it may not be obvious. Maybe if the GM was more understanding and showed his face more frequently, he would make a better impression on his people. The GM must be relevant and important to his frontline employees.

If you must make a choice, would you do the things right or would you do the

right things?

Do the right things! As the GM, your role is to always be a figurehead and the leader.

What are your strengths and weaknesses?

You have to do yourself proud. Doing the right things is a matter of integrity. If you do the right thing, people will follow.

I am more of a big-picture person. I don't mind digging into details to find out what's

not working but I would much rather come up with new concepts and creative ideas. For me, if I have to study a spreadsheet trying to find out what's wrong, it's not my strength. It's my weakness.

As for my strengths, I am not afraid to take chances. Also, emotional intelligence is my

At work, what puts a smile on your face?

strength; I trust my gut feeling.

When our team comes up with an innovative idea to organize an event, and it's really

What puts a frown on your face?

working and you can feel the energy of the event. It puts a smile on my face.

People who are inconsiderate to guests and talents put a frown on my face. In the hotel

business, you do have to deal with difficult guests. I think it's ridiculous when people rely on their seniority or status trying to get things done. It will never work.

If you didn't know how old you are, how old would you like to be?

I am optimistic. I believe life is going to be better. I am 45 now. Of course, it's

How have you changed in the past five years?

wonderful to be young. I could do a lot of sports that I am not able to do anymore. But if I have to pick an age, I think 55 will be a great age as my career will be at another level. By that time, I will be doing something very interesting but I don't know what yet.

I've been humbled --- not that I was arrogant before. I moved out of marketing and

into operations. It has been five years since I became a GM. When I was the GM of Westin in China, there were young department heads who were willing to go anywhere in China in order to get better opportunities. I'd never come across anything like this before. It humbled me. I learned a lot!

Also, I went through a very tough leadership role that required operational focus in

China to open the hotel. Then I was given the opportunity to work in this amazing and stylish hotel here in Hong Kong. After working in two extremely different environments, I've learned to appreciate working with different people and gained some strength along the way. I've learned the reality of hotel operations. It doesn't just happen. It takes people to make it happen.

What advice would you offer to those who are inspired to become successful in

the hotel industry?

Be curious because it's too easy to keep doing what you are doing. If you keep doing

What's next?

the same thing, you won't learn as fast as you could. Ambitious young people who are waiting for being promoted tend to get frustrated. I was the same way. But sometimes you are not ready. So, I think you have to have faith. I think you have to take a chance. You can't be too conservative and afraid that your decision might be wrong. If you feel like you want to do it, you better get on and do it!

I'm not sure. I'm sure things will come along. I love the W brand. It's a great brand to

work for. I am looking forward for the "right challenge" within the brand. I'm addicted to the nontraditional hotel concept.

My next step will be something nontraditional but in a higher end hotel. The decisions

are more and more centrally controlled. We are here to execute the brand created by someone else for the benefit of the company. I would like to create something. I don't know what it is going to be yet. I am not saying that it will be the next thing I do. Maybe it will be something within the framework of a big company...

LONDON, March 18 — Britain shook up the Bank of England today, appointing two new deputy governors, breaking the all-male grip at the top, and a chief economist who has been critical of the banking industry.International Monetary Fund official Nemat Shafik will become the first woman to have a top policy role at the BoE since 2010 as its new deputy governor for markets and banking.

Ben Broadbent, up until now an external member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, will step up to become deputy governor for monetary policy.

In a third move, Andy Haldane, the BoE’s executive director for financial stability, is swapping jobs with chief economist Spencer Dale, who will lose his MPC seat from the start of June.

Dale had been seen as a favourite to become deputy governor. Haldane has been unusually outspoken for a central banker, criticising banks for trying to dodge regulation and addressing anti-capitalism protesters.

The changes — made by BoE Governor Mark Carney and the British government — are part of an overhaul at the Bank that Carney is pursuing to break down barriers between its monetary policy and bank regulation wings.

One of the biggest losers from the upheaval is markets director Paul Fisher who will have to give up his MPC seat to Shafik from August 1.

Fisher has been under fire from lawmakers over the BoE’s handling of alleged manipulation of London’s foreign exchange market.

“This shows the extent to which Mark Carney is reshaping the bank,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. “He’s serious about making reform, not only to the structure of the Bank ... but also in terms of its culture.”

Prior to Today’s announcement, Carney had overseen the appointment of outsiders to two other top positions at the Bank.

New deputy governors

Broadbent was formerly a senior economist at Goldman Sachs — Carney’s employer before he became a central banker — and he will succeed Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June.

Broadbent has said the failure of troubled banks to lend money to more efficient firms is one of the reasons behind Britain’s weak economic productivity since the financial crisis.Shafik — who holds Egyptian, US and British nationality — has a background in development economics, working at the World Bank and as the top civil servant at Britain’s overseas aid department, before becoming deputy managing director at the IMF.

She oversaw much of the IMF’s work in the turnaround programs for Greece and Portugal.

Shafik will be responsible for the BoE’s eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy — under which it amassed £375 billion (RM2.043 trillion) of government bonds — as well as reviewing the way the central bank gathers intelligence on markets which has come under scrutiny recently after claims that London traders manipulated key foreign exchange rates.

Since taking office in July, Carney has been keen to increase the number of women in senior roles at the BoE.

BNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments were a surprise, and would add “a degree of raised uncertainty” about when the central bank would start to raise interest rates from their record low 0.5 per cent.

Little is known about Shafik or Haldane’s views on monetary policy. Broadbent and Dale both voted against the BoE’s final expansion of asset purchases in July 2012, while Fisher was part of a dovish minority under former governor Mervyn King who wanted more asset purchases up until King’s departure in June.

Broadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor at the central bank.

He will be responsible for the BoE’s analysis of Britain’s economy, as well as bank notes.

Britain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the BoE’s Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank. Habgood is chairman of brewer Whitbread and publishing company Reed Elsevier .

Habgood succeeds David Lees, whose term expires on July 1. — Reuters##1042|Empty##1043|(Kitco News) - Gold prices are sporting good gains and hit a six-month high in early U.S. trading Wednesday. More safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish technical posture are prompting buying interest in the yellow metal. April gold was last up $14.40 at $1,361.10 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $11.10 at $1,361.00. May Comex silver last traded up $0.205 at $21.02 an ounce.

The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. The Group of Seven nations is set to release a statement later Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s likely that the G-7 will soon impose official economic and diplomatic sanctions on Russia. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. The Russian occupation of Crimea has been a bullish factor for the safe-haven gold market.

In other overnight news, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank’s monetary policy. The ECB has been battling tepid EU economic growth and deflationary concerns with a very stimulative monetary policy.

While gold and the raw commodity sector have fared well in the first quarter of 2014, the copper market has seen its price fall dramatically the past week. Comex copper futures prices hit a nearly four-year low Wednesday. Part of the selling pressure on copper comes from concerns about weakening Chinese economic growth. Crude oil prices have also been pressured in part by the concerns about a weakening Chinese economy. China is the world’s largest copper consumer. Copper is a major industrial metal worldwide. And many veteran stock market watchers say copper’s price move can be a harbinger of price action in the U.S. stock market. Concern about the health of the Chinese economy has weighed down the Asian and European stock markets this week. The fact gold has been able to make gains this week, despite the above circumstances, is impressive.

U.S. economic data due for release Wednesday is again light and includes the weekly MBA mortgage applications survey, the monthly budget statement, and the weekly DOE liquid energy stocks report.

The successful IPO of Twitter Inc in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's share price have fueled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including music-sharing service Spotify, lodging service and payments company Square.

King should also get a boost in its U.S. initial public offering from a surge in shares of digital coupon company Coupons.com Inc after it went public on Friday. Shares of Coupons.com doubled after being priced above the company's planned IPO range.

King Digital said it expected to price its IPO of 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 per share. At the top of this range, the company would be valued at about $7.6 billion.

The offering is scheduled to be priced on March 25 and the stock will start trading on March 26, two underwriters told Reuters.##1047|Why did this happen?

Beijing said Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98 billion in February.

The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8 billion in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $11.9 billion surplus. Exports fell 18.1 percent and imports jumped 10.1 percent.

“It’s hard to ignore a number that looks like that,” said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.

Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2.0 percent in February, down from 2.5 percent in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.

While authorities blame the country’s holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness.

The sell-off on Monday is “symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers”, he told Dow Jones Newswires.

Japanese GDP slower

In Japan the government said Monday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2 percent in the quarter to December and 1.5 percent through 2013, slower than first thought.

Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3 percent in October-December period and 1.6 percent over the year.

While the data still marked Japan’s best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.

After the merger of Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, the two together will have more than 1,700 stores in the United States, with approximately 23,000 employees and annual sales of about $3.5 billion. The deal totals out at $1.8 billion, with the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approving the transaction.

The two companies have been attempting to take each other over for months. Jos. A. Bank. sought to acquire Men’s Wearhouse for $48 a share, or $2.3 billion in a surprise bid in October, but dropped its offer by mid-November. In December, Men’s Wearhouse struck back with $1.5 billion bid that led to the current agreement.

Jos. A. Bank board chairman Robert N. Wildrick the final $65-per-share deal was satisfactory to his shareholders. Jos. A. Bank’s stock has never traded for the $65 per share, and over the past year—its strongest 12 months—it traded between $40 and $60 per share.

“The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men’s Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings,” Wildrick said in a statement.

As part of the deail, Jos. A. Bank agreed to scrap its agreement with Everest Holdings LLC to buy subsidiary Eddie Bauer.

Despite the contention between the two companies, Men’s Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert struck a conciliatory tone. “All of us at Men’s Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank’s talented employees,” he said.##1051|World stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 per cent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide. The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 per cent to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York. Prices on benchmark 10-year US Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 per cent.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.26 points or 0.43 per cent, to 16,382.46, the S&P 500 lost 5.11 points or 0.27 percent, to 1,872.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.229 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,324.994.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.3 per cent to $31.14 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6 per cent.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 per cent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.6 per cent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3 per cent. In the metals markets, London copper hit an eight-month low. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded down 1.36 percent to $6,690 a tonne. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest level since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

Brent crude was trading 97 cents down at $108.03.

Bloomberg reports Japan Says Bitcoin Not Currency Amid Calls for Regulation.

Japan’s government said Bitcoin isn’t a currency amid calls for its regulation a week after the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that was once the world’s biggest.



There is no law to define Bitcoin and relevant ministries are gathering information on it, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet said in a statement in response to questions from an opposition party lawmaker. Bitcoin transactions can be taxed, according to the statement obtained by Bloomberg News.



Japan isn’t the only country grappling with the regulation of Bitcoin amid reports of hacking into exchanges including Mt. Gox and concern that the virtual currency can be used for money laundering. In the U.S., states are wrestling with how digital-currency businesses could be regulated as money transmitters, while Russia has said Bitcoin is illegal under current law and Finland plans to treat it as a commodity.



The Japanese banking law doesn’t allow lenders to broker Bitcoin transactions or set up accounts for customers to store the digital assets, according to the statement. At the same time, current rules don’t prevent brokerages and asset managers from managing clients’ Bitcoins, it said.



“Japan’s government is falling behind the curve as Bitcoin grew rapidly over the past five years,” said Weizhou Yang, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Banks shouldn’t take risks to dabble in Bitcoin business. On the other hand, getting Bitcoin into funds may broaden the investment product base.”

DPJ’s Okubo



Democratic Party of Japan lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo, a former vice finance minister, called on the government to rectify the lack of regulation last week. Officials from the Finance Ministry, Financial Services Agency and Bank of Japan have said they’re not in a position to oversee Bitcoin.



“The authorities’ stance that they don’t have responsibility is disgraceful,” Okubo, who also used to work at Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview on Feb. 26. “We need to establish a legal system.”



Finance Minister Taro Aso said today that the government hasn’t decided whether to regulate Bitcoin. Earlier this week Aso, who also oversees the banking regulator, said it wasn’t clear yet whether Mt. Gox’s failure was a crime.



Singapore’s finance minister said last month that the central bank didn’t recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. China has stopped financial institutions from dealing in it, even as trading continues. Danish regulators are drafting a proposal for lawmakers in an effort to protect consumers and businesses from losses.

The answer to my question is yes, no, don't know, and it depends (dependent on what country you are in).



Newsweek Unmasks Bitcoin Inventor



Two day ago, Newsweek unmasked Satoshi Nakamoto, The Face Behind Bitcoin. It's a fascinating article, and one well worth a look.



Here's a paragraph that caught my attention.

Andresen, a Silicon Valley refugee in Amherst, Mass., says he worked closely with the person "or entity" known as Satoshi Nakamoto on the development of Bitcoin from June 2010 to April 2011. This was before the rise of today's multibillion-dollar Bitcoin economy, boosted last year by the unexpected, if cautious, endorsement of outgoing Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke, who said virtual currencies "may hold long-term promise."



Since then, Bitcoin ATMs have been cropping up across North America (with some of the first in Vancouver, British Columbia; Boston; and Albuquerque, N.M.) while the acceptance of Bitcoin has spread to businesses as diverse as Tesla, OkCupid, Reddit, Overstock.com and Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's aviation company, which has said it will blast people into space if they cough up enough Bitcoin.

Denial, Bizarre Media Road Chase



The Guardian reports Satoshi Nakamoto: man denies being bitcoin inventor amid media frenzy.

Dorian S Nakamoto, the Japanese-American man named as bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, has denied any link to the digital currency amid a farcical media chase through Los Angeles.



Nakamoto, 64, disputed a Newsweek cover story that on Thursday unmasked him as the “father of bitcoin”. His denial cast doubt on a putative scoop the magazine used to relaunch its print edition.



Nakamoto made the denial in an interview with the Associated Press after a day of near-slapstick scenes in which dozens of journalists pursued him and an AP reporter through the city, provoking a social media storm. “I got nothing to do with it,” he said.



A media posse continued seeking Nakamoto on Thursday night after he left the AP office in downtown LA where he and the reporter had sought refuge earlier in the day.



The Newsweek story, written by Leah McGrath Goodman, named him as “the mystery man behind the crypto-currency” which exploded in popularity in 2013 and supposedly made its founder worth $400m.



Satoshi Nakamoto, a name attributed to the currency’s founder, was widely deemed a pseudonym for an elusive, genius hacker. Numerous media organisations tried and failed to find him.



Newsweek, a venerable but struggling brand that had dropped its print edition in 2012, returned to newsstands this week trumpeting its 4,500-word story under the headline “Bitcoin’s Face”.



Within hours of publication dozens of journalists camped outside Nakamoto’s door, ringing the bell with no response, until their silver-haired, bespectacled quarry, dressed in a grey sports coat and striped shirt, emerged and said he wanted someone who spoke Japanese and would buy him lunch.



“I’m not involved in bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free lunch first. I’m going with this guy,” Nakamoto said, pointing at an AP reporter. “I’m not in bitcoin, I don’t know anything about it.”



Cameras followed as the pair headed in a Prius to a sushi restaurant. When reporters intruded they left and drove downtown, the pursuers tweeting all the way and making comparisons to the OJ Simpson highway chase in 1994.



The pair took refuge in the news agency’s downtown headquarters, leaving a media mob outside. In AP’s report, published late on Thursday, the alleged currency mastermind said his English was imperfect and that the Newsweek reporter misinterpreted him when he said was “no longer involved in that”.



“I’m saying I’m no longer in engineering. That’s it,” he said of the exchange. “And even if I was, when we get hired you have to sign this document, contract, saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that’s what I implied. It sounded like I was involved before with bitcoin and looked like I’m not involved now. That’s not what I meant. I want to clarify that,” he said.



McGrath Goodman, who spent two months researching the story, responded that she stood by her version of the exchange on his doorstep. “There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation – and his acknowledgment of his involvement in bitcoin.”

Followup Statement



Newsweek issued a followup statement in regards to the denials ... "Newsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article. Ms. Goodman’s reporting was motivated by a search for the truth surrounding a major business story, absent any other agenda. The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto’s role in the founding of Bitcoin."



I believe Newsweek has it correct. Leah McGrath Goodman did a fantsatic job of investigative reporting.

Colorado collected $1.4 million from a 10 percent sales tax on marijuana, as well as $416,690 from the state’s normal 2.9 percent sales tax, the Colorado Department of Revenue reported Monday.

Another $195,318 came in through an excise tax, which goes towards school construction in the state.

All in all, the month’s figures point to over $14 million in total retail marijuana sales for January.

The January figures, though, still fell below state predictions. Estimates from government sources for the first six months of 2014 fell above $190 million. Should January’s sales pace continue, that six-month period would yield $84 million.

A total of 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed January tax returns, according to the revenue department, with 24 being approved at the beginning of the month.

Yet as time passes, there will be room for growth. By the end of February, the state had approved 167 recreational marijuana businesses, though not all of them have received the local approval that is also needed for a shop to open.

Colorado lawmakers are still deliberating on how the recreational marijuana taxes will be used. Gov. John Hickenlooper has advocated using the money specifically for drug addiction treatment and youth prevention programs, while the Legislature has held out on making any decisions until more information about marijuana tax revenue is available.##1056|The battle to make off with Vivendi's SFR unit to create France's top telecoms company heated up Tuesday with a winner in the multi-billion-euro struggle likely to emerge within days.

The result could upend the French mobile sector by reducing the number of operators and ending the fierce competition that has brought considerable drops in prices to consumers.

Cable operator Numericable and the construction and telecoms group Bouygues have both offered more than 10 billion euros ($14 billion) for SFR, which boasts the country's second-largest mobile network and also provides home phone and computer services.

To sway opinion, Numericable's parent company Altice on Tuesday pledged to protect jobs and step up investments, while it turned up pressure by saying its offer would remain on the table only until Friday.

Altice has offered 10.9 billion euros and a 32 percent stake in the new company Numericable-SFR to Vivendi, which has signalled its interest in unloading SFR to focus on its media holdings that include Universal Music.

The company has said it is "convinced that its offer is the most attractive" for Vivendi as well as the entire telecommunications sector.

Numericable does not have a mobile network, so its merger with SFR would leave the sector with four operators.

Altice said its offer would also be best for accelerating development of France's fibre-optic and high-speed 4G mobile networks.

Bouygues Telecom's offer is similar in financial terms: 10.5 billion euros but 46 percent of the new company.

However it has scored political points by making commitments to not only guarantee jobs, but also bring back some of the client service jobs that had been outsourced abroad.

Low prices 'irreversible right'



But its success would result in a reduction from four to three operators, an eventuality that has worried consumers, who have seen mobile prices drop by nearly a third since a fourth network began operating in 2011.

"Going from four to three operators is something which could worry us if no guarantees are put in place," the head of the consumer protection group UFC Que Choisir, Alan Bazot, has told AFP.

Bouygues Telecom has sought to take the sting out by offering to sell its current network infrastructure to Free, the newest operator which is still struggling to build its own network.

The head of France's competition authority, Bruno Lasserre, has said that the offer increases the chances that a merger between Bouygues Telecom and SFR would receive regulatory approval.

Free, which still rents capacity from the leading network Orange but must soon give up this arrangement, has endorsed a Bouygues-SFR tie-up.

The government's industrial redevelopment minister, Arnaud Montebourg, has tried to calm consumers' concerns.

"The time has come for a renaissance in the telecoms sector. I don't believe this will be to the detriment of consumers," he said on RTL radio, saying the drop in prices for mobile calls is an "irreversible right".

Analysts tend to favour the Bouygues tie-up, which would temper the price competition that has eroded profits and reduced funds available for investments.

"It seems to us that there are more synergies between SFR and Bouygues than SFR and Numericable," said one Paris-based analyst.

But a bidding war could get out of hand, the analyst warned.

"Bouygues and Numericable both need this deal and could be led into making an offer that is too high."

Bouygues shares were down 0.26 percent on Tuesday to 32.60 euros, but have climbed by nearly 14 percent since the beginning of the month.

Numericable's share price fell 2.85 percent Tuesday to 24.19 euros, and has dropped by about a fifth since the beginning of the month.##1057|Metro-North worker dies after being hit by train while working on tracks in East Harlem

The employee was struck by the Hudson line train en-route to Poughkeepsie just before 1 a.m.



Worker was on the tracks at Park Avenue and East 106th Street in East Harlem

Man was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was later pronounced dead



New York's Metro-North Railroad says one of its employees was struck and killed by a train while working on tracks in Manhattan.

The nation's second-busiest railroad says it happened at 12:54 a.m. Monday at Park Avenue and East 106th Street.

The employee was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. His identity wasn't released.

Dead: A Metro-North employee was struck and killed by a train in Manhattan while doing work on the tracks Monday morning, MTA officials confirmed

About 50 passengers were aboard the train, the 12:47 a.m. from Grand Central Terminal bound for Poughkeepsie.

Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the 50 passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train resuming their trip at 2:17 a.m.

The death is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police.

Service was restored before the morning rush.

Timeline: The Hudson Line train departed Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m. en route to Poughkeepsie. Approximately 50 passengers on the train were safely moved to another train and resumed their trip at 2:17 a.m.

Metro-North serves 281,000 riders a day in New York and Connecticut.

It has experienced a spate of problems in the last year, including a derailment in the Bronx that killed four passengers and injured 71.

Last May, a derailment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, injured 76.

In the same month, track foreman Robert Luden, 52, was killed in Connecticut after a student rail controller put the track where Luden was working back into service without approval.

##1058|Empty##1059|An independent Scotland would need to ensure a formal currency union arrangement to keep the pound was completely viable, like being pregnant, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned.

The central bank chief made the unusual comparison speaking before the Treasury select committee about the implications of Scottish independence and potential risks if voters choose to break away from the UK in September's referendum.

"Viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant in the sense that you can't be half viable in a currency union. You need all the components of a currency union. You have to look at the whole package," he told MPs.

Carney argued that there would be "advantages" to an independent Scotland if it became part of a EU banking union but it would be "half-viable" as it would not have a common deposit guarantee scheme and lender of last resort negotiations would have to be made.

This comes after Carney warned in a speech made in Scotland that a "successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty", while the British government argued that an independent Scotland would be handing over control of its interest rates and borrowing levels to a foreign nation.

However Carney warned that the Scottish economy is "more volatile" and that there was a "distinct possibility" that banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland would be forced to move their headquarters out of an independent Scotland.

Carney suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis.

He told MPs: "There's famously a no-bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but when push came to shove with risks in the periphery that was not fully credible because the spillover effects of not bailing out, or not assisting in some sort of arrangement, were judged, in the teeth of a global crisis, to be too great to risk and so there were extraordinary efforts made, and appropriate efforts, made by European officials to avoid that.

"The issue for the rest of the UK would be would it be credible, I'm not predicting this but one has to plan for contingencies, would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?

"If it is not credible then the structure of the currency union obviously is less than perfect but it is also taking on a contingent liability or responsibility to the rest of the UK balance sheet. So, these are all issues that have to be thought through in advance."

The Bank of England governor confirmed to SNP committee member Stewart Hosie that Scotland and the rest of the UK's economies are "highly correlated", which is "beneficial" for a currency union arrangement.

Carney dismissed suggestions that he thought a currency union was a bad idea.

"I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments," he said.

"At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate. When it was suggested that he had created a "less than optimistic picture", he told MPs his intention was to draw attention to the underlying economic issues.

A fierce argument has erupted over the prospects of an independent Scotland keeping the pound in a currency union arrangement with the rest of the UK after three main political parties said that it would not be possible.

Chancellor George Osborne ruled out any chance of an independent Scotland joining a formal currency union, in a move which was backed by Labour and the Lib Dems.

Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon dismissed the warnings as the "Westminster establishment" trying to lay down the law to Scotland and warned the move would backfire on the pro-Union parties.

Osborne said: "The pound is one of the oldest and most successful currencies in the world. I want Scotland to keep the pound and the economic security that it brings,"

"The UK works, in good times and also in bad. Together we have faced the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression.

"But we avoided the economic collapse other nations around us in Europe faced because together, we had the strength to confront our problems and overcome them."

Carney told the Treasury select committee earlier today that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.##1060|Lake Effect's Mitch Teich speaks with Dr. Chukuka Enwemeka.

The rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been beset by difficulties at a number of levels, from the website troubles as health exchanges were launched last year, to the news yesterday that only about half of uninsured adults (approximately 4.5 million adults, the population of Spain) have even investigated getting insurance through health exchanges.

And in the middle of all of this is the insurance industry, which is now being told to do much of its business in a new way. For a second straight year, the UW-Milwaukee College of Health Sciences is convening a leadership healthcare forum to discuss healthcare reform, this year with an emphasis on the insurance industry.

Dr. Chukuka Enwemeka, the dean of the College of Health Sciences, hopes the forum will educate those involved in the health insurance industry what they should be doing in within the Affordable Care Act. He says many people involved are misinformed.

Enwemeka considers this process as “teething pains” for the government. Congress was hesitant in passing this act because they were entering into uncharted waters.

Enwemeka says that while the act's goal is to make sure everyone has health insurance and to make it easy to find health insurance, those who already have health insurance are not necessarily using it because of high co-pays. He hopes the forum will encourage people to look into health care rather than turn away.

“Everyone will influence how things will evolve,” Enwemeka says.

The college’s annual leadership healthcare forum is on Wednesday March 12th at the Italian Conference Center in Milwaukee.##1061|Inflation slowed to just 1.1 percent annually in February, according to the Consumer Price Index published Tuesday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Core inflation, which factors out increases in food and energy prices and is generally less volatile, was higher, at 1.6 percent.

Headline inflation, at 1.1 percent, was slower than December's 1.5 percent and January's 1.6 percent.

Food prices rose 0.4 percent in February, accounting for more than half of the overall price level rise in February, according to the BLS.

At just above 1 percent, inflation, as measured by the CPI, is roughly half of the 2-percent goal that the Federal Reserve has adopted.

Although some investors and Fed analysts have suggested that recent months' data show labor markets tightening, inflation remains below where Fed officials expect it would be in the case of a strengthening economy.

Fed officials, meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington to discuss the central bank's monetary policy, have said it "likely will be appropriate" to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate, which is currently 6.7 percent, falls well below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent target.

Other measures of inflation the Fed monitors tell a similar story — that prices are rising only slowly.

For instance, the personal consumption expenditures chain price index, taken from a different survey than the CPI, also showed core inflation low in January, at just 1.1 percent. The Fed views core PCE inflation as more informative about the underlying trend of inflation than other gauges.

With inflation slowing, rather than picking up, the Fed is less likely to take steps to retreat from its efforts to ease the money supply and signal earlier interest rate hikes.##1062|A Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train early Monday morning while working on the tracks, according to report from CBS.

A woman, Kathryn Mayorga, filed a lawsuit last week against the Portuguese athlete, saying Ronaldo coerced her into signing a settlement and nondisclosure agreement about an alleged assault in 2009, reports CNN. Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room while she repeatedly screamed. The lawsuit describes Ronaldo apologizing immediately after, "stating he was sorry, he was usually a gentleman," and confirming to his representatives that Mayorga said "no" and "stop."

Ronaldo called the claim "fake news," and threatened to sue a German magazine that reported on Mayorga's allegations. Mayorga reported the incident in 2009, but Las Vegas officials said they had no suspect in the case. "At the time the report was taken, the victim did not provide detectives with the location of the incident or suspect description," the police department said in a statement, noting that the case has been reopened with new details. Mayorga says she was encouraged by police not to publicly name Ronaldo to avoid retaliation.

Mayorga says she received $375,000 for her silence, but is seeking to void the settlement and nondisclosure agreement in order to speak about the alleged assault. "The psychological trauma of the sexual assault, the fear of public humiliation and retaliation and the reiteration of those fears by law enforcement and medical providers left plaintiff terrified and unable to act or advocate for herself," claims the lawsuit.

Though American Eagle had a better-than-expected fiscal third quarter with a 5.6% increase in revenue from third quarter 2012, the retailer expects a 7% decline in sales from the previous year during the holiday season according to a business report provided by the company in January.

Many retailers suffered during the holiday season slump which saw consumer foot traffic down 17.7% in December compared to last year despite industry wide promotional discounting.

The sudden departure of American Eagle CEO Robert Hanson in January along with the bleak earnings report hasnt helped shore up confidence in the company whose EPS is down 53% to $0.26 according to Yahoo! Finance.

New Delhi, Mon, 17 Mar 2014 ANI

New Delhi, Mar. 17 (ANI): An Indian Navy ship involved in search operations for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane on Monday arrived at the naval base in Port Blair.

India on Sunday had put on hold its search for the missing aircraft, at the request of the Malaysian government, which wants to reassess the week-old hunt for the Boeing 777 that is suspected of being deliberately flown off course

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

Malaysia briefed envoys from nearly two dozen nations and appealed for international help in the search for the plane along two arcs stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the far south of the Indian Ocean.

India had initially been combing two areas-one around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and a second, further west, in the Bay of Bengal.

Both operations have been suspended, but may yet resume, Indian defence officials said.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage hardened further after it was confirmed the last radio message from the cockpit - an informal "all right, good night" - was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

But police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened aboard the jetliner unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to the borders of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

The controversy marks a major test of Carney’s leadership after he took over the BoE less than a year ago and began overhauling its monetary policy, communications regime and structure. Market prices are driven by a combination of fundamental data and sentiment and from a sentiment point of view; this probably won’t bode well for the pound.

Sterling came under pressure yesterday afternoon as Charlie Bean, the deputy governor for monetary policy warned that a further rise in the pound would hinder efforts to boost exports and rebalance the economy. His comments will dampen expectations of a rate hike any time soon and that will have a negative impact on the pound. According to Mr. Bean the BoE will first need to see sustainable growth before they change monetary policy i.e. a pickup in business investment, an improvement in productivity and an increase in exports.

European officials started preparing sanctions against Russia yesterday as diplomats acknowledged their efforts had failed to persuade Russia to stand down in the Ukraine. At this stage it’s difficult to understand what kind of affect the sanctions will have on trade and the currency but we can certainly expect some volatility in weeks to come.

Remember a number of EU member states have become dependent on Russian gas and money. Russia supplies 40% of German gas imports and almost 5% of German manufacturing exports go to Russia. Trade sanctions if imposed by Europe could have a negative impact on the euro. The Europeans are on their own here, after 4 years of austerity the British economy is simply too frail to take a principled stand against armed aggression.

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, confirmed yesterday that the Fed will continue to taper at its present rate of $10Bn a month. At this point, the Fed is still trying to determine whether the economy is showing signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or because of fundamental obstacles to growth.

More than likely it’s the weather which means that this could be a good time to buy dollars. The outlook for the economy still looks favourable, unemployment is high but it’s coming down, the budget deficit is declining, the housing market is showing signs of improvement and interest rates are still low which is great for stimulation. According to the White House, the US economy is expected to expand by 3.1% this year and by 3.4% in 2015.##1070|Empty##1071|The search for the missing plane has continued over the Andaman Islands [GETTY/AP]

India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea

Sources have confirmed that sabotage is a real possibility with military-radar tracking evidence suggesting Flight MH370 could have been flown hundreds of miles off course towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, north-west of Malaysia. A senior Malaysian police official said inquiries were focusing increasingly on the theory that someone who knew how to fly a plane deliberately diverted the Boeing 777, with 239 people on board, off its intended course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A U.S official in Washington said that investigators are examining the possibility of "human intervention" in the plane's disappearance, adding it may have been "an act of piracy." The official, who wasn't authorised to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, also said it was possible the plane may have landed somewhere. India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea as search efforts continue to expand. Two Indian air force reconnaissance planes flew over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after they and two naval ships and two coast guard vessels scoured the surrounding seas without finding evidence of the plane. A spokesman declined to give details about the rest of the search operation, including the use of technologies such as the heat sensors aboard the Dornier planes. The Andaman and Nicobar archipelago stretches south of Myanmar and contains 572 islands covering an area of 447-by-32 miles. Only 37 are inhabited, with the rest covered in dense forests.

As the search for the missing plane entered its seventh day, a senior Malaysian police official said: "What we can say is we are looking at sabotage, with hijack still on the cards." Two sources said an unidentified aircraft believed to be Flight MH370 was following a route between navigational waypoints - indicating it was being flown by someone with aviation training - when it was last plotted on military radar off Malaysia’s northwest coast. The position suggested the plane was flying toward India's Andaman Islands, which lie between the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. That would mean it flew for up to five hours after the last contact and officials are now likely to have to dramatically extend the current 27,000sq nautical mile search area out into the vast Indian Ocean. Malaysian police have previously said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. The comments by the three sources are the first clear indication that foul play is the main focus of official suspicions in the Boeing 777's disappearance. Earlier reports that two passengers boarded the plane with stolen passports sparked speculation the plane could have been hijacked by terrorists, but the theory weakened after Malaysian authorities determined that one of them was an Iranian seeking asylum in Europe. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said: "We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group.” Speaking at a press conference this morning, the country’s transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said they were looking into the possibilty one of the pilots may have been involved. He also said the plane’s tracking systems could have been turned off by someone intentionally, or under duress. In the week that the plane has been missing, several other theories have been put forward.

The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were “Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace. Retired British Airways pilot Alastair Rosenschein believes Flight MH 370 has plunged into the Indian Ocean half way between Madagascar and Australia. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he claimed the Malaysian jetliner is around 5,000 miles away from where rescuers are looking in the South China Sea after flying on a course set by the pilots before the crew passed out from a drop in cabin pressure. He said: "The initial reaction for pilots in that case would be to put on oxygen masks immediately. "However, had they failed to do that the next option would be to turn off the airway in order to do a rapid descent. "Without the oxygen masks they would have passed out within a few seconds. "That would have left the aircraft on autopilot heading in whichever direction they had turned the aircraft on the autopilot. "I'm suggesting that they would have made that initial heading a reciprocal one back towards Kuala Lumpur airport. "That doesn't mean they turned the aircraft directly and exactly toward Kuala Lumpur airport it could quite happily have been a parallel track with the airway.

"With the fuel on board that would put the aircraft finally as it ran out out of fuel, with everybody unconscious on board, somewhere around the mid-Indian Ocean which is thousands of miles away from where they're looking at present. "The worst case scenario for the location of the aircraft would be half-way between Madagascar and Australia, a very very difficult area to search and of course a huge area." Satellite images released by Chinese authorities earlier this week appeared to show the outline of a plane's wreckage floating in between the Gulf of Thailand the South China Sea. But Malaysia's transport minister said the pictures do not show the wreckage of the missing aircraft and were released by mistake and a Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency surveillance plan had been dispatched to the area and had found nothing. Mr Hussein also dismissed a report by the Wall Street Journal that MH 370 kept flying for several hours after it lost contact, claiming teams from Boeing and Rolls Royce confirmed engine data cited in the article was inaccurate.

He added that all the necessary pre-flight checks and maintenance work had been carried out on the plane and dispelled rumours police have searched the homes of the pilots. Some 57 ships and 48 aircraft from 13 countries are now taking part in the operation, which covers 27,000 square nautical miles from the South China Sea to India's territorial waters. Satellite pictures of the Gulf of Thailand have now been uploaded to the web and members of the public are being urged to help the search from home. Colorado based company DigitalGlobe have uploaded the images to tomnod.com and are asking volunteers to point out “anything that looks interesting, any signs of wreckage or life rafts." Several witnesses have come forward, claiming to have spotted the plane. New Zealand worker Mike McKay claimed to have witnessed the Malaysia Airlines plane "come down" in flames. Speaking to ABC News, he said: "I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right. "I observed (the plane) burning at high altitude. "While I observed the burning (plane) it appeared to be in one piece."

Indonesia and Thailand, which lie on either side of the northern part of the Malacca Strait, have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace. A senior military officer who had been briefed on the investigation said the missing aircraft had made a detour to the west after communications with civilian authorities ended. "It changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude. It made it into the Malacca Strait," the officer said. A non-military source familiar with the investigations said the reported detour was one of several theories and was being checked. If the plane had made such a detour it would undermine the theory that it suffered a sudden, catastrophic mechanical failure, as it would mean it flew at least 350 miles after its last contact with air traffic control. In the absence of any concrete evidence to explain the plane's disappearance, authorities have not ruled out anything. Witnesses have come forward, claiming to have spotted the plane. Mike McKay, a New Zealander working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Thailand, sent an email Vietnamese authorities saying he spotted what could have been a burning plane 200 miles southeast of Vung Tau. Police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were “Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace. Another possibility being looked into by authorities is that one of the pilots committed suicide. John Brennan, head of the US Central Intelligence Agency said: “I think you cannot discount any theory.”

Li spoke to the South China Morning Post hours after mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba said it had picked New York after months of wrangling with Hong Kong regulators over its management structure that the Securities and Futures Commission said breached its "one shareholder, one vote" governance rules.

"Everything has a cost. Our persistence has a cost too," Li told the Post, but added that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing would continue with the review of its existing listing rules - which began after a stalemate with Alibaba last autumn - even though the deal was now dead.

We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant

Charles Li Xiaojia

"The reform review in the HKEx will not stop because Alibaba has decided to list elsewhere," Li said. "We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant, but Alibaba's proposal has propelled the management to review our operating model. The eventual loss may be even larger if we don't undergo reforms [of the] listing regime."

However, the stock exchange chief was careful to back regulation that many international investors - and the SFC - say define Hong Kong as a respected market in which to trade and invest.

"We feel proud of Hong Kong as we ensure that our rule of law and investor protection remain intact," Li said.

Hangzhou -based Alibaba, led by former English teacher Jack Ma Yun, said yesterday that it would begin the process for an initial public offering in New York.

Hong Kong's regulators had rejected Alibaba's wish for an amendment to the city's listing rules to accommodate a partnership structure that gives Ma and other senior managers the right to nominate a majority of board members, despite owning only around 10 per cent of the firm's stock. Exchanges in the US allow such dual-class structures. The other major stock holders in Alibaba are Yahoo and Softbank.

Alibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since Facebook's US$16 billion IPO in 2012.

The estimate is based on the firm's current expected market value of between US$100 billion and US$120 billion.

Alibaba said on its corporate blog yesterday that the steps towards a US IPO would make the firm "more global and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals".

Investment banks, including Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, are said by market participants to be the lead managers for the Alibaba listing.

The US listing will provide a swift means for Alibaba to lower the cost of capital since the deal-hungry internet firm has spent more than US$3 billion in a buying spree over the past year.##1073|Innovation holds key to China's economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, Premier Li Keqiang said last week in the government work report at the ongoing annual session of the country's top legislature. From high-tech products to cutting-edge scientific research and development, China's drive to shift its role from "the factory floor of the world" to an inventor and innovator has become a hot topic at home and abroad. Xinhua reporters carried out a series of interviews around the world to sketch out how the foreigners think of the the China-developed products and the related developments. DIALOGUE 1 Xinhua: Do you have anything developed and produced in China? How do you feel about them? "I don't know it was made by China," said a Californian commuter Passti, referring to the BYD E-bus she is on. "It's very comfortable, very clean and quiet, I love it ... It would be perfect if it has more space." The bus driver Derrick Smith also expressed his fondness for the bus. "I actually like driving BYD's electric buses over any gas-fueled or CNG-fueled buses. They ride a lot smoother, cleaner; they feel a lot lighter, and the driver area is more comfortable," he said. Beside electronic busses, China-designed cellphones have also edged into the Western society. "Of course I use the ZTE phones. I am proud to use it," said Nicklas Sivander, sales director of ZTE's Sweden office. "It has all the features I need ... I also control my whole home music system with this smartphone. So it's my everyday tool." DIALOGUE 2 Xinhua: What are the competitive edges and weaknesses of Chinese manufactured products compared with their international competitors? "The (Chinese) technology is very good," said Brenden Riley, sales chief of BYD's North American office. "My only concern with Chinese new tech is that I don't find the design so pretty yet, but that will come with time." Chinese-made products "need to be cooler, prettier," Riley noted. "The life cycle of high-tech products is short, so the international competition requires a different way, more localized ... I think it's coming but just not there yet." However, to Sivander, the tempting quality and price of Chinese mobiles made them successful in local market. "We have all the features that any advanced smartphone has on the market right now," he said, "The good thing with this phone is we can offer it with attractive price here in north Europe, which means that we are competing with the major player but giving more value for money." "What we need to improve our performance here is to work on our brand, to inform the consumers that ZTE exists and has designed proper products," Sivander suggested. DIALOGUE 3 Xinhua: How is Chinese scientific groups' papers publication doing, in terms of originality, forwardness and growing rate? According to data provided by Natasha D. Pinol, senior communications officer of science, almost 70 published original research papers have listed authors from China in 2010. But to 2013, the number has rocketed to 104. Dr. Nick Campbell, executive editor of Nature, also said increasing research papers from China have been published in his journals in recent years. "From 2008 to 2012 we saw the contribution from Chinese authors to papers in Nature rapidly increase to 2.5 percent in 2012 compared to 1.5 percent in 2008," he said. "Over the same period China' share of papers in all Nature journals were more than doubled, from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent." The editor told Xinhua that the Chinese Academy of Sciences has replaced the University of Tokyo in January 2013 as the largest institutional contributor to Nature in the Asia-Pacific. "All indications at this stage are that this pattern of growth has continued," said Campbell. "Our criteria for selection focus on original findings of outstanding significance that are of interest to an interdisciplinary readership... in broad terms, an improvement in the number of Chinese researchers that are meeting these exacting standards in their papers." DIALOGUE 4 Xinhua: China has made considerate investment in scientific R&D. Can you tell us how is China's research output compared with that of the West? What should be underlined in China's reform of its scientific and research system in your opinion? "Government support for science clearly helps to speed scientific advancement," said Pinol. "Adequate federal support for research and development is essential to innovation. China's leaders clearly recognize the connection between increased government support for science and the discoveries that drive economic prosperity." As for Campbell, he said research-output efficiency is not a trivial thing to measure. "We would never suggest that you should use publications in Nature journals," he said. "Nonetheless we can at least look at how countries do relative to their total number of researchers. These figures show that China's contribution to these journals is lower than smaller Asia-Pacific countries such as Australia and Singapore, and the largest global contributors to Nature journals, the USA and UK." However, the executive editor argued that there is no perfect way of organizing a research funding system. "Many nations are struggling to strike an appropriate balance bet," he said. "Like all nations, China needs to continue to focus on improvements that reward high quality research outcomes and help leverage that research to ultimately make a substantive positive impact on broader society."##1074|NEW DELHI — When Shweta Singh wanted to become a pilot in India 20 years ago, she had to first persuade her parents to let her pick an uncommon profession for women, then deal with unwelcoming male colleagues in the cockpit.

Comments from some central bankers and their advisors did give the markets a little bit of volatility yesterday.

Charlie Bean, the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, spoke yesterday to a group of business leaders in Darlington. When asked about sterling he said that “any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports”. He also said that exports have been disappointing, although it may be “only a matter of time” before trade begins to improve as those economies we enjoy significant trade ties with improve.

These comments were good enough for a good 0.5% off losses in GBPUSD and briefly pressed sterling down to below the 1.20 level in GBPEUR. There may have been some sterling selling as well ahead of Carney’s testimony in front of the Treasury Select Committee due this morning. Carney – alongside Paul Fisher, David Miles and Martin Fisher – will testify in front of MPs on the changes to forward guidance outlined in the recent Quarterly Inflation Report. However, the pointed questions will more likely revolve around accusations that the Bank of England was complicit in some form of abuse in currency markets. We would wager that this will be Carney’s most uncomfortable appearance in front of TSC.

Elsewhere, EUR was weakened following a report in the Telegraph that a German think tank is calling for a “QE-style blitz” in order to avert a slip into deflation. EURUSD peeled back from 1.39 to the mid-1.38s as Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, called for EUR60bn of bond purchases each month until the threat of deflation was taken care of. Christian Noyer, Bank of France member at the ECB, echoed sentiment that the euro was too strong at the moment but that the Eurozone did not face deflation. The calls for the ECB to make amends to its policy are increasing in volume and urgency.

A function of this is we are looking for GBPEUR to rebound from these lows through the week.

As was expected, the Bank of Japan have decided to hold policy as is this month. This will not last in our eyes and believe that Japan’s progression through 2014 will be marked by a strong stumble in growth and confidence, following the imposition of an increase in sales taxes that will kill off any recent improvements in consumer spending dynamics. Growth and spending have already been brought forward into Q1, to avoid the April 1st deadline, and then fall from a cliff afterwards. Growth yesterday morning was shown to have been around ¼ of expectations in Q4 of last year. The Bank of Japan is likely to ride into the monetary battle with further purchases of Japanese government debt and Exchange Traded Funds in order to further weaken the yen, promote liquidity and generate stock market gains.

Notably, respondents’ home price expectations climbed significantly in February—with 50 percent saying home prices will go up in the next year—following a measurable downturn in January, while the share of those who believe it is a good time to buy a home ticked up by 3 percentage points.

At the same time, those who believe that it would be easy to get a mortgage dropped 7 percentage points from January’s all-time survey high of 52 percent. Additionally, the share of respondents who say the economy is on the wrong track increased 3 percentage points to 57 percent in February, following a four-month decline. Despite a decrease in optimism across some of the indicators last month, consumer attitudes remain in generally positive ranges.

“Similar to the noisy economic and housing data published over the past few months, we’ve seen a corresponding increase in volatility in our survey results, particularly for home price expectations and perceptions about the ease of getting a mortgage,” says Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. “Weather may have played a role, as suggested by a 6 percentage point jump over the past two months in the share of consumers who say their household expenses are significantly higher than a year ago. This response would be consistent with higher home heating costs. Despite the volatile month-to-month changes, we believe that the housing recovery is continuing, but is not yet robust.”

The legislators have a total of 107 questions about the recall, which covered six models, sold from the 2003 through 2007 model years. At root is an ignition switch that can move out of its normal ‘on’ position while driving—leading to the loss of power (and steering and braking assist, in some cases) along with a risk that airbags won’t deploy in a resulting accident.

In all, the issue has been attributed in at least 31 crashes and 13 deaths, in the following models that were recalled last month:

The procedure of such a Congressional investigation was laid out by the Tread Act of 2000, which was a piece of auto-safety legislation prompted by the high-profile recall that year, of Ford Explorer SUVs equipped with Firestone tires. “The committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain on the road,” said U.S. Representative Henry Waxman, the top-ranking Democrat of the committee.

NHTSA has already opened a separate investigation into the matter—checking that GM reported the issue in what would be considered a timely manner—and GM has provided such a chronology.

GM was allegedly first aware of the issue in 2004, when it concerned a 2005 Chevy Cobalt; and according to the Wall Street Journal a GM engineer proposed a new design that could handle additional weight from a key ring (part of the issue); although the revised design was later canceled.

However as lawyers set GM in their sights, one legal issue could get in the way: Under the restructuring that occurred when the “old GM” became the “new GM,” the automaker’s product liability only extends back to July 2009; claims on issues prior to that would need to be addressed through bankruptcy court.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors are considering a criminal probe regarding the matter. And a Senate inquiry? While one hasn’t yet been initiated, that could happen in coming days.

While Mt. Gox did not provide further information about the attack, which reportedly exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, a group of hackers claimed Sunday that they broke into Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ personal blog, and found a discrepancy in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins Mt. Gox claimed were stolen in February's security lapse.

According to a report from Forbes, the hackers gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Karpeles and posted a message, claiming that the exchange still had access to some of the bitcoins that Karpeles had reported stolen.

The hackers uploaded a series of files, including a spreadsheet of anonymous user accounts with details of bitcoin balances, Karpeles' home address, and a screenshot allegedly verifying the hackers' access to the data. In addition, the hackers also posted a 716MB zip file claimed to contain stolen data from Mt. Gox servers. Here is the link to the data on Pastebin.

“First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,” the hackers wrote. “It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed… Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with f***ing Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.”

The data posted by the hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, claiming it had lost 750,000 customer bitcoins, in addition to 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.

While the authenticity of Sunday’s database dump has not yet been confirmed, some Reddit users said they had found that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, CNET reported.##1082|News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services##1083|##1084|KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The search for the missing Malaysian jet pushed deep into the northern and southern hemispheres Monday as Australia took the lead in scouring the seas of the southern Indian Ocean and Kazakhstan -- about 10,000 miles to the northwest -- answered Malaysia's call for help in the unprecedented hunt.

French investigators arriving to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals -- but investigators say the Malaysian airliner's communications links were deliberately severed ahead of its mysterious disappearance more than a week ago.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.

Malaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots' home on March 9, the day after the flight.

Investigators haven't ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight's last words -- "All right, good night" -- to ground controllers.

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots -- or someone else -- without the other pilot's knowledge.

Malaysia's government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

Over the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 A1/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.

The northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan -- all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.

An official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to questions on radar information.

Indonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country's search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the "ill-fated aircraft" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia's leader.

"Australia will do its duty in this matter," Abbott told parliament. "We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."

Australia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

##1085|With less than three weeks before a looming deadline for enrolling in mandatory health coverage, the federal government has unveiled several rule changes affecting Obamacare insurers and their customers.

The changes, revealed in a flurry of announcements in recent days, will broaden the size of provider networks in some health plans next year, give insurers financial relief, affirm that certain groups will receive health benefits that were being questioned and extends temporary coverage to some people with pre-existing conditions.

Amid those announcements, The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that officials are preparing to effectively grant an extension of the March 31 deadline for Obamacare enrollment to last-minute shoppers who run into technical problems on government exchanges, and who can document those problems.

Deadline extended?

Federal officials Monday said only, "Open enrollment ends March 31," when CNBC.com asked about the Journal report.

But if officials do end up extending the deadline, it would not be surprising. In December, when dealing with large numbers of people trying to sign up for health coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2014, the government several times effectively extended the enrollment deadline, and leaned on insurers to get them to honor sign-ups that occurred after the deadline.

Under the Affordable Care Act, nearly every American must have some form of health insurance by March 31 or face a tax penalty next year.

Network sizes

One major change announced by the government will effectively compel insurers selling plans on the Obamacare exchanges for 2015 to increase the minimum number of so-called essential community providers in the plans' networks. Such providers serve lower-income and other "medically under-served" populations, and include federally qualified health centers, children's hospitals, HIV and STD clinics, and family planning clinics.##1086|Based on a new Reuters survey of economists, The U.S. Federal Reserve is now believed to begin raising interest rates from their near-zero levels in the September ending quarter of calendar 2015, as the country’s jobless rate goes down and the economy heads towards an upwards trajectory.

According to the Reuters poll, more than half (32 out of 63) of the economists surveyed believed that the Fed would increase short-term rates in the June or September quarters of 2015, while 14 of 63 believed the rate increase could happen before the second half of next year. Only six economists forecasted a later rate increase than quarter three 2015. Only two out of the three number-crunchers gave a general prediction of 2015.

The Fed has kept short-term interest rates low, or at near-zero levels since December 2008, pursuant to stimulating the U.S. economy, and has maintained this so-called “ultra-easy” monetary policy since then, as the economy recovered from the doldrums of 2008.

Speaking in general, the economists surveyed said that the U.S. unemployment rates may go below 6 percent sometime next year, particularly in the second half, hence necessitating an increase in rates and a change in policy. “You are looking at an unemployment rate that probably gets below 6 percent by the second half of 2015 and that’s within a hair’s breath of full employment,” said Bank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson. “It will start to push up wage growth by that period.” Conversely, Moody’s Analytics senior economist Ryan Sweet posited that the Fed may “start to raise interest rates sooner than the markets expect.”

The Reuters survey generated a average forecast of 6.4 percent for the unemployment rate in 2014. This may be indicative of this key statistic crossing the 6.5 percent threshold that central bank policymakers have set as a trigger for potential interest rate increases from near-zero levels. For 2015, the economists believe that the jobless rate could reach 5.9 percent. The metric was at 6.6 percent in January 2014, but had ticked up slightly to 6.7 percent as of last month’s reading; with unemployment figures trending downwards, the Fed has since decided to start tapering, or cutting back on its asset purchases, and is now making these purchases to the tune of $65 billion per month. A similar $10 billion taper is expected to be confirmed at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which takes place from March 18 through 19.

In other key takeaways from the survey, the economists forecasted faster wage growth, what with drag in the employment market substantially less evident than it was before. Nonfarm payrolls may average about 200,000 new jobs created per month in the June ending quarter of 2014, following laggard job creation in the March quarter. Employment stats in the March frame, among other figures, are believed by experts to be skewered due to unusually harsh weather in the winter months.

Additionally, the economists opined that the increase in wages pertained to above may not result in an increase in inflation, as slower growth rates in emerging countries may serve as the proverbial albatross preventing commodity price growth. Another variable that may keep inflation from building up, according to the survey, is a stronger greenback in relation to world currencies.##1087|Empty##1088|Empty##
