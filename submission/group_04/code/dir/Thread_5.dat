Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

Application may not work as expected.###5028||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5030||Empty###5031||Empty###5032||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###5035||Empty###5036||Let’s bite back on Oracle earnings coverage before it has the chance to bite us. Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.80% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -1.23% to Workday WDAY, -1.86% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, +0.48% or even Apple AAPL, +1.61% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The retail giant's trade-in program will allow customer to bring in old videogames in exchange for store credit in all of its 3,100 branches or at Sam's Club. In Walmart's blog, Justin Williamson, director of entertainment wrote, "Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want."

However, with Walmart's new offering, they are in direct completion with GameStop, the biggest seller of used games in the United States, according to the NY Times. In fact, the company's used-game products accounts for more than 27 percent of their total sales, which is roughly around $2.4 billion.

At first, GameStop was feeling confident regarding Walmart's decision to enter the same industry, stating that it has emerged victorious against larger competitors, Dallas Sun reported. In a press statement, the game retailer said, "We have faced many competitions in the past who have tried to enter the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top. Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battled. We've beat out other large retailers when they've entered the category."

And now, it seems GameStop is already feeling the effects of Walmart's presence in the industry even though its trade-in program hasn't even started yet. But this isn't the first time the game retailer's stocks plummeted because of Walmart. In December of 2009, GameStop's shares dropped by almost 9 percent after Walmart slashed its videogame prices by 15 to 20 percent as part of its holiday deal, Kotaku reported.

Walmart's trade-in program will begin on March 26. Games designed for the Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation 4 can be traded for eGift cards which can be used to "purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online."

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

This will include building more than 500,000 base stations in 2014, to help bolster its high-speed 4G service launched in December.

China Mobile also plans to sell 100 million 4G devices such as smartphones and tablets this year, according to the presentation, which was released after the firm’s 2013 earnings results.

Revenues from SMS and MMS messaging shrank 6.5 percent in 2013 while voice sales shrank 3.4 percent, as these formerly lucrative sources of income have been replaced by services like Tencent Holdings’ WeChat, which are carried on a user’s mobile data plan.

###5050||Colorado started off 2014 with a declining unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, continuing a sustained downward trend evident in 2013.

The last time the unemployment rate was as low as 6.1 percent was December 2008.

In addition employers added 7,300 nonfarm payroll jobs from December to January for a total of 2,412,200 jobs.

The number of people actively participating in the labor force increased 5,900 to 2,754,600 and total employment increased 8,000 to 2,586,100 causing the number of unemployed to decline 2,000, according to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down one and one-tenth of a percentage point from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

The Colorado unemployment rate peaked at 9.1 percent in October 2010 and has declined almost without interruption since then, said officials.

In December, Colorado posted an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent.

The December figure was the lowest unemployment rate in five years.

By comparison, the unemployment rate in September was 6.9 percent; 6.8 percent in October, 6.5 percent in November, and 6.2 in December.

Adrian Wyllie went on the attack on Monday, insisting the lower unemployment rate means nothing.

Scotts) watch, and his lackluster policies have directly resulted in thousands of lost jobs in Florida, Wyllie insisted on Monday. Floridas labor participation rate has fallen from the 25-year average of 62.4 percent, down to 59.6 percent, according to the Florida Legislature Office of Economic and Demographic Research.

Its easy to tout positive unemployment numbers when you stop counting the 441,859 Floridians who have given up hope of finding work, Wyllie added.

The company, which was created nearly six years ago as a way to help people find spare rooms and couches to sleep on, is in advanced talks to raise more than $US400 million in capital, a round of financing that would value it at more than $US10 billion, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday. Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology start-up firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing start-ups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday. But Airbnb, a centrepiece of what has become known as “the sharing economy," is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords in big cities, as well. Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added.

The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are continuing and may still fall apart, these people cautioned. Advertisement

Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $US170 billion — paid more than $US16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $US8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged," said Colin C. Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out." Others view the valuation race more sceptically.

“We’re seeing valuations go nuts," said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr. Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.

Under the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations.###5056||Empty###5057||French satellite image shows possible debris

New French satellite images show possible debris from a missing Malaysian airliner deep in the southern Indian Ocean, Malaysia said March 23, adding to growing signs that the plane may have gone down in remote seas off Australia.The latest lead came as the international search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace of the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board.“This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor,” the Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement. “Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination center.”Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said there was “increasing hope” of a breakthrough in the hunt for the plane on the strength of Chinese and Australian satellite images of possible large debris in the southern search area.The French Foreign Ministry said radar echoes from a satellite put the new debris finding about 2,300 km from Perth, without giving a direction or a date.The debris in the Australian image was about 2,500 km southwest of Perth and the Chinese sighting, captured two days later, was around 120 km “south by west” of that.An international force resumed its search efforts March 23, zeroing in on two areas around where the sightings were made in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris, including a wooden pallet, spotted by a search plane on March 22.China said the object it had seen on the satellite image was 22 meters long and 13 meters wide, floating in some of the most inhospitable sea territory on Earth.It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same as those detected by Australia, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, said a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search.###5058||Empty###5059||Twitter has been largely shut down in Turkey, just hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “wipe out” the social network which, along with others, was highlighting corruption allegations against his inner circle.

The state-run Anatolia news agency said authorities “technically blocked access to Twitter” late Thursday because the service had ignored various Turkish court orders to remove some links deemed illegal.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content. “Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

Twitter, mwitter! We will wipe out all of these. This has nothing to do with freedoms

RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN

Twitter responded by saying on its official policy feed that Turks could get around the block by tweeting through mobile telephone text services.

In early reaction, the EU commissioner for digital agenda, Neelie Kroes, tweeted that the block in Turkey “is groundless, pointless, cowardly”. She added that the “Turkish people and international community will see this as censorship. It is.”

The restriction of access to Twitter came after Erdogan told a rally drumming up support for March 30 local elections that he would eradicate Twitter access in the country.

“We will wipe out Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says,” he said.

Erdogan’s office said in a statement that Twitter had remained “indifferent” to Turkish court rulings demanding “some links” be removed, and that the premier therefore had turned his attention to the matter.

The website for the country’s telecommunications authority (TIB) turned up four separate court rulings referencing “twitter.com”. One of them said: “The protection measure has been taken for this website (twitter.com) according to the decision ... of the Istanbul chief public prosecutor’s office and has been implemented by the TIB.”

Anatolia ran a report saying a Twitter block was the only solution to “address the unjust treatment of our citizens”.

Erdogan, Turkey’s charismatic and increasingly autocratic leader since 2003, has come under mounting pressure since audio recordings spread across social media that appeared to put him at the heart of a major corruption scandal.

Recordings include an apparent discussion between Erdogan and his son about hiding money, as well as and others in which he seems to be interfering in business deals, court cases and the media’s coverage.

Some of the most damaging information has come from a Twitter account, under the name Haramzadeler (“Sons of Thieves”), which appears to have access to a huge trove of secret documents and police wiretaps linked to the investigation.

Erdogan has dismissed most of the recordings as “vile” fakes concocted by his rivals, and threatened to ban YouTube and Facebook after crucial local elections on March 30. “Twitter, mwitter!,” Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.

“We will wipe out all of these. This has nothing to do with freedoms. Freedom does not mean the right to intrude on someone’s privacy, or to pass the state’s secrets to the international arena.”

The prime minister is openly suspicious of the internet and last year called Twitter a “menace” for helping organise mass anti-government protests.

A vast corruption inquiry launched in December saw dozens of people rounded up, including close business and political allies of the prime minister.

The Turkish strongman has accused associates of a former staunch ally – US-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States – of being behind the graft probe that claimed the scalps of four ministers. Gulen has denied any involvement in the matter.

Turkey recently tightened government control of the internet and the judiciary, generating criticism from rights groups.

The country, which has more than 10 million Twitter users, has seen access to thousands of sites blocked in recent years. YouTube was banned for two years up to 2010 because of material deemed insulting to the country’s revered founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

The Internet Publishers Association, a body representing online and media companies, said the move to block Twitter was an attempt to “destroy freedom of expression”.###5060||The safe-haven yen stayed below a recent peak against the dollar and the euro stood firm on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea's weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar held steady at 101.76 yen, staying above a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday. The dollar gained some support against the yen after US Treasury yields rose on Monday as safety demand for government debt receded.

The euro edged up 0.1 % to $1.3934, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit on Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

Against the yen, the euro edged up 0.1 % to about 141.79 yen.

After Sunday's referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and the European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

"In immediate focus is Russian president Putin's speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

"But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving US government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar," he said.

PUTIN SPEECH President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia's State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow's involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia's armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

One possible resistance level for the dollar against the yen now lies around 102.30 yen, said Philip Wee, senior currency economist for DBS Bank in Singapore.

The dollar's 20-day moving average now lies roughly around 102.30 yen, while the 100-day moving average comes in slightly above that level, around 102.38 yen.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8729.

The dollar had hit a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8698 against the Swiss franc last week on trading platform EBS, but has since pulled up from that trough as investor risk aversion ebbed.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against six major currencies, was at 79.355, clinging above a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the US consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar's likely direction.



First Published: Mar 18, 2014 08:27 IST###5061||Two California men seeking to auction a rare aluminum penny have been told by the federal government to stop, resulting in a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the United States Mint.

The story begins with Randall Lawrence, a real estate agent who possessed the penny for years without realizing its value until after he sold it along with other coins to Michael McConnell, owner of the La Jolla Coin Shop of San Diego, California.

McConnell informed Lawrence that the penny, made in 1974 at the Denver Mint, was part of a rare batch made of aluminum, instead of the traditional copper. The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.

The government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile’s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.

Mint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.

The aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.

Lawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father’s belongings after his death in 1980.

“When he died…that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,” recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. “I kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years… I had no idea what that penny was worth.”

McConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. “I wouldn’t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him," McConnell said.

“It’s a godsend,” Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “For someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.”

Regardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.

Because the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.

Lawrence rejects this notion.

“Thousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never ‘issued’ as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,” he says in the lawsuit. “These include coins that were actually sold or ‘gifted’ by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.”

Lawrence has called the government’s position “radical,” and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department’s claim to the penny.

Meanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.

It’s 12 days since the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A 250-ton Boeing 777-200 has, for the time being, vanished. Twenty-six countries have joined a search of 2.24m square nautical miles from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite images have given investigators cause to believe there may be debris in the southern Indian Ocean, but so far, a search of the area has found nothing.

In the absence of confirmed sightings, speculation has been rife about what happened to the plane and the 239 people on board, with competing theories feverishly discussed by professionals and amateurs. Some sound more plausible than others. Here, we assess the relative merits of the more prominent explanations for the plane’s disappearance.

1. What happened?

It was an accident …

Those remaining hopeful that no one deliberately wronged MH370 and its passengers were boosted by a much-shared online post by Christopher Goodfellow, a former pilot. Something malfunctioned, Goodfellow surmised, and a sharp turn to the left made in the flight’s first hour was, in fact, a swift attempted re-route by the pilot to the nearest runway on which he could land: a 13,000-foot strip on Pulau Langkawi, the largest island in an archipelago of 104 in the Andaman Sea.

The left turn is the key here. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a very experienced senior captain with 18,000 hours of flight time. We old pilots were drilled to know what is the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Airports behind us, airports abeam us, and airports ahead of us. They’re always in our head. Always. If something happens, you don’t want to be thinking about what are you going to do – you already know what you are going to do. When I saw that left turn with a direct heading, I instinctively knew he was heading for an airport. He was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi, a 13,000-foot airstrip with an approach over water and no obstacles.

Goodfellow theorised that “there was most likely a fire or electrical fire” He suggested that the plane’s transponder and ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) were shut off as casualties of a scramble to tackle this blaze. “In the case of fire the first response is to pull all the main [electrical] busses and restore circuits one by one until you have isolated the bad one,” he said, adding that the crew could have been incapacitated by smoke before they could land, leaving the plane to fly on for six or more hours on autopilot, before eventually crashing.

Goodfellow’s theory was comfortingly simple, but suffered from a major shortcoming. Malaysian authorities have said the plane appeared to have been re-routed a second time after that first sharp turn. A third tracking device, on the plane’s engines, continued sending intermittent electronic “pings” via satellite to the ground for another six hours, indicating that the plane continued to fly.

The final “ping” put its last known position on one of two arcs. Investigators said that the electronic “pings” put its last known position on one of two arcs of a circle emanating out from the satellite that detected it. One arc is to the north, over China, and the other is to the south over the Indian ocean, off the western coast of Australia. Goodfellow’s assumed autopilot could not have taken the plane to either destination.

“If the pings are accurate, the plane turned again,” said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and an author on aviation. “Autopilot only does what it tells you to.” He went on: “It is also very unlikely that the plane could have carried on flying for hours after it had indeed suffered a fire or other mechanical catastrophe”. Smith concluded: “It is not a strong theory.”

It was no accident …

After it was discovered that the two separate communications systems were turned off, investigators said that they had concluded that MH370 was the victim of a hijacking or sabotage. “These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,” Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said. Little other solid evidence has been produced or cited by the Malaysians for why this conclusion was reached. Still, two theories followed.

a) The pilot or co-pilot were responsible

Attention has focused on captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. A transponder and ACARS can only be shut down by someone who knows what he or she is doing. “The flight crew, by virtue of the controls and the circuit-breaker panels in the cockpit, have the ability to remove power from them,” said Dennis Schmitz, a veteran engineer and executive in the aviation communications industry. Malaysian ministers also initially said, at a 15 March news conference, that one of the communicating systems was switched off before the last known verbal message from the cockpit – “all right, good night”.

But authorities later backtracked on this, admitting they did not know exactly when the systems were shut down. The pilots did not show signs of radical activity, although Shah’s support for a Malaysian opposition leader jailed the day before the flight has been much analysed. The pair also did not request to fly together, and appear to have been upstanding professionals, according to several profiles. Adding to the confusion, US officials briefed reporters in recent days that the plane was first manually rerouted before that final verbal sign-off – again indicating foul play in the cockpit from someone with technical knowhow. “That is a red flag,” said Smith.



Shah kept a flight simulator at home. Malaysian officials said on Wednesday that some files had been removed from it several weeks ago. “The experts are looking at what are the logs, what has been cleared,” Malaysian police inspector general Tan Sri Khalid Bin Abu Bakar told reporters, at a news conference. Hishammuddin Hussein, the defence and acting transport minister, appeared to confirm reports that the FBI had been asked to help analyse the files, which he said were being looked at with “local and international expertise”.

b) The plane was hijacked by someone else

If the plane was deliberately sabotaged, and the pilots were not responsible, someone else on the plane must have been. Malaysian military radar “appeared to show that the missing airliner climbed to 45,000 feet” before descending steeply, the New York Times reported, which could potentially indicate a struggle in the cockpit. However, this report also prompted speculation that a knowledgeable flyer had deliberately flown that high in an attempt to deprive some on board of oxygen, thus knocking them out or even killing them.

There remains a lack of consensus among experts about the precise technicalities of ACARS. A full disabling of the system requires circuits to be broken not only in the cockpit “but also in the electronics bay”, according to Smith. This bay is found beneath the flight deck, indicating that someone involved was at one point outside the cockpit.

The passengers included two men flying on stolen passports and at least one from China’s restive Xinjiang region, whose separatist militants were blamed for a knife attack at a railway station that killed 29 people earlier this month.

Yet the men travelling on stolen passports appear to have been seeking asylum in Europe and had no clear connection to terrorism or militant groups. Background checks on passengers and crew have turned up no likely suspects, and China has announced that it has unearthed nothing untoward in the profiles of the two-thirds of passengers who were Chinese. Commandeering the plane, disabling its communications systems and flying it smoothly would require organisation and expertise that would seem difficult to hide.

However, no message claiming responsibility for taking the plane appears to have been left by any passenger, and no group has claimed responsibility for it. And – to state the obvious – nothing appears to have been done with it.

2. Where is the plane?

The northern of the two arcs identified by investigators as the possible locations from where the plane sent its final “ping” sweeps from southern to north-western China, prompting speculation that MH370 might have flown over south Asia towards smaller central territories, where it could have landed. Some have even suggested it could have been parked, awaiting use in a future terrorist attack. But “there are hundreds of planes in airports and depots all over the world,” Smith pointed out. “Why take this one and force the whole world to look for you?”

Kazakhstan and Krgyzstan were quickly singled out as potential landing spots. Yet both governments stressed that they would have detected the plane, and did not. “Even if all on-board equipment is switched off, it is impossible to fly through in a silent mode,” Serik Mukhtybayev, deputy head of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Committee, said in a statement. “There are also military bodies monitoring the country’s air space.” Dair Tokobayev, vice-president of Kyrgyzstan’s main civilian airport, told Reuters: “This plane did not fly over Kyrgyzstan’s territory.”

And for the plane to have reached that arc several hours after losing contact with the ground, it would have probably have needed to avoid detection by several major militaries in the region. While most countries protect the locations of their radar sites, researchers estimate that China alone has about 30 long-range systems.

“They must have long-range radar out there,” said Ron Ruggeri, a veteran air-traffic controller and instructor at Vaughn College of aeronautics and technology. “If the plane did go that way, somebody would have seen it.” He went on: “Things are also a little on-edge in that part of the world. If they did not know who this plane was, I’d expect them to scramble jets to find out”.

b) The plane flew somewhere else

Dismissing the significance of the two possible arcs, some have speculated that sightings show the MH370 went on to fly elsewhere. Residents of some remote islands in the Maldives said they had spotted a “low-flying jumbo jet” on the morning the MH370 disappeared, according to Haveeru, a local news site. Their description seemed to match that of the missing jet.

However the Maldives government swiftly dismissed the suggestion. “Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country,” said the Maldives National Defence Force in a statement, adding that airport radar had come up short, too.

Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox, suggested on Twitter that the plane might have been “effectively hidden, perhaps in northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden”. The Pakistani government has firmly rejected the notion and said the plane was not detected by its radars. Indian officials have also pushed back against speculation the plane flew over the country.

c) The plane flew to the south and probably crashed into the sea

Proponents of the second arc, which curves away gradually from the western coast of Australia, have MH370 heading south from its sharp left turn, over the Indian ocean. The lack of confirmed sightings by radar systems to the north, and the fact that no wreckage of the plane has been recovered in Asia, has boosted speculation that this is the more likely of the two directions. On Thursday, the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, told parliament in Canberra that satellite imagery had found two possible pieces of debris at a location 2,500km (1,500 miles) south-west of Perth. Detailed analysis of that imagery produced “new and credible information”, he said, although an initial aerial search turned up nothing.

Map shows where the Australian Maritime Safety Authority plans to search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on 18 March 2014.

After hitting the southern arc and flying on for a little longer, the plane could have descended into the two-mile-deep ocean and sunk, along with its two “black box” data recorders that will have collected information and audio from the cockpit. More than a third of the recorders’ 30-day batteries, which allow it to send a beacon-like signal to investigators, have now expired.



Experts stress that the south is likely to prove more fruitful. “I look for who would have the best intelligence,” said Dr Todd Curtis, a former airline safety analyst for Boeing. “The US has a view of what’s going on all over the world, and when the White House announced last week that it was despatching the seventh fleet to the Indian Ocean, it signalled to me that this was the most likely location. And since then, the Australians have taken the lead down there.”

Australia said on Thursday that it had halved the search area in the Indian Ocean – albeit to an area still covering 300,000 square kilometres – and moved it closer to Perth.

Reuters quoted a source close to the investigation on Wednesday as saying: “The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor.” Within hours, however, this had been challenged by the Malaysian defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein. “They are both equally important,” he said of the two arcs. “But the southern corridor is much more challenging.”###5063||New York

The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form a store credit.

The world's largest retailer began offering the feature, called "Savings Catcher," on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Citibank launched a similar program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if Citibank finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.###5064||By Eva Taylor and Kirsti Knolle

MANNHEIM, Germany, March 18 (Reuters) - German analyst and investor sentiment plunged in March at the fastest pace in nearly a year amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could weigh on Europe’s largest economy, a leading survey showed on Tuesday.

Mannheim-based think tank ZEW’s monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts. The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

It was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

“The Crimea Crisis is weighing on expert’s economic expectations for Germany,” said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. “Nevertheless, the indicator’s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The United States and European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.

The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0 yet still underscoring the strength of the German economy.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said the combination of emerging market turbulences earlier this year and the stand-off between Russia and the West may have a “mildly dampening impact on Germany’s investment climate” and therefore on growth.

But he noted that “it would take a much more serious crisis in Ukraine to derail the recovery in Germany and the euro zone as a whole”.

The German economy, a growth locomotive in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8 percent this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.

Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January. Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.

The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said.###5065||Janet Yellen answers a question at a news conference following the March 2014 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, while at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington.

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it could keep interest rates unusually low even after the US job market returns to full strength and inflation rises to the central bank's target.

In announcing its view on future rates after a two-day policy meeting, it also dropped a set of guideposts it was using to help the public anticipate when it would finally start bumping overnight borrowing costs up from zero.

It said, however, that dropping a promise to hold rates steady "well past the time" the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent did not indicate any change in its policy intentions. Rather than relying on unemployment and inflation thresholds to guide expectations, it said would lean on a wide range of economic indicators in making its decision.

But what stood out in the central bank's statement was its embrace of easy money policies even after the Fed achieves its goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation.

"Economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run," the Fed's policy panel said after its first meeting chaired by Janet Yellen.

Yellen, who took the helm of the central bank on Feb. 1, is set to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).

U.S. stock prices fell after the statement was released, while yields on U.S. government debt rose.

The central bank also proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota dissented, saying that dropping the threshold could hurt the credibility of the Fed's commitment to return inflation to 2 percent.

MEASURE WIND DOWN

The decision to continue to scale back its stimulus keeps the Fed on track for the measured wind down laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke. The Fed repeated that it plans to continue trimming the asset purchases in "measured steps" as long as labor conditions continue to improve and inflation shows signs of rising back toward the Fed's 2-percent goal.

The Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.

The Fed had said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.

But the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs.

Of the Fed's 16 policymakers, only one believes it will be appropriate to raise rates this year; 13 expect a first rate hike next year, and 2 others see the first rate hike coming in 2016, according to fresh forecasts published on Wednesday. But once rate hikes start, Fed officials see slightly sharper increases than they did in December, with rates ending 2015 at 1 percent and ending 2016 at 2.25 percent, according to the median of forecasts.

In December, Fed officials expected short-term rates to be just 1.75 percent by the end of 2016.

The new forecasts also show Fed officials see unemployment dropping slightly faster, to between 5.6 percent and 5.9 percent by the end of 2015. In December their forecasts called for unemployment falling to between 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015.

KEEPING MARKETS IN LINE

The Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring.

It began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10 billion.

At the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But as the actual jobless rate neared the threshold, officials began to seek a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy.

They want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts. If traders start to price in earlier rate hikes, the result would be tighter financial conditions that could deter the very investment and hiring that the Fed wants to promote.

Many Fed officials, including Yellen, have said recent weakness in economic data, from jobs and retail sales to industrial production and home building, appears largely due to the unusually harsh winter and should soon dissipate.

US Fed revamps rates guidance, trims bond buys further

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy's strength, and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.

KEY POINTS:

* Fed dropping its promise to hold rates steady "well past the time" the U.S. unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent doesn't indicate any change in the Fed's policy intentions.

* Fed cuts monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

* Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.

COMMENTS: MARGARET KERINS, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME STRATEGY, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, CHICAGO:

"Her speech was extremely dovish, but we believed going in to the Fed meeting today the market was priced to the perfect dove. There was a slight change in the summary of economic projections, the jobs were slightly more hawkish and the rapid improvement in the labor market was reflected in those projections by the Fed themselves, even though they're adding in quite a grouping of labor market indicators that they're watching.

"They're going to have to focus on that lack of growth potential going forward, and introducing that today. But clearly the market is reading it as hawkish. We don't think that the Fed given where we are in the economic cycle and in terms of the recovery, and our expectation that the economy will take off following this somewhat weather-related downturn that it's very, very hard to be credible about keeping rates really, really low."

BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:

"I think the (stock) market initially reacted negatively to the Fed's statement because the forward guidance is mildly hawkish. Yellen is no dove. She's a pragmatist. The new forward guidance axes the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and replaces it with inflation expectations. The interesting twist here is that the Fed is fine with a zero federal funds rate provided the Fed projects inflation to still be below its target of 2 percent. It used to be that the Fed would tolerate projected inflation running a half percent hotter than that. Also, it's not just about the Fed's projections, but the public's expectations of inflation. The Fed wants to keep inflation expectations anchored and those expectations can be fickle."

SCOTT CLEMONS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN PRIVATE BANKING, NEW YORK:

"It strikes me as a pretty dovish statement, but what surprised me is the word choice. Right now the unemployment rate remains elevated. I think that the Fed is far more focused on that than they are on their other mandate, inflation."

"The bigger picture here, to me this sends a very strong signal that the Yellen Fed is a continuation of the Bernanke Fed in one very important aspect. Whereas the Fed is often thought of as having two policy tools, balance sheet operations and interest rates, under Bernanke and Yellen they have made communication a very potent third tool as well. They're going to communicate, communicate, communicate so that when the fed funds rate begins to move higher, hopefully the collective economy shrugs its shoulders and says, 'Yeah, we knew that was coming.'"

JIM KOCHAN, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:

"The committee has updated its forward guidance, I wish they would tell us what that updated forward guidance is. We can assume their forward guidance is that they will be looking at broader measures of labor market activity to see when it's appropriate to raise interest rates, and 6.5 percent doesn't have much meaning anymore. If there are going to be any surprises it's going to be with the press conference. I think it was very much as expected."

DAVID MOLAR, PARTNER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR AT HIGHTOWER, SAN DIEGO:

"The Fed moved the goal post again. It goes from a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold to a qualitative approach which is nebulous for the market. No one knows what will trigger further tapering, a pause in tapering or an increase in asset purchase. It's a major change in policy. This Fed seems to be making it up as it goes along. The markets are spiking on this even though analysts have been expecting this along. Gold has sold off and you are seeing pressure on bonds and rate-sensitive sectors."

MARK GRANT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SOUTHWEST SECURITIES, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA: "What seems to be troubling the market is that even though it reiterated that it wouldn't be raising rates this year, people were put on notice that a hike is coming. We'll likely see some rise in short rates as a result of this, if not out across the whole curve." SHAUN OSBORNE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: "It's a little bit more hawkish than people expected. They seem to see interest rates rising sooner rather than later. People had been expecting something slightly more dovish given the effects on economic activity from the harsh winter. This is helping the dollar." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO, LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "I think everybody expected a $10 billion cut in the rate of QE3 purchases to $55 billion, so there's no surprise there. "There was a high degree of speculation in terms of changing the Fed language, so there was some clarity on that point. "Probably the biggest takeaway was the Fed saying they would possibly consider maintaining monetary policy or interest rates lower than what they would normally be even when the Fed guideline targets of unemployment and inflation were hit. So the question becomes whether that would in fact create some inflation pressure." THOMAS DI GALOMA, CO-HEAD FIXED INCOME RATES, ED&F MAN CAPITAL, NEW YORK "This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets -- the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015."

WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, ROCKWELL SECURITIES, NEW YORK "So far this is just what the market wanted-the Fed staying accommodative. It doesn't look like too much has changed, although dropping the 6.5 percent unemployment rate might be a key issue. Yields are jumping up right now, which might be a sign that people think Yellen will tighten sooner rather than later, or that inflation could come into the market if the Fed keeps rates low well past 6.5 percent."

BRUCE McCAIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, KEY PRIVATE BANK, CLEVELAND, OHIO "At this point, there are relatively few surprises. I think in some sense, as the Fed tapers it becomes less important for the market. What becomes more important from here is whether the economy can recover its momentum once the weather issue thaws. One of the headlines I saw was that a majority of members do expect a rate hike. I think that's a little disappointing for investors. In addition, if we replace the 6.5 percent rate with a variety of indicators, that makes Fed actions less predictable, which adds to the market uncertainty." PAUL MANGUS, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH AND STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO PRIVATE BANK, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA "The one difference I could see early on was a little bit more information on when and by how much the Fed may increase rates in 2015, which is a long way off yet. Other than that, we expected to hear more about a wider range of economic indicators beyond the unemployment rate and that was in the release, so that was not a surprise. The economic information that was supplied was also pretty much as expected, mentions of weaker labor markets earlier in the year due to weather conditions but showing signs of improving. Other areas of the economy are continuing to show signs of gradual improvement, but the Fed was looking for a much stronger economic background before it would start any type of tightening efforts, so it would continue to support liquidity in the marketplace."

Buying used Car###5066||Empty###5067||Anti-virus software maker Symantec (SYMC) late Thursday fired CEO and President Steve Bennett, who had cut costs and was amid a major restructuring during his short tenure at the top.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.

Symantec stock was down 6.5% in after-hours trading, after the announcement. Symantec stock rose 1.6% in the regular session stock market today, closing at 20.91. The stock is down more than 25% since early August.

Director Michael Brown was appointed interim CEO while the company searches for a new leader. Brown joined Symantec's board in July 2005 and formerly served as CEO at Quantum.

Bennett joined Symantec as a board member in February 2010 and became chairman in August 2011. Bennett was named CEO and president in July 2012.

In January, when the company reported a third consecutive quarter of EPS growth acceleration, Bennett told analysts on a conference call that costs had come down because of "lower spending and increased organizational efficiency."

But sales fell 5% in fiscal Q3 ended Dec. 27, the second consecutive quarterly decline.

The company in January 2013 split the roles of CEO and chairman, electing board member Schulman to the latter position.

"Separating the positions of chairman and CEO allows me to focus on executing the company's strategic plan and managing the company's operations and performance," Bennett said in a statement at the time.

In an early February Q&A with IBD, Bennett was asked how things were going after most salespeople had been given new territory assignments.

"When you make that kind of big change, it creates some challenges, and we're still working through those," Bennett said then. "We'll be anxious to see how much progress we make in the fourth quarter. The pipeline looks solid."

Symantec is slated to report results for its fiscal Q4 ended on or near March 31 on May 7.

In answer to another question in the Q&A, Bennett was candid about the company's challenges, saying, "We're making the hard decision to position the company to win in the long term and taking a little short-term pain to reposition the company."

British financial markets largely followed that pattern although sterling recovered some recent losses before a raft of potentially market-moving news including the government’s annual budget, Bank of England minutes and unemployment data.

Europe’s major stock markets were down as much as a third of one percent in early trading, following Asian shares lower after the the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.2 percent.

Underlying worries over China’s financial and property sectors bubbled to the surface, pushing Chinese stocks lower and the yuan to its weakest level in a year through 6.20 per dollar.

This is the first time the yuan has traded more than 1 percent beyond the midpoint set by the central bank after the daily trading band was widened to 2 percent.

Global investors’ main focus, however, remain the Fed and Russia.

“I expect gradually the focus to shift away from the tensions between Russia and the West, unless we see actual violence or some type of events other than sanctions that would be seen as an escalation,” Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea in Helsinki, said.

Earlier, pro-Russian units took control of part of a naval base in Ukraine, in the clearest sign so far that Russian soldiers and volunteers who support them had begun to take control of Ukrainian military facilities across the Black Sea peninsula.

Ukraine’s acting defence minister Ihor Tenyukh said shortly after that his country’s forces would not withdraw from Crimea even though Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty to make it part of Russia.

Later on Wednesday in Washington, the Fed is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus by $10 billion a month for a third time in a row and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.

The moves would represent both continuity at the U.S. central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to indications that recent economic weakness is not solely down to harsh winter weather.

By 0900 GMT Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.25 percent at 6,589 points, Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 percent at 9,250 points and France’s CAC 40 was down 0.2 percent at 4,304 points.

The FTSE Eurofirst index of the leading 300 European stocks was flat around 1,305 points.

In currencies, the euro was down slightly at $1.3920, retreating further from last week’s 2-1/2-year high of $1.3967 and was down further against sterling at 83.71 pence.

“Our analysis suggests that sterling is oversold against the euro,” Valentin Marinov, G10 currency strategist at Citi in London, said. “Sterling maybe in for a rebound ahead of the UK labour market data and BoE minutes and the March budget today.”

British finance minister George Osborne will announce a pre-election budget on Wednesday that is likely to offer some tax relief to voters but will stick closely to his tough decade-long plan to fix the public finances.

The British jobs market is expected to show further signs of improvement in February, and investors will scrutinise the latest Bank of England minutes for clues on when rates might be raised.

The dollar was up about 0.2 percent on the day at 101.65 yen. The yen showed little reaction to Japan’s larger-than-expected trade deficit.

In metals, spot gold was down 0.7 percent at $1,346 an ounce, slipping further back from a six-month high of $1,391.76 hit on Monday.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade in their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores.

Starting next week, customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers for in return for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games. The latter was an apparent reference to GameStop’s program.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think the move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

And Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pointed out that GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###5076||CLOSE Walmart announced it would begin taking trade-ins on used video games for store credit, and the move immediately sent the shares of GameStop down in early trading.

Wal-Mart's got game.

The world's largest retailer on Tuesday announced plans to seriously expand its video game trade-in program to its stores. Customer who bring in used video games can receive store credit -- but not cash -- at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores beginning March 26.

Until now, Wal-Mart offered trade-ins on a much more limited basis online.

For Wal-Mart, like most major retailers, it's about about driving more customers into the store and boosting revenue. Retailers like Wal-Mart and McDonald's that more widely appeal to lower-income customers have faced a tough time battling back from the economic downturn. These customers face bleaker employment prospects and many don't have extra money to spend.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.

Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Wal-Mart.com. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," added Mac Naughton.

This story cannot be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without prior authorization from the TH.###5078||Hospitality startup Airbnb has seen more than 11 million guests stay on the platform since being launched in 2007, which has led to some enthusiasm among investors. The company has already raised more than $300 million in funding, but the WSJ reports Airbnb is in “advanced talks” to raise an additional $400 million to $500 million.

With that report as a backdrop, Airbnb has shared some stats this morning that show its guests increasingly are traveling to, from, or in-between nations in Europe. In a blog post today, the company said that 50 percent of its guests over the last year were from Europe, and that number is only expected to grow over time.

Airbnb said that more than a million guests each from the U.K. and France have booked stays through its platform. Meanwhile, more than a million guests have stayed at places listed on Airbnb in both Italy and Spain. It’s likely that those guests and stays overlapped quite a bit — according to the company, more than 80 percent of European guests staying with Airbnb traveled to other destinations within Europe.

The growth comes as Airbnb has been investing in the continent over recent years — in 2012, the company opened offices in London, Paris, Barcelona, and Milan, among other European cities.

Airbnb has had a particularly international audience for a while, with three-quarters of all stays involving a stay by an international guest or a guest staying in an international listing. But this announcement marks a serious shift in the makeup of Airbnb guests. Back in 2011, about half of all guests were from the U.S., but that’s dropped to below 30 percent.

That said, the company expects its growth in Europe to accelerate even further. It forecasts that the number of European guests staying in unique listings will more than double in 2014.

That’s great news for a company that had already shown impressive growth in 2013 — seeing its overall stays jump from a total of 4 million at the beginning of the year to 11 million by the end of it.

Airbnb’s valuation is also seeing a big increase, according to the WSJ. Its last funding round of $200 million led by Founders Fund valued it at $2.5 billion, while the latest raise, which is expected to include private-equity firm TPG, values the company at around $10 billion.

For what it’s worth, Airbnb declined to comment on the report of new funding.###5079||Empty###5080||Empty###5081||Text size

GameStop shares are being zapped on worries about Wal-Mart's entry into the used-videogame market.

Early Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores (ticker: WMT) announced that on March 26 it would begin accepting used videogames from customers, who could then use the value of their trade-in for any purchases at the chain or at its Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart will in turn refurbish the games and sell them in "like-new condition."

MONTPELIER (AP) - The Vermont Department of Labor says the state's unemployment rate for January was 4 percent, a drop of two-tenths of one percent from December.

The Vermont rate, the fourth consecutive reported monthly decrease for the state, compares to a national unemployment rate of 6.6 percent for January.

Unemployment in Vermont's 17 labor markets ranged from a low of 2.5 percent in Warren-Waitsfield to a high of 7 percent in the Newport area.

Employment sectors that had significant job growth last month include state government, which added about 1,400 jobs, and professional and business services, 700 jobs.

The most significant declines came from construction, which dropped 800 jobs.###5083||Empty###5084||Empty###5085||MUNICH--German luxury car maker BMW AG gave a bullish outlook for profit and sales this year, but warned that its forecasts depend on political and economic stability.

Norbert Reithofer, chief executive officer of the Munich-based BMW automotive group, on Wednesday reaffirmed the company's target to sell more than two million cars for the first time this year. Boosted by higher car sales, Bayerische Motoren Werke's pretax earnings should show "clear growth" in 2014, he said.

Mr. Reithofer's upbeat outlook contained a considerable caveat in light of the continuing political uncertainty in Europe over Russia's planned annexation of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine and Europe's still weak economic recovery. Car sales in the European Union have risen nearly 7% so far this year, but industry executives remain cautious in their outlook for the full year.

"Just like you, we are monitoring the political and economic developments in the world," Mr. Reithofer said in a prepared speech. "Everything is fragile. Things could change at any moment."

As previously reported, BMW sold 1.96 million cars world-wide last year, an increase of 6.4%, and achieved sales of EUR76 billion, down 1% from a year earlier. BMW's net profit rose 4.5% to EUR5.34 billion last year, a record high for the automotive group.

Much of BMW's growth is coming from China and the U.S.

In 2013, BMW built 300,000 cars in its Spartenburg, South Carolina plant. With demand increasing, Mr. Reithofer reiterated that BMW is considering expanding capacity at the plant. No decision has been made.

In China, BMW expanded capacity to 300,000 cars a year last year and is already making preparations to expand further to 400,000. The German car group will also build a new engine plant with its joint venture partner Brilliance. The plant is expected to open in 2016.

We expect 2014 to be eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s comeback year as core business stabilizes, new initiatives scale and the company becomes more focused on returning cash to shareholders.

eBay and Icahn

We expect activist investor Icahn to propose his detailed reasoning for the spin-off of PayPal shortly. We believe Mr. Icahn will present his argument ahead of the shareholder meeting scheduled for early May.

We expect the following points to be made (with our quick thoughts):

1. PayPal will likely benefit from the power of focus. We believe PayPal is already the focus of all of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and most of its investments.

Rick Scott’s frequent raids to lure businesses from other states and even countries are paying off. He announced Monday that over a half-million jobs have been created in the last three years, as the unemployment continues to drop.

Scott said in Monday’s press release that Florida’s unemployment rate for January, 2014 was the state’s lowest since June, 2008 — 6.1 percent, 0.5 percent below the official national rate. Statewide unemployment has held below the national rate since August, 2013, and since December, 2010, Florida has created 503,500 private sector jobs.

“With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we’re making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida,” Scott said in a press release. “We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let’s keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one.”

Every March, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. The benchmark revisions represent an annual change in the level of employment or re-anchoring of survey estimates to actual employment counts from Reemployment Assistance tax records. This process also introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates. The benchmarked 2013 jobs data showed that the state created more private sector jobs than were originally estimated. Nearly 200,000 new private sector jobs were added in 2013 alone.

“With a five point drop in the statewide unemployment rate and more than 500,000 new private sector jobs created since December 2010, we have another successful chapter in Florida’s economic turnaround story” Jesse Panuccio, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity said. “More Florida families are getting back to work across the state, and there is still more work to do to foster an opportunity economy for Florida’s present and future generations.”

GameStop's unique selling point has always been the fact that it is the one big chain where you can go and trade in games, so does this mean that we're watching the end of an era? Probably not.

As it turns out, a handful of big chains have already tried to get in on the used-game market. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been accepting games for years now, and they've taken very little from GameStop. Analysts have said that they "do not believe Wal-Mart will have a material impact on GameStop's dominant used video game market share" and that "[history] suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share." In classic market style, GameStop's stock fell 5% on the news.

Why GameStop can hold it down

There are two main reasons that GameStop has been able to defend its moat. First, the company is, ostensibly, staffed with video game fans. When video gamers are looking for someone to talk to, they head to GameStop, where the in-depth discussion never ends. Just kidding: No one talks to employees anymore. What do you think this is, 1950?

The real reason GameStop can hold off Best Buy is that it generally has a bigger selection of games, and the value you get for trading in doesn't fluctuate enough between the two to drive business to Best Buy. If you're going to get the same amount for your game but you've got a broader selection of things to buy at GameStop, you're probably going to go there.

Wal-Mart is likely going to face the same headwinds as Amazon has. Amazon -- a company that competes on price for everything else -- has done, at best, a mediocre job of paying players for used games. Wal-Mart's plan is to take used games for store credit, without selling used games until they build up a collection. So for the first few months, you can walk in, leave your game, get some Wal-Mart credit -- the company won't give cash for games -- and then come back in a few months to buy a different used game.

GameStop isn't out of the woods

Just because Wal-Mart isn't going to crush GameStop doesn't mean that GameStop is fine. The company is still grappling with the increase in digital sales and the fact that the future is going to be all digital. While that time is still a ways off, GameStop needs to have a plan in place ahead of time. The good news is, if you believe that GameStop will get its act together -- I'm still on the fence -- today's fall would offer you a nice discount to get into GameStop. On the other hand, if you think it's all on its way to pear-shaped, maybe now is the time to cash out on those old Sonic games.###5090||Nearly all of the largest U.S. banks passed the Federal Reserve’s stress test, meaning they are prepared to withstand a severe recession or global downturn. Of the biggest 30 banks, only Zions Bancorp failed to meet the capital minimum required to survive a crisis.

“The largest banking institutions in the United States are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement.

While it’s safe to say that banks are safer, they’re far from reformed says Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the IMF and a professor of entrepreneurship at MIT.

Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Aaron Task sat down with Johnson at The Atlantic Economy Summit earlier this week (before the stress test results were announced) to discuss the state of U.S. banks.

“We need to keep moving the ball on this issue,” Johnson tells Task. “U.S. banks are supposed to produce a living will that shows how they should be broken up. I think there are many [government] officials who are questioning whether this exercise is being taken seriously by the banks and whether the banks are capable of demonstrating that they could fail without any government involvement.”

It appears that the big banks have moved away with from 2008 crisis and subsequent LIBOR controversies relatively scot-free. No executives were jailed, bank stocks and profits are nearing all-time highs and compensation for bank CEOs are approaching 2007 levels.

Related: Americans hate big banks, but can’t quit them

“There was an idea in 2005-2006 that banks had moved to some sort of new level in terms of technology and a philosophical understanding of the risks of finance and nobody says that anymore,” says Johnson. “Now they’re regarded as being very big political players, bullies in their markets, and people who behave inappropriately when given the opportunity. So that’s how they’re seen today which is quite different.”

But does that lead to improved policy and tighter constraints? “That remains to be seen,” says Johnson.

That's according to the numbers released today by state economists. The state's unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work. Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

“With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we’re making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," the governor said in a prepared statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let’s keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one.”

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

Florida has added close to 200,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest amount in the nation according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But it was not such good news for the Tampa Bay area. The region lost 14,100 jobs and its unemployment rate rocketed back up to 6.5 percent from an adjusted 6 percent in December.###5092||Japanese car maker Toyota is expected to reach a billion-dollar settlement with the US justice department to stop a criminal probe into the company's disclosure of safety issues, most notably dangerous unintended acceleration of some cars.

The company is set to pay more than $1bn (£602m, €718m) to the department in order to cap its four-year investigation, according to media reports. The fine is one of the largest ever imposed on an auto maker.

The settlement is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement, allowing Toyota to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. The settlement is not final and could still fall apart, according to WSJ.

A spokeswoman for Toyota told the newspaper that the company has been addressing many issues raised in the investigation.

"Toyota has cooperated with the US attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said.

"During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organisation, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Unintended Acceleration

Toyota had to recall millions of vehicles due to unintended acceleration in the late 2000s. The problem resulted in the death of a number of people in the US.

While the company recalled the problematic vehicles promptly, the US Justice Department found Toyota had made misleading statements about safety problems to the government and to the public. The investigation was led by the office of Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara.

The auto maker has been fined four times for a total of $66.2m by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for failing to report safety defects to the government. Three of those fines were related to issues concerning unwanted acceleration.

Toyota has never admitted wrongdoing in any of the law suits brought against it involving unintended acceleration.

The agreement with Toyota comes as the justice department is looking into a safety issue at General Motors.

GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. There were allegations that GM engineers knew about the issue years ago but the automaker was reluctant to recall vehicles until last month.###5093||You are using an older browser version.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously, they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It also will offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure because of a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.###5096||In the latest funding round for the popular do-it-yourself property rental market, Airbnb has reportedly been valued at US$10bn as it closes a US$500m funding round – a valuation that would make unicorns'(companies valued at more than US$1bn) eyes water.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.

NEW YORK | The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.



Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.



The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.



Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.



The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.



Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.'s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for "technological answers to saving them money and time."



Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.



The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's "every day low price" model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.



As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.



Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.



Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.



Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.



The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.



The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.



Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.



Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.



As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.



"They're doing the work for me," said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. "The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away."###5098||Nintendo shows off some of the modes and games available in Super Mario PartyWatch more trailers here!...###5099||Empty###5100||Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing the credit cards of customers using Russian banks affected by the economic sanctions announced in Washington, the banks said today.

Bank Rossiya, used by close associates of President Vladimir Putin, said in a statement that Visa and MasterCard had "without warning stopped providing its payment services to the bank's clients."

An affiliate bank, Sobinbank, which is 100%-controlled by Bank Rossiya, was also affected.

Bank Rossiya was hit by a fresh wave of Washington sanctions announced yesterday, which also targeted several billionaire businessmen believed to be close to Putin.

Clients of the banks are now unable to use their credit cards to make purchases or to withdraw money from cash machines not belonging to the banks.

SMP Bank, which is controlled by brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg who were among those blacklisted, also said its clients were unable to make Visa and MasterCard payments.

How business may ultimately shape the Ukraine crisis

US President Barack Obama yesterday said the list of Russians targeted by sanctions had been extended to include oligarchs and bankers believed to be close to Putin, including Gennady Timchenko and Yuri Kovalchuk.

Bank Rossiya was listed separately as a target for sanctions.

Americans and American businesses, such as Visa and MasterCard, are forbidden from any dealings with anyone targetted by the sanctions and any assets they might have in the US are frozen.

Putin responded today by vowing to open an account at Bank Rossiya on Monday.

SMP Bank said in a statement that it believed the move was "unlawful" because the sanctions targeted not the bank but its shareholders.

None of the banks affected have a major high-street presence, but Bank Rossiya is used by companies within Gazprom energy giant to pay salaries to staff, the Interfax news agency reported.

Russia's central bank said in a statement about Bank Rossiya that "the operations that come under sanctions are not having a significant impact on the financial stability of the credit organisation".

"If necessary suitable measures will be taken to support the credit organisation and give reliable protection of the interests of its account holders and creditors," Russia's central bank added.###5101||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec fired chief executive Steve Bennett on Thursday US time, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell as much as 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company said the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Symantec is facing stiff competition from nimbler network security software makers such as Palo Alto Networks and Checkpoint Systems.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you just add this to the list," Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for the fourth quarter.

Shares of GameStop plunged 5% in morning trading on Tuesday after Wal-Mart announced it was entering a prime space for the video game chain: used games.

Wal-Mart unveiled its new used games service, which will allow consumers to trade in older video games and apply it to any item purchased at Wal-Mart or Sam's Club. The program kicks off March 26.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart, in a blog post.

The used games industry has been dominated by GameStop, which makes a healthy chunk of its revenue off trade-ins. Wal-Mart isn't the only retailer to wade into the used games market. Both Amazon and Best Buy host similar services.

Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia estimates 43% of Gamestop's gross profit dollars come from their used games business.

Meanwhile, Microsoft stock is up 4.2% following reports the company plans on making its Office software available for Apple's iPad.

According to The Verge, Microsoft plans to host an event next week where it will unveil a version of its suite of Office apps for the Apple tablet. The report says the interface and features will be similar to the Office app for iPhone.

Investing.com - The dollar pulled away from session lows against the yen on Tuesday as investor sentiment improved following a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but mixed U.S. data on housing and inflation continued to weigh.

was last down 0.18% to 101.57, having reached intra-day highs of 101.77 as President Putin spoke. The pair fell to lows of 101.32 earlier in the session.

The pair was likely to find support at 101.19, last Friday’s low and a five-week low and resistance at 101.93, the session high.

Market sentiment recovered after President Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The speech came one day after the Russian president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

But the dollar remained under pressure after data showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But, U.S. housing starts fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Elsewhere, the euro remained slightly lower against the dollar, with slipping 0.13% to 1.3903.

The euro slid earlier after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

The report indicated that the economic upswing in Germany is not at risk. The assessment of current economic conditions improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February.###5110||Walmart is taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.

British financial markets largely followed that pattern although sterling recovered some recent losses before a raft of potentially market-moving news including the government’s annual budget, Bank of England minutes and unemployment data.

Europe’s major stock markets were down as much as a third of one percent in early trading, following Asian shares lower after the the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.2 percent.

Underlying worries over China’s financial and property sectors bubbled to the surface, pushing Chinese stocks lower and the yuan to its weakest level in a year through 6.20 per dollar.

This is the first time the yuan has traded more than 1 percent beyond the midpoint set by the central bank after the daily trading band was widened to 2 percent.

Global investors’ main focus, however, remain the Fed and Russia.

“I expect gradually the focus to shift away from the tensions between Russia and the West, unless we see actual violence or some type of events other than sanctions that would be seen as an escalation,” Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea in Helsinki, said.

Earlier, pro-Russian units took control of part of a naval base in Ukraine, in the clearest sign so far that Russian soldiers and volunteers who support them had begun to take control of Ukrainian military facilities across the Black Sea peninsula.

Ukraine’s acting defence minister Ihor Tenyukh said shortly after that his country’s forces would not withdraw from Crimea even though Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty to make it part of Russia.

Later on Wednesday in Washington, the Fed is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus by $10 billion a month for a third time in a row and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.

The moves would represent both continuity at the U.S. central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to indications that recent economic weakness is not solely down to harsh winter weather.

By 0900 GMT Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.25 percent at 6,589 points, Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 percent at 9,250 points and France’s CAC 40 was down 0.2 percent at 4,304 points.

The FTSE Eurofirst index of the leading 300 European stocks was flat around 1,305 points.

In currencies, the euro was down slightly at $1.3920, retreating further from last week’s 2-1/2-year high of $1.3967 and was down further against sterling at 83.71 pence.

“Our analysis suggests that sterling is oversold against the euro,” Valentin Marinov, G10 currency strategist at Citi in London, said. “Sterling maybe in for a rebound ahead of the UK labour market data and BoE minutes and the March budget today.”

British finance minister George Osborne will announce a pre-election budget on Wednesday that is likely to offer some tax relief to voters but will stick closely to his tough decade-long plan to fix the public finances.

The British jobs market is expected to show further signs of improvement in February, and investors will scrutinise the latest Bank of England minutes for clues on when rates might be raised.

The dollar was up about 0.2 percent on the day at 101.65 yen. The yen showed little reaction to Japan’s larger-than-expected trade deficit.

In metals, spot gold was down 0.7 percent at $1,346 an ounce, slipping further back from a six-month high of $1,391.76 hit on Monday.

John Hickenlooper (D) Monday, closes a loophole in the state's marijuana laws, extending the same packaging requirements to medical marijuana products that already exist for recreational ones.

Under the new law, edible marijuana products sold to medical marijuana patients must be in opaque, child-proof packaging. The law also allows marijuana businesses to confiscate fake IDs from minors, just as liquor stores do, and requires that marijuana grown in a home with minors must be enclosed and locked.

Advocates of the law, which included the marijuana industry, say it is an important clarification that will help keep legal marijuana from getting into the hands of minors. "Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Governor Hickenlooper, before signing the bill.

But there is still disagreement about whether the regulations go far enough. In particular, the popular niche of marijuana "edibles" – candy, cookies, gummy bears, lollipops – has been controversial, since skeptics say it can be too easy for someone to confuse the products with their non-pot-infused counterparts, or to ingest higher quantities of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, than they intend. There have also been concerns about the accuracy of testing and labeling, particularly when it comes to the potency of such products.

The new packaging requirements "are a step in the right direction," says Rachel O'Bryan, an attorney and member of Smart Colorado, a group pushing for tighter regulation. "But the underlying product in the packaging can still be confused with real food. The second you take it out of that packaging, you don't know if the product is a gummy bear or a" marijuana-infused product.

Ms. O'Bryan cites the incident in a Westminster, Colo., middle school last week in which a student brought marijuana candies to school and shared them with friends, some of whom said they didn't know the candy contained marijuana. In another incident, reported in Steamboat Springs last week, an 18-year-old man cleaning a condo apparently ate a candy bar left behind by the renters without realizing it was infused with marijuana. He went to the hospital and was treated for an overdose.

In the middle school incident, at least 15 students were involved, according to police and three have been arrested. Several more are facing suspensions. But O'Bryan says that she would prefer to see punishment of the adults – who presumably purchased the candy and made it accessible – than the students.

"We would like to see both messaging to Colorado parents, as well as strict enforcement of laws that when an adult gives marijuana to a child they are going to be held accountable," she says.

Her group would also like to see tighter regulations on the amount of marijuana concentrates that can be sold. Buying an ounce of pure THC, as is currently allowed, says O'Bryan, can be the equivalent of roughly 2,800 servings and yet could fit into a shampoo bottle. "That's concerning to us when the No. 1 [federal] priority is keeping it out of hands of minors."

Such concerns have some validity, says Michael Elliott, executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, but in most cases he doesn't think new laws are necessary. The packaging law was an appropriate way to close a loophole, Mr. Elliott says, but the Department of Revenue can look into limits on concentrates and can set rules.

"We have a very good process in place, and the Department of Revenue is doing a tremendous job in a very difficult environment," says Elliott.

Concerns have been raised, too, about the accuracy of testing and the ability of labs to handle the state's needs. Starting May 1, all edibles that are sold from a recreational pot business must have been tested for potency. And by Oct. 1, all marijuana products will need to be tested both for potency and contaminants.

The Denver Post has raised questions about the accuracy of some of the testing. And Elliott says there are concerns about whether there will be enough labs to meet the demand. Currently there are three licensed facilities, and three more on the way.

"It’s a huge testing burden," says Elliott.

Since recreational sales became legal in Colorado on Jan. 1, the state has been under tremendous scrutiny. But while there have been some anecdotal incidents of increased emergency room visits and minors accessing pot, there isn't much data.

Elliott says that the lack of incidents should be viewed as a success.

"All the public safety nightmares people said were going to happen, none of them materialized," Elliott says, noting that both traffic fatalities and teen marijuana use both went down in the past few years. Unlike the black-market system through which marijuana is readily available in the rest of the world, he adds, "we now have a system of accountability and transparency."

The biggest safety concern that Elliott and marijuana industry members still have, he says, is that marijuana businesses, no matter how big, can't use banks. They are forced to deal almost exclusively in cash – a situation that could make them attractive targets for criminals.

Critics of legalization say it's far too soon to count Colorado as a success.

Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), a national group that opposes legalization, has started a new website, legalizationviolations.org, that tracks some kinds of incidents in Colorado and Washington State, which has also legalized recreational marijuana. Recent posts speak of Colorado pot crossing into Nebraska and Wyoming and teenagers using vaporizers – a sort of e-cigarette – to discreetly smoke pot in class, since there's no smell or smoke.

"Any steps to reduce access to kids and make it less likely kids will use marijuana is laudable, but I think will ultimately be unsuccessful in the framework of legalization," says Kevin Sabet, the cofounder of Project SAM and director of the Drug Policy Institute at the University of Florida. "Because legalization by definition is the commercialization of marijuana and companies only make money off heavy users, they have to target young people as part of a successful business model."###5115||Empty###5116||Shanghai composite rises as Beijing speeds up China's urbanisation process — AFP pic

HONG KONG, March 17 — China shares rose on Monday, lifted by property and infrastructure counters after Beijing announced plans to speed the pace of urbanisation. The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 1 percent at 2,023.67 points.

The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also rose 1 percent.

Chinese property developers China Vanke and Poly Real Estate gained 3.1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, after the government outlined infrastructure investment plans aimed at raising the proportion of the population living in cities to 60 percent by 2020 from 53.7 percent now. — Reuters###5117||Turkey’s attempt to block access to Twitter appeared to backfire on Friday with many tech-savvy users circumventing the ban and suspicions growing that the prime minister was using court orders to suppress corruption allegations against him and his government.

Turkey’s telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to the social media network hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the website. Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis

Turkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country – to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.

President Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.

“I hope this implementation won’t last long,” he wrote.

Links to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan’s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.

Erdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.

“Prime Minister Erdogan’s move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Andrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain’s Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System – or DNS – blocking, which was easy to work around.

He said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google’s Domain Name System, which isn’t affected by the ban.

Earlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey’s lawyers’ association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey’s main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.

Twitter’s @policy account tweeted: “We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon.”

Earlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or “SMS.”

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey – a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.” Other EU officials also voiced concerns.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey’s minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders – although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy – not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating “personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives” and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

“Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,” Elvan said. “We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.”

Technology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.

The original source of the leaked recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news reports that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

“Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis,” said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch.

In Berlin, the German government’s human rights commissioner, Christoph Straesser, called on Turkey to reverse the decision immediately, saying “limiting freedom of the press and opinion on this scale is unacceptable.”

Britain’s Foreign Office also expressed concern, saying that social media has a “vital role to play” in modern democracy and helps promote transparency and public debate.###5118||Empty###5119||Etowah County’s unemployment rate spiked upward in January, while the state unemployment rate remained steady, according to statistics released Monday by the Alabama Department of Labor.

Etowah County’s unemployment rate spiked upward in January, while the state unemployment rate remained steady, according to statistics released Monday by the Alabama Department of Labor.

Etowah County’s unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in January, up from December’s 5.6 percent.

Every county in the state saw its unemployment rate rise in January.

The state rate, which is seasonally adjusted while county rates are not, remained at 6.1 percent.

The non-seasonally adjusted state unemployment rate would have increased from 5.7 percent in December to 6.8 percent in January.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique that attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns to reveal how employment and unemployment change from month to month.

The county’s unemployment rate dropped for three consecutive months last year before seeing an increase in December.###5120||Pandora will be raising its monthly subscription price by $1 starting in May due to increasing cost of operations that includes licensing fees.

The music streaming service will soon cost $4.99 a month, The Washington Post blog reported via the official Pandora announcement. People who are already subscribing to the premium streaming service will keep the $3.99 rate for now.

Pandora has 3.3 million paid subscribers and 250 million total registered users, according to the company.

The service will also no longer be available at the annual rate of $36, changing to a monthly option only.

Pandora cited costs of royalties as an impetus behind the change. Royalty rates that go to artists through SoundExchange have risen 53 percent in the past five years and are expected to increase 9 percent more next year, according to the Pandora blog.

The streaming service will continue to offer free, customizable listening stations with ads.

Even if users decide to go back to the free streaming option, Pandora will still make money, a report from CNNMoney noted.

Subscription fees brought in $52 million in 2013, only accounting for 12 percent of Pandora's total revenue last year, according to CNNMoney's analysis of the 2013 report.

The company actually makes more profit from users who listen to ads, compared with paid subscribers, Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Company, told CNNMoney.

"That subscription price needs to go up because the value of an hour of advertising is rising," she said. "Raising the price closes the gap of what that person is worth in an ad-driven world."

Pandora's competition, which includes Spotify, iHeart Radio and Rhapsody, continues to grow as streaming services like Apple's iTunes Radio and Beats Music come into the mix.

Despite the rise of similar services, Pandora is still the leader among its competitors and posted a $9 million profit last quarter, its largest since going public in 2011, according to The Washington Post blog.###5121||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

Tango said it raised $280m (£169m, €202m) in a new funding round led by the Chinese firm. Tango's prior investors, Access Industries, venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, also contributed.

The investment gives Alibaba a minority stake in the four-year-old company, estimated at between 20% and 25% by research firm VC Experts. The deal, which values Tango at about $1.1bn, is believed to be Alibaba's biggest investment in a US firm to date.

Tango has 200 million registered users and 70 million active users, with a significant footprint spread across North America, the Middle East, Taiwan and Singapore.

Tango co-founder Eric Setton told Reuters that his company, which offers games, multimedia sharing and other content, would in due course beat WhatsApp, which offers purely text and voice communications.

However the killer potential of apps like Tango and WhatsApp is that they allow users to send free texts or make free calls over a data connection, posing a growing threat to incumbent carriers.

"The platform approach I believe is the winning strategy," Setton said.

"We've now seen it in a number of key markets, with Kakao in Korea or Line in Japan."

Alibaba IPO

Alibaba is understood to have selected New York over Hong Kong for its forthcoming initial public offering.

The gargantuan US flotation is expected to value Alibaba at as much as $120bn (£72bn, €87bn).

Another given is that Alibaba will use the proceeds of the planned share sale to snap up a raft of companies, in a bid to expand its mobile phone services.

Competition

The Tango deal comes a month after social media giant Facebook's shocking $19bn acquisition of five-year old WhatsApp.

Alibaba has long recognised the threat posed by Chinese social media major Tencent's WeChat, a hugely popular messaging app that has evolved into an e-commerce platform.

Alibaba recently introduced a WeChat competitor called Laiwang, but the service has struggled to gain traction.###5123||Mt. Gox has been in the news a lot recently, previously one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, MT. Gox shut down after its customers Bitcoins were stolen.

Now the software which is used to drive Bitcoin transactions has been modified to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen again.

The new Bitcoin Core software has five significant changes to prevent future attacks on the currency, like the one that happened at Mt.Gox, you can see more details below.

“If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version.”

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals###5124||###5125||###5126||Wal-Mart Stores Inc would let US shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could hurt profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares retreated as much a 6 per cent in morning trading, making it one of top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said yesterday its trade-in service would accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp's PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360, and customers could in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam's Club.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US, said in a statement.

The move would see Wal-Mart take on retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, and GameStop, which also offered trade-in programmes for used videogames. Games of the type are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would not likely lose market share, it would be forced to enter into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

"We know that WMT (Walmart) "invests in price" ... and we expect GME (Gamestop) will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share," Schick wrote in a note to clients.

Microsoft shares were up 4.3 per cent and analysts at Barclays hiked the stock's price target to $44 from $43.

''Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365.

The shares are up more than 7 percent on Frankfurt's Xetra.

For full-year 2013, group profit before tax was 7.91 billion euros and the company had delivered 1,963,798 units to customers, up 6.4 percent from 2012, with sales volume growth on nearly all continents.

At the company's Annual Accounts Press Conference, Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG stated, "We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles."

The firm said the pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

According to the company, its Automotive division would again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10 percent, despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies. In 2013, segment EBIT margin was 9.4 percent.

BMW forecast a slight increase in Motorcycles segment sales due to contribution expected from new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs. For 2013, the number of BMW motorcycles delivered to customers were 115,215 units, an increase of 8.3 percent.

In 2014, the Financial Services segment is likely to also remain on growth course, the company said.

BMW stated that its current year forecasts are based on assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

Last week, BMW Group reported a higher fourth-quarter profit on improved volumes. The company forecast further sales volume growth in 2014, and said its board will propose a higher dividend.

The shares are currently trading at 86.39 euros, up 7.02 percent on 3.80 million shares.

Bennett hadn't yet made the two year mark in the role, but clearly, things weren't turning out as the board expected. Symantec didn't give a clear explanation as to exactly why they had parted ways with Bennett – but it did at least say that it wasn't due to any massive faux pas on his behalf.

Chairman of the board Daniel Schulman said: "This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

He also said: "We recognise Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future."

Michael Brown, the chap now temporarily in charge, joined Symantec's board in 2005, and was previously CEO of Quantum Corporation, which doubled its revenue under his stewardship.

Brown said: "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan."###5133||Empty###5134||Few red flags wave more prominently above a corporation than when two things happen: a) earnings and stock prices go south; and b) CEOs seem to be coming and going a little too quickly.

Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo famously have suffered both these maladies. Symantec, the world's largest security software provider, has now stumbled into those footsteps.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based data security and storage provider revealed March 20 that it has terminated the contract of chief executive Steve Bennett (pictured) after 20 months. Bennett, who came to Symantec as a board member in 2010 after CEO-ing Intuit to a $3 billion sales year, also resigned from the company's board of directors.

Board member Michael Brown will serve as interim CEO while the company, best known for its Norton antivirus and BackupExec software, begins its search for a permanent day-to-day leader.

Stock Price Took Big Hit

Investors were not pleased by the development. The stock closed at $20.91 March 21 but plummeted 13 percent to $18.20 in after-hours trading.

A number of industry analysts declared that they were surprised by the announcement. Symantec itself, however, contended that Bennett's exit was something the company had discussed for some months and did not happen as a result of anything inappropriate on his part.

The reason Bennett was shooed out of his corner office so early in his tenure goes way beyond his personal on-the-job performance. Bennett has long proven himself to be a competent corporate CEO; he just wasn't the right one for this job. In fact, few people on Earth are right for this job. The company is the one with serious and deep-seated problems.

In its simplest terms, Symantec is a well-established enterprise that didn't heed key trends and let new-gen IT slip by when it needed to retool several years ago. Its core business is protecting data and apps on desktop and laptop PCs; it didn't move quickly enough to invest in other lines of business when PC sales started slipping five years ago.

Symantec also didn't move to the cloud quickly enough; some of its older competitors moved faster to build products that use it. Symantec only recently cloud-ized its product line, and it's having issues getting customers to buy into the new products.

Asleep at the Wheel?

More than one person had been asleep at the wheel long before Bennett arrived.

There are multiple sides to this story, of course. Like many old-school IT vendors, Symantec has built-in problems marshaling a large global installed base in the small and midsize enterprise market. It's extremely difficult to get all those customers to pay for regular upgrades to their software when they often think it's not required. Microsoft has, um, a modicum of experience in this department.

The other major problem is the type of IT in which Symantec plays. No sector evolves faster or more thoroughly than security, which is always chasing the bad guys and never—and we do mean NEVER—getting ahead of them so as to cut them off at the pass.

As a result, a great many new, less-expensive and more agile competitors from places like Eastern Europe and Israel have sprung up, and Symantec has been taking hits as a result.

Insider Perspective

One of those competitors is Justin Moore, CEO of Axcient. The company has a well-known billboard up on the Bayshore Freeway—Interstate 101, which traverses the center of Silicon Valley and connects San Francisco on the north with San Jose on the south—that says: "R.I.P. Symantec BackupExec.cloud; Axcient Beyond Backup."

While it's clear where Moore's loyalties lie, he also provides some cogent storage-business insider perspective.

"When Steve Bennett turned around Intuit in his tenure from 2000 to 2007, the company's problem was mainly a core business and processes challenge. However, Symantec is different; the company has a technology problem," Moore told eWEEK.

"Bennett was given a year and half to turn around a company that has much deeper challenges that relate to how it has been viewing technology, which is the core of its business. When Bennett announced his vision for Symantec 4.0, which was announced less than a year ago, he made the right choices—for the most part. Yet, Symantec was already too far behind the cloud/SaaS (software-as-a-service) curve to catch up. A change of this magnitude is impossible in less than 3 to 5 years," Moore said.

Corporate Errors Add Up

Symantec is pinning the failure on Bennett—when, in reality, the core of its failing stems from decisions made years ago, Moore said.

"Symantec lacks product focus and has spread itself too thin over a variety of product lines that spans security, productivity, protection, information management, business continuity and storage in the consumer and enterprise market. Like so many other enterprise software companies, it has struggled to transition to the enterprise cloud world proving that it is indeed a systemic issue that goes far beyond Bennett's control. Given his spectacular overhaul of Intuit's business, Bennett was the right person to tackle Symantec and had shown bold ideas to fix the company, but was ultimately thrown out by Symantec's stubbornness and shortsighted approach to its technological challenges," Moore said.

Symantec has struggled in recent years against new-gen security companies such as Axcient, Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, crafted in an effort to become a serious data storage player, was widely critiqued as a mistake. Symantec's sales have been treading water for several years.

Leadership Turnover Since 2005

Symantec's leadership turnover issues started back in 2005, when the company merged with storage provider Veritas to combine it with the Norton data protection product line. Co-CEOs John Thompson (then incumbent at Symantec) and Gary Bloom (from Veritas) didn't exactly see eye-to-eye on how to run the company, and Bloom soon left for other ventures. He now heads up database maker MarkLogic.

Thompson, who was on the short list to be Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration in 2008, left in 2009 to do start up Virtual Instruments and is now chairman of the board of Microsoft. He was replaced by longtime Symantec executive Enrique Salem.

However, the well-rounded Salem also was deposed as CEO a mere three years later (2012) in favor of Bennett. Now Bennett's out the door after less than two years.

In its requisite thank you statement using Chairman Daniel Schulman's name, the board said: "We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness.

Oracle reported per-share earnings of 68 cents on revenue of $9.3 billion. That compares with the 70 cents on $9.4 billion that analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had predicted.

Oracle shares rose 62 cents, or 1.65 percent, during the regular session, and closed at $38.22 a share. The shares have risen by about 28 percent since hitting a recent low in June.

New software licenses rose by four percent. Hardware sales rose by eight percent. Software license updates and product support revenues rose five percent to $4.6 billion.

Oracle said it expects to report earnings of 92 to 99 cents a share in Q4, which is more or less in line with the consensus view of 96 cents. It says it expects overall sales to grow between three and seven percent, but that’s assuming the currency environment stays where it is today, which it won’t.

Speaking of currencies, Oracle took a hit on revenue growth thanks — or no thanks — to the stronger US dollar. After backing out the effect of currencies, Oracle said its sales would have grown by 10 percent, not four percent and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis would have grown by seven percent instead of five percent.

In a statement, Oracle President Mark Hurd said bookings for cloud applications rose by 60 percent and are now on a run-rate to $300 million per quarter. On a conference call with analysts, Hurd called it the “best quarter ever,” for Oracle’s cloud business.

On the call CEO Larry Ellison talked about an up-and-coming cloud infrastructure business that will compete with Amazon Web Services and IBM Softlayer. Ellison said the service will be priced competitively with AWS. He went on to say Oracle sees it as a commodity business and that’s in his words, “not a bad thing.”

While Amazon is still the king in terms of raw computing capacity and while IBM has argued — not persuasively — that it’s the biggest cloud company by revenue Oracle will try to flood the zone and take some business away from both of them.###5136||Empty###5137||NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade in their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores.

Starting next week, customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam”s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

The world”s largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market. It”s a business that”s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world”s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart”s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers for in return for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games. The latter was an apparent reference to GameStop”s program.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They”ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think the move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn”t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

And Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pointed out that GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it”s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers” grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer”s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###5138||What would you get if you combined your income tax filing with the health history form you fill out at your doctor’s office?

An application for Obamacare.

While improvements in the federal website have made the enrollment process smoother, it could never be called “easy.” That’s because it asks for lots of personal and financial data at the same time it requires decisions about health care.

Is it more important to save money or have access to the doctor you’ve been seeing for years? Would you rather pay more in monthly premiums for a policy that had lower co-pays, or have lower premiums and higher co-pays? And looking into that crystal ball you brought along just in case, how much do you think you’ll make this year?

With just 12 days left to buy private health insurance through the federal website, the easiest way to get through the process may be to have someone guide you through the journey.

Those people have a name — “navigators” — and they’re scattered around the state, ready to help.

One way to find them is to click the “Find Local Help” button on HealthCare.gov. By typing in your ZIP code, you can see what groups and institutions have federal grants to provide help.

Another route would be to call your local hospital. Many are offering enrollment guidance themselves, or know where to find such help nearby. Check njha.com/reform to see a list of sign-up sessions scheduled between now and March 31, the deadline to purchase private insurance through the federal exchange.

There are two enrollment offices in the northern part of the state that work directly with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If you have a complicated set of circumstances, it may be worth the ride to consult them. The Edison enrollment assistance center is at 1719 State Route 27, Festival Plaza, (732-484-9710). The Wayne center is at 1211 Hamburg Turnpike, Suite 301, (201-414-0465).

Both centers are open seven days a week.

Another option is to consult a local insurance broker who handles health insurance. While agents typically handle small business accounts, they can handle individuals as well, said David Oscar, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters. Their help is free to clients; agents ultimately get paid by the insurance carrier for sending business its way.

You can locate a nearby agent at njahu.org.

Even with the help of a trained professional, the experts say to plan on spending at least 90 minutes on the process — longer if you’re enrolling on behalf of a large family.

The most difficult part may be “reading the questions thoroughly and not reading them too fast,” said Oscar. Some of the questions are silly, he said, such as the one asking about the pregnancy status of all females in the household, including infants.

That’s why it helps to gather all the information you need before you apply, whether that application is by phone (800-318-2596), computer (HealthCare.gov), or face-to-face:

• Not just your Social Security number, but the numbers of everyone you’re signing up for, including small children. (You don’t need proof of your Social Security number; you just need to know what it is.)

• If you are a permanent resident, bring your green card.

• If you are switching from a policy you have but don’t like, bring that policy number and company name.

• Something that helps document your income, whether it’s your taxes for last year, or better yet, recent pay stubs. You will be required to state your best guess for what you’ll earn in 2014, and the more accurate your prediction, the better, say tax advisers.###5139||Toyota May Sign $1B Deal To End Fed Acceleration Probe

* Board member Michael Brown to take over as interim CEO

* Reaffirms fourth-quarter outlook

* Shares fall 10 pct in extended trading (Adds details, analysts’ comments)

By Soham Chatterjee

March 20 (Reuters) - Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” the company said.

“It’s a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company’s turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5 percent organic growth and higher than 30 percent adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5 percent revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.

Symantec had been reorganizing its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

“Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list,” Ives said.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

The company named board member Michael Brown to lead while the company seeks Bennett's replacement.

A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, the company said on Thursday (Friday morning Australian time).

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem's ousting in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record slump in PC sales curbs spending on Symantec's anti-virus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock has tumbled 15 per cent in the past year.

Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.###5144||Iowa’s unemployment rate went up slightly in January.

Walmart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products – from canned beans to dishwashing soap – with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form of a store credit.

Additional Photos Walmart has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store →

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called Savings Catcher, on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could not only change the way people shop, but also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Citibank launched a similar program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if Citibank finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Walmart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it’s successful, others may follow.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

After sending queries to some of Walmart’s competitors, it wasn’t clear Friday afternoon whether they planned to follow the move. And Walmart did not immediately answer questions about why it does not compare online prices.

Walmart’s U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health.

For the new tool, a customer has to set up an account on www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately.

###5160||In the latest funding round for the popular do-it-yourself property rental market, Airbnb has reportedly been valued at US$10bn as it closes a US$500m funding round – a valuation that would make unicorns'(companies valued at more than US$1bn) eyes water.

Airbnb, which has offices in Dublin, is the latest in a number of born-on-the-internet companies to be valued at US$10bn.

According to reports in The Wall Street Journal and New York Times, private equity firm TPG is leading a round of between US$400m and US$500m.

Airbnb is one of 30 companies that now have a valuation in the region of US$10bn.

To give a sense of perspective, Chinese mobile maker Xiaomi and cloud storage player Dropbox are valued at US$10bn, software and services player Palantir is valued at US$9bn, rocket player SpaceX is valued at US$4.8bn, music player Spotify is valued at US$4bn, Pinterest is valued at US$3.8bn, and Uber is valued at US$3.8bn.

Airbnb, which Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharcyk founded in 2008, allows people to rent out apartments and homes online. More than 600,000 properties are listed on the site at the moment.

The company was valued at US$2.5bn in 2012 and has so far raised up to US$300m.###5161||Why did this happen?

They don't know who they are, they don't know what they want to do, and that's infiltrating all the way through their organization. J.J. Thompson,

CEO, Rook Security

Much of Bennett's time at Big Yellow was spent implementing what he termed the Symantec 4.0 strategy, which mostly focused on paring back products, services and staff. Though Symantec's stock price more than doubled during his first year, Bennett was unable to maintain that momentum; the stock price has dipped 15% in the past year. Similarly, sales of Symantec's line of consumer products, headlined by its Norton-branded endpoint antimalware technology, declined 2.8% in 2013, a foreboding statistic considering how closely linked the company's brand is with traditional endpoint security.

Chris Rodriguez, network security senior industry analyst at San Antonio, Texas-based consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, said that while Symantec has products in emerging security product segments, such as the high-growth mobile space, the company has struggled to compete against a myriad of upstarts. In mobile, for instance, Rodriguez said security technology from rivals Avast Software and Lookout Inc. is just as effective and often much cheaper, if not free.

'Bloated' Symantec facing deep-rooted issues Despite those obvious headwinds, a variety of experts told SearchSecurity that the root of Symantec's issues runs much deeper than Bennett, and that much more than a new CEO will be needed to steer the company in the right direction. Kevin McDonald, executive vice president for Irvine, Calif.-based managed IT services provider Alvaka Networks, said that the security industry has largely recognized that "Symantec was synonymous with bloated," from the company's software to its staff. While calling the decision to fire Bennett a "mind-blower," McDonald admitted the company may not have innovated enough to stave off emerging powerhouse rivals such as FireEye Inc. that are focused on detecting advanced attacks at the network level. Still, he predicted that the next Symantec CEO would benefit greatly from the moves that Bennett made. "I felt like there was finally stability in the company and they had somebody that knew how to look at the overall operation and make it work," McDonald said. "Bottom line is I felt like Bennett was paring back some of the bloat, and then expanding in the places he felt they needed to." John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the Bethesda, Md.-based SANS Institute and the former long-time lead security analyst for Gartner Inc., said that many of the issues Bennett faced during his tenure as Symantec CEO actually had much deeper roots, going back to John W. Thompson's leadership of the company from 1999 to 2009. Pescatore said Thompson set the tone for the company as it expanded into a variety of markets beyond information security. Pescatore noted that Microsoft's entry into the antivirus market threatened Symantec's core revenue stream. That trend continued under Bennett's predecessor, Enrique Salem, with the company soon providing everything from storage services to desktop management.###5165||Empty###5166||* Dollar rises against yen and euro before Fed policy decision

* Fed expected to continue tapering its bond-buying stimulus

* Focus on UK jobs data, annual budget (Updates levels, adds comments)

By Anirban Nag

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen and euro on Wednesday, drawing comfort from expectations the Federal Reserve will further unwind monetary stimulus, looking beyond the impact on the economy of a harsh winter.

Some trepidation before Janet Yellen’s inaugural policy review as Federal Reserve chief will keep gains muted, traders said.

The Fed is widely expected to reduce the size of its monthly bond purchase programme by a further $10 billion at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Yellen, widely regarded as a dove, is due to address a news conference later in the day.

Most are focused on the Fed’s forward guidance on policy. Most expect it to assure investors that rate hikes are a long way off despite the unemployment rate easing faster than expected.

The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 101.625 yen, staying above a one-month low of 101.20 yen hit on March 3. The euro fetched $1.3917, down 0.1 percent on the day but not far from Thursday’s peak of $1.3967 - a 2-1/2-year high.

“The key thing will be whether there will be any change in the timing of rate hikes by the Fed from next year,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.

“I am not convinced the Fed is ready to materially change guidance and we will see a very even-handed Yellen. All of which leaves investors looking to second-quarter U.S. data before taking fresh positions in the dollar.”

The Fed has said it would not raise interest rates until joblessness fell to at least 6.5 percent, a pledge policymakers thought would hold until at least mid-2015. But it hit a five-year low of 6.6 percent in January, before rising to 6.7 percent in February.

Expectations Yellen will pursue a broadly dovish stance have helped rein in U.S. Treasury yields, which in turn has undermined the attraction of the dollar for bond investors.

“Many investors had probably expected the dollar to strengthen this year because the U.S. economy looked in better shape than others,” said Katsunori Kitakura, associate general manager of market making at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.

“But their positioning has probably been damaged by the Ukraine crisis and poor economic data due to bad weather, and that’s probably a reason for the dollar’s struggles recently.”

UK FOCUS

Some of the focus in Europe will be on the British pound. It was up 0.1 percent at $1.6615, with more gains likely if UK jobs data at 0930 GMT shows more signs of robust recovery.

The number of people out of work is expected to have fallen by another 25,000. Wages are expected to have risen 1.2 percent year-on-year - an increase but well below inflation.

“Attention will be on wage growth and that along with a good jobs number could push sterling higher,” said CIBC’s Stretch.

Later, attention will shift to the annual UK budget. Finance minister George Osborne is expected to stick to his tough plan to fix the public finances and this will keep the onus on the Bank of England to keep monetary policy loose to ensure growth.

And while the safe-haven yen lost ground, investors remained cautious over tensions in Ukraine. Anxiety eased somewhat after Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine, a day after Crimean citizens voted to be annexed by Moscow.

The proposal ties compensation for chief executive John Martin to wider access to the drug maker’s popular roster of HIV and hepatitis C treatments.

The shareholder resolution from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has previously lambasted Gilead and other drug makers over their pricing, was proposed in response to the recently approved Sovaldi pill for hepatitis C. Gilead priced its medicine at $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, which works out to $1,000 a day. As a result, AHF maintains that Sovaldi will be unaffordable for some patients.

Such concerns, in fact, prompted the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee to ask Gilead to explain the rationale behind its pricing. In a letter sent yesterday to the drug maker, the lawmakers worry that Sovaldi pricing may be too high for patients with public or private insurance. A report released last week by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that is supported, in part, by insurers, forecast that Sovaldi may negatively burden health-care budgets.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.

Symantec stock was down 6.5% in after-hours trading, after the announcement. Symantec stock rose 1.6% in the regular session stock market today, closing at 20.91. The stock is down more than 25% since early August.

Director Michael Brown was appointed interim CEO while the company searches for a new leader. Brown joined Symantec's board in July 2005 and formerly served as CEO at Quantum.

Bennett joined Symantec as a board member in February 2010 and became chairman in August 2011. Bennett was named CEO and president in July 2012.

In January, when the company reported a third consecutive quarter of EPS growth acceleration, Bennett told analysts on a conference call that costs had come down because of "lower spending and increased organizational efficiency."

But sales fell 5% in fiscal Q3 ended Dec. 27, the second consecutive quarterly decline.

The company in January 2013 split the roles of CEO and chairman, electing board member Schulman to the latter position.

"Separating the positions of chairman and CEO allows me to focus on executing the company's strategic plan and managing the company's operations and performance," Bennett said in a statement at the time.

In an early February Q&A with IBD, Bennett was asked how things were going after most salespeople had been given new territory assignments.

"When you make that kind of big change, it creates some challenges, and we're still working through those," Bennett said then. "We'll be anxious to see how much progress we make in the fourth quarter. The pipeline looks solid."

Symantec is slated to report results for its fiscal Q4 ended on or near March 31 on May 7.

In answer to another question in the Q&A, Bennett was candid about the company's challenges, saying, "We're making the hard decision to position the company to win in the long term and taking a little short-term pain to reposition the company."

Of the biggest 30 banks, only Zions Bancorp failed to meet the capital minimum required to survive a crisis.

“The largest banking institutions in the United States are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement.

While it’s safe to say that banks are safer, they’re far from reformed says Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the IMF and a professor of entrepreneurship at MIT.

Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Aaron Task sat down with Johnson at The Atlantic Economy Summit earlier this week (before the stress test results were announced) to discuss the state of U.S. banks.

“We need to keep moving the ball on this issue,” Johnson tells Task. “U.S. banks are supposed to produce a living will that shows how they should be broken up. I think there are many [government] officials who are questioning whether this exercise is being taken seriously by the banks and whether the banks are capable of demonstrating that they could fail without any government involvement.”

It appears that the big banks have moved away with from 2008 crisis and subsequent LIBOR controversies relatively scot-free. No executives were jailed, bank stocks and profits are nearing all-time highs and compensation for bank CEOs are approaching 2007 levels.

“There was an idea in 2005-2006 that banks had moved to some sort of new level in terms of technology and a philosophical understanding of the risks of finance and nobody says that anymore,” says Johnson. “Now they’re regarded as being very big political players, bullies in their markets, and people who behave inappropriately when given the opportunity. So that’s how they’re seen today which is quite different.”

But does that lead to improved policy and tighter constraints? “That remains to be seen,” says Johnson.

He announced Monday that over a half-million jobs have been created in the last three years, as the unemployment continues to drop.

Scott said in Monday’s press release that Florida’s unemployment rate for January, 2014 was the state’s lowest since June, 2008 — 6.1 percent, 0.5 percent below the official national rate. Statewide unemployment has held below the national rate since August, 2013, and since December, 2010, Florida has created 503,500 private sector jobs.

“With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we’re making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida,” Scott said in a press release. “We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let’s keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one.”

Every March, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. The benchmark revisions represent an annual change in the level of employment or re-anchoring of survey estimates to actual employment counts from Reemployment Assistance tax records. This process also introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates. The benchmarked 2013 jobs data showed that the state created more private sector jobs than were originally estimated. Nearly 200,000 new private sector jobs were added in 2013 alone.

“With a five point drop in the statewide unemployment rate and more than 500,000 new private sector jobs created since December 2010, we have another successful chapter in Florida’s economic turnaround story” Jesse Panuccio, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity said. “More Florida families are getting back to work across the state, and there is still more work to do to foster an opportunity economy for Florida’s present and future generations.”

SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) – Drought-plagued California will ease some protection for fish in the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, officials said Tuesday, a move expected to make more water available for farming and ease political tensions in an election year.

SPONSORED

The move marks a retreat from restrictions imposed earlier in the year which had widely been expected to be tightened further, rather than eased, and was welcomed in the agricultural community.

“California’s agriculture is critical to the world’s food supply,” said assemblywoman Kristin Olsen, who represents part of the San Joaquin Valley, who had lobbied hard against the restrictions. “An inability to produce that food would clearly be devastating to health and human safety not only in California but around the globe.”

Citing recent rains, regulators said Tuesday there was enough water in the state’s reservoirs now to partially ease restrictions.

“We were quite concerned at that time about the issue of public health and safety,” Tom Howard, executive director of the state Water Resources Control Board, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “This really had the markings of a historic drought.”

The move comes after weeks of intensive lobbying from growers, lawmakers from agricultural regions and the state’s two U.S. Senators, who said the restrictions, along with the possible curtailment of water rights for some agricultural and municipal customers, would harm the state’s economy.

The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of a drought that may still turn out to be one of the worst in its history despite storms that brought rain and snow last week, leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water and possibly forcing farmers to leave fallow a half-million acres of land.

Recent storms dropped nearly a foot of rain in some areas, boosting reservoir levels and the snowpack that the state relies on for drinking water in the spring, but still leaving supplies way below normal for this time of year.

Earlier this month, concern that the state was about to restrict water supplies to farmers even further swept through the agricultural community, spurring intensive pushback and a series of tense meetings with water regulators in the administration of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

“We are very concerned that if the current proposal as reported to us is enacted, it will have significant near- and long-term effects on the California economy and, more importantly, will not achieve the desired water supply security intended,” U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jim Costa and John Garamendi, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to the water board.

CUTBACKS STILL POSSIBLE

Under the new rules announced Tuesday, which Howard said may be modified again next month, the two massive public water projects responsible for pumping in the delta will be able to deliver it to farmers and others, once the state determines that there is enough flowing to meet the health and sanitation needs of residents.

Scott Shapiro, an attorney specializing in water issues for the Sacramento firm Downey Brand, said expanding the allowable uses of tight water supplies was not just important for farmers.

“It’s not just for agriculture, because there are other needs that may be contracted for that go beyond health and safety,” Shapiro said. “It could include other municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.

In addition to allowing more of the water pumped from the delta to be used for purposes other than meeting health and safety needs, the state planned to reduce by about a third the amount of water that the projects were required to leave in the delta as a way of protecting fish, Howard said during the press briefing.

But he cautioned that the state could still implement severe cutbacks to the water rights of many users if dry conditions continue.

Environmental groups, long critical of what they say is over-use of the state’s limited water resources for farming in dry areas, did not immediately respond to the rules change.

Mark Cowin, director water resources for the state, said that fish and wildlife experts consulted by his department said that endangered species in the delta would not be harmed by the looser rules.

The shares are up more than 7 percent on Frankfurt's Xetra.

For full-year 2013, group profit before tax was 7.91 billion euros and the company had delivered 1,963,798 units to customers, up 6.4 percent from 2012, with sales volume growth on nearly all continents.

At the company's Annual Accounts Press Conference, Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG stated, "We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles."

The firm said the pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

According to the company, its Automotive division would again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10 percent, despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies. In 2013, segment EBIT margin was 9.4 percent.

BMW forecast a slight increase in Motorcycles segment sales due to contribution expected from new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs. For 2013, the number of BMW motorcycles delivered to customers were 115,215 units, an increase of 8.3 percent.

In 2014, the Financial Services segment is likely to also remain on growth course, the company said.

BMW stated that its current year forecasts are based on assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

Last week, BMW Group reported a higher fourth-quarter profit on improved volumes. The company forecast further sales volume growth in 2014, and said its board will propose a higher dividend.

The shares are currently trading at 86.39 euros, up 7.02 percent on 3.80 million shares.

Business News###5187||BRUSSELS: EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord Thursday on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy.

Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People's Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP's Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the eurozone's 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long.###5188||Russia's SMP Bank says that Visa and MasterCard have stopped processing transactions for its clients after the US imposed sanctions on its major shareholders.

On Thursday SMP Bank's owners - brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - were among 20 Russians hit by US sanctions after president Vladimir Putin moved to annex the region of Crimea.



Within hours and without notification, card giants Visa and MasterCard reacted by cutting off payment services for SMP customers.



In a statement to Reuters, the bank says: "Due to the fact that the sanctions were imposed on shareholders and not on the bank, we consider the moves by the payment systems unlawful and we are confident that we can resolve the encountered difficulties in the near future."



Arkady Rotenberg has close tie with Putin, dating back to when the pair were members of the same judo club. The US says that the brothers have given "support to Putin's pet projects" and received billions of dollars in contracts related to the recent Sochi Olympic Games.



The 20 people targeted in the latest round of sanctions have "substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership," says president Barack Obama.



A financial institution, Bank Rossiya, has also been hit and will be frozen out of dollar transactions.

Today the UK Royal Mint has unveiled the new £1 coin that has been in development for some time and now includes new security features such as a bi-metalic construction and a 12 sided two colour design.

The new £1 coin also includes the Royal Mint’s new iSIS technology, or Integrated Secure Identification System. The iSIS technology comprises of three tiers of banknote-strength security enabling the coin to be authenticated using high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle reducing the likelihood of forgeries slipping into the cash system.

A public design competition for the new £1 coin will be held at a later date to choose the design for the reverse, or ‘tails’, of the coin. The new £1 coin is expected to be introduced in 2017.

“The new £1 coin also pays a fitting tribute to Britain’s heritage. It is the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny bit, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971.

The threepenny bit was in the first group of coins ever to feature the portrait of HRH Queen Elizabeth II.

The new version coined in 1953 bore a design of a Tudor chained portcullis, which was inherited by the 1p piece after decimalisation and remains on the coin today, as well as being the badge of the Palace of Westminster.

The threepenny bit was the first British coin to use a 12-sided shape which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War, as its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during the blackout.

By the time of decimalisation 1.2 billion had been issued for circulation.”

* United States, EU impose sanctions on Russia

* Euro firm despite Russia crisis, seen as safe haven

By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Michael Connor

NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors saw as modest economic sanctions against Russia and Ukraine following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow.

The dollar, often a shelter for investors against global stresses, was also down, with the dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, off 0.13 percent to 79.345 in afternoon trading.

“The market thinks, it’s not so bad,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets Online Trading in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. “You don’t see any signs of play against the euro. If the sanctions were serious, say against Russia’s oil and gas exports, you’d see selling of the euro because they don’t have much alternative for energy.”

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion in major markets. The absence of military conflict between the two countries also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia’s military incursion into Crimea. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, will impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday.

“The sanctions don’t sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In late New York trading, the dollar was up 0.3 percent against the yen at 101.66 yen, rising after four days of losses driven by investors buying the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.5 percent to 141.51 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.392, despite data showing a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe’s common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro’s strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn’t weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.2 percent versus the franc at 1.2159.###5195||Empty###5196||Guy Bentley

Troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox has said it has found 200,000 Bitcoin worth roughly £70m.

Chief executive of the company Mark Karpeles said the Bitcoin were found in an online wallet, which MtGox believed held none of the digital currency.

The exchange said:

MtGox had certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any Bitcoins. On March 7, 2014, Mt.Gox confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC.



In February, MtGox suspended trading and took its website offline, as well as erasing the company's twitter account. MtGox lost approximately 750,000 Bitcoin - close to seven per cent of all Bitcoin in circulation. The exchange had been plagued by the transaction malleability problem.

10 days ago the company received some welcome news as a Texas judge temporarily halted two US lawsuits, while bankruptcy proceedings continue in Japan.

In February, MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said it had an outstanding debt of $63m (£37m).

MtGox will return to court 1 April to attempt to extend the shielding of its asset's until the Japanese case is concluded.###5197||× Walmart now accepting used video games as trade for gift cards

NEW YORK – Walmart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept an unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age.

Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted.

The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, Duncan Mac Naughton said, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade-in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives.

Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.###5198||Oracle reports its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and analysts have hopes for a good quarter.

They are expecting 4% growth in revenue over the year-ago quarter, and EPS to be $0.70, up from $0.65.

If the company exceeds these targets, it will be a two-in-a-row beat.

Oracle could really use that. It missed revenue expectations for the prior three quarters in a row, an almost unheard of series of misses for the company as it struggled to stop its hardware business from shrinking.

With revenue soft, Oracle spent most of 2013 in cost-cutting mode. That meant that many Oracle employees didn't get their bonuses, Wall analyst analyst Steve Koenig, of Wedbush said in a research note published last week:

"Our checks suggest FY13 bonuses were trimmed or eliminated for many employees across the company , which augurs wells for cost control, but not so much for ORCL's ability to attract and retain talent."

Koenig clarified to Business Insider, "It's anecdotal, but we heard from more employees that they are not getting their fiscal '13 bonuses, which ended [last] May. And it seems that that sort of thing is more frequent than it has been in the past. [This affects] people in marketing, internal development, etc."

The company has been beefing up its revenue numbers with cloud acquisitions. However Koenig says that once those acquisitions get absorbed, Oracle hasn't been making much hay with them.

"Some of the SaaS acquisitions they've done don't look they are generating a whole lot of growth. I've heard that RightNow is doing really well, but I conclude that Taleo is probably not growing well," he says. Oracle bought customer service cloud RightNow for $1.5 billion in 2011 and bought human resource cloud Taleo for $1.9 billion in 2012.

He says that if you strip out the revenue from whatever cloud acquisition Oracle has most recently completed, "cloud revenue out stays flat."

Still, Koenig isn't panning the stock altogether. He maintains a "neutral" rating and target price of $40. The stock is trading at about $38 now.

He thinks Oracle is going to beat consensus expectations tomorrow, and that it's doing an especially good job in selling its the latest version of its bread-and-butter product, the database. Oracle released a new version of its database, 12c, last summer. 12c is designed for cloud computing applications, an area where enterprises are investing heavily.

Oracle declined comment.###5199||Empty###5200||Empty###5201||Empty###5202||Why did this happen?

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.###5204||Michael de la Merced by Airbnb is poised to join the 11-digit club. The company, which was created nearly six years ago as a way to help people find spare rooms and couches to sleep on, is in advanced talks to raise more than $US400 million in capital, a round of financing that would value it at more than $US10 billion, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday. Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology start-up firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing start-ups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday. But Airbnb, a centrepiece of what has become known as “the sharing economy," is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords in big cities, as well. Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added.

The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are continuing and may still fall apart, these people cautioned. Advertisement

Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $US170 billion — paid more than $US16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $US8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged," said Colin C. Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out." Others view the valuation race more sceptically.

“We’re seeing valuations go nuts," said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr. Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.

Under the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations.###5205||MORE debris has been spotted in the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

The French images show more objects in the southern corridor, a huge stretch of ocean towards Antarctica. This covers the path the plane could have taken if it headed south but it is not known how close to the other sightings – by Australia and Chine – the latest objects are. The Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement today: "This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor. "Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

This is the third promising discovery as the international search enters its third week. Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein was yesterday given a hand written note in the middle of his daily press briefing. China spotted the 74ft by 42ft piece of debris via satellite images. It was 75 miles south west of an earlier sighting by Australia. Six aircraft had already covered 13,900 square miles of ocean south west of Perth in Australia in the hunt for the plane. Investigators are also looking into claims that the captain of the missing flight, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, received a two-minute long call from a mystery woman shortly before take-off. Suspicions have been raised because the call was made from a Pay as You Go SIM card obtained recently under a false identity.

There are fears that the discovery backs up claims Captain Zaharie, 53, had possible links to terror groups, who frequently use untraceable SIM cards to avoid detection. It has been claimed he is a supporter of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was jailed for five years in a controversial court hearing which took place just hours before the missing flight departed. The Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur at 12.40am on March 8 and went missing half an hour into the fight to Beijing. It disappeared off military radar altogether at 2.15am. Authorities also face a race against time to locate the plane's black box voice and data recorder, which transmits an electronic signal for just 30 days before running out of battery. The family of the 239 people on the aircraft are frustrated with the lack of information they are receiving.###5206||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals###5217||(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

“We know that WMT “invests in price” ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,” Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.###5218||Walmart is getting into the video game trade-in business once again. Starting March 26, Walmart will start accepting used games for Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles at more than 3,100 U.S. Walmart locations.

For your aging game to qualify, you must bring in a working disc in its original packaging to Walmart's electronics department. After the game disc is checked for cracks and deep scratches, you'll receive a price quote for the amount Walmart is willing to pay.

Accepted games will receive their trade-in value in eGift cards that can be used at Walmart and Sam's club locations and online. Walmart's gift card policy is in line with other video game trade-in retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and Gamestop.

This is the second time Walmart has ventured into the used video game market, but the first time the company has managed the entire operation itself. In 2009, Walmart partnered with e-Play to bring automated video game trade-in kiosks into select Walmart stores in the U.S. The venture lasted less than a year, however, coming to an abrupt end in February 2010 after e-Play suspended operations, according to Joystiq.

This time around, Walmart wants to get its attempt at used games right and is launching with a more expansive program than the 80-store trial market with e-Play.

"With more than 110 million gamers in the U.S., we see enormous potential in the $2 billion pre-owned video game business opportunity," Walmart said in a blog post Tuesday.

Walmart didn't specify in its announcement exactly which console platforms its trade-in program will support. But Walmart Spokesperson Sarah McKinney told us the company will accept any game from any platform as long as the game has market value.

Walmart will start accepting games next Wednesday, but it doesn't plan on selling the used games in its stores until this summer. Used games will be sold at Walmart locations and online.

This article has been updated to include Sarah McKinney's statement.

By Phil Wahba

March 19 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday called on eBay Inc to sell 20 percent of its PayPal payments unit in an initial public offering, a change in tack from his previous call for a complete spinoff.

Icahn in January called for eBay to hive off its fast growing PayPal business, arguing the unit is undervalued as part of eBay.

In recent weeks, Icahn has sent a series of open letters critical of eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe, the board, and corporate governance at the e-commerce company.

In his latest missive to fellow eBay shareholders, he said selling off only part of PayPal would retain the benefits of a stand-alone PayPal while maintaining the efficiencies of having eBay and PayPal together.

“A partial separation of PayPal is not a new idea, and we’re glad to see that Mr. Icahn now seems to agree that a full separation of PayPal is not a good idea,” eBay said in a statement, re-iterating its position that the two businesses are better off under the same umbrella.

As a public company, the payments firm should also command a higher valuation than as part of a larger corporation, shedding the “conglomerate discount,” Icahn said. Its stock could then also be used to bankroll future acquisitions.

“Conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal - and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses - will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,” said Icahn, who owns more than 2 percent of eBay.

EBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002.

The billionaire Icahn said eBay and PayPal could enter into a long-term commercial contract that does not require eBay to own all of PayPal, to preserve their ties.

He also said PayPal has a significant opportunity to offer new services such as check writing and direct deposits.

A standalone PayPal and eBay would benefit from having their own independent management teams, Icahn argued.

PayPal needs to be independent to compete in the mobile payments industry, Icahn said, repeating an assertion he has frequently made in a series of open letters in recent weeks.

Twitter users in Turkey report that the social media site has been blocked in the country.

Some users trying to open the twitter.com website are apparently being redirected to a statement by Turkey's telecommunications regulator.

It cites a court order to apply "protection measures" on the website.

This comes after PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "wipe out Twitter" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle.

The BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul reports that he is unable to access Twitter.

"I don't care what the international community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic," Mr Erdogan said earlier on Thursday.

He spoke after some users had posted documents reportedly showing evidence of corruption relating to the prime minister - a claim he denies.

His office said that Twitter had not responded to Turkey's court rulings to remove some links, forcing Ankara to act.

Twitter has so far made no public comment on the issue.

There are about 10m Twitter users across Turkey.

In 2010, the country lifted its ban on YouTube - two years after it blocked access to the website because of videos deemed insulting to the country's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.###5223||Most of the passengers of flight MH0318, which now flies the route to Beijing taken by missing flight MH0370, have fallen asleep after the snack service at 2 a.m., March 22, 2014.

© 2014, The New York Times News Service

The night sky was clear above the clouds, and the last glimmer of a setting half-moon had faded when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, cruising at 35,000 feet over the Gulf of Thailand, approached the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace on its usual route to Beijing. What happened next should have been routine for a twice-daily milk run between two of Asia's most important cities. Air traffic controllers outside Kuala Lumpur usually hand the jet off to their counterparts in Ho Chi Minh City as the flight turns northeast toward the Chinese capital.But in those early hours of March 8, pilots flying nearby heard an unusual crescendo of chatter on the radio frequencies used by radar control in Vietnam and Malaysia. Air traffic personnel in both countries were trying and failing to reach the plane."Any stations in contact with Malaysian 370, please relay."Vietnamese and Malaysian controllers asked one aircraft after another to radio the jet. Pilots listened as one plane after another tried and heard only static."Malaysian 370, this is Malaysian 88.""Malaysian 370, this is Malaysian 52."People familiar with the calls, describing them for the first time, said they were calm, even laconic. The pilots trying to reach the airliner had no reason to believe it had suffered anything more than an ordinary radio malfunction. But those initial attempts to find a plane in the skies would soon evolve into an urgent multinational search operation spanning land and sea in two hemispheres. They signaled the start of what has become perhaps the most perplexing case in modern aviation - one that investigators say may take years to solve, or could remain a mystery forever.More than two weeks after Flight 370 disappeared, unbridled speculation surrounds the unfolding global drama. So much is uncertain about what happened on the plane, and so much of what has been disclosed by Malaysian authorities has been contradicted, that hardly any theory of its fate can be easily dismissed. On Saturday, the authorities said a Chinese satellite had made a new sighting of a possible object floating in the southern Indian Ocean in the area that is now the focus of the search, and China was sending ships to investigate.Based on dozens of interviews with people whose lives were touched by the plane as well as with outside experts and investigators from the two dozen countries searching for answers, this report presents a portrait of Flight 370 and the search to find it using what is known to date. But by necessity, it is an incomplete picture.Malaysia Airlines flies from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing twice daily, nonstop. The red-eye, departing at 12:35 a.m. and landing at 6:30 a.m., can carry a hodgepodge of travelers: vacationing Malaysian families, European businessmen pursuing deals, Chinese tourists returning home after visiting relatives or shopping.Passengers are advised to arrive at least two hours in advance. On March 7, a delegation of 34 Chinese artists, relatives and organizers who had spent the past several days participating in an art exhibit in Kuala Lumpur played it safe with the city's unpredictable Friday night traffic and arrived about 8 p.m.Perhaps the most prominent of the artists was the flight's oldest passenger, Liu Rusheng, 77, a calligrapher who had published an essay about how much he treasured life because he had "cheated death" six times, beginning when he was abandoned temporarily by his parents as they fled Japanese soldiers invading China.Liu had "the energy of a young man," recalled Daniel Liau, the delegation's host, who accompanied the travelers to the airport and helped them check their luggage. They stood chatting under the modernist scalloped ceilings of the main terminal for about 90 minutes. Later, after the group had passed through security and taken the monorail to the satellite terminal, Liau called them one last time."How are the artists?" he recalled asking one of the organizers, Hou Bo, who replied they had already reached the gate. "Everybody is OK," Hou assured him.Boarding began about midnight. The airline would have allowed the elderly - including Liu and his wife, Bao Yuanhua, 73 - and the families traveling with the two infants booked on the flight to get settled first. Next came the passengers holding passes for the 35 seats in business class.Philip Wood, 50, an IBM executive from Texas and a regular on the flight because he was relocating from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur, was in coach but hoped to be upgraded. He had long legs and a platinum frequent-flier card, said his partner, Sarah Bajc, 48, a teacher.Bajc said she exchanged a dozen text messages with him before the flight about the movers, scheduled to arrive at their home in Beijing the next morning. "We discussed the state of packing, what still needed to be done," she said. His last message came just before he left for the airport.Others on the flight were just passing through Kuala Lumpur, including Shi Xianwen, 26, a new father returning to China from a business trip to Australia. At the airport in Perth, he spent 40 minutes picking out a bracelet watch for his wife, whose birthday was approaching, an employee at the duty-free shop said.And two passengers boarded using stolen passports: Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, 19, and Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, Iranian men described by Interpol as migrants being smuggled into Europe.Mohammad Mallaeibasir, 18, an information technology student in Kuala Lumpur, said the pair stayed in his apartment the night before they left. Mehrdad, a friend from high school in Tehran, he said, told him he was starting a new life in Hamburg, Germany, where his mother was waiting."He was quite nervous," Mallaeibasir recalled. "I could see it on his face."The next night, he drove them to the airport and offered to help them check in, but they insisted on entering separately, Delavar first. The two high school buddies waited in the car for five to 10 minutes, smoking cigarettes, before Mehrdad got out to leave.Mallaeibasir gave him a hug, told him to have a safe flight and watched as his friend carried a large backpack and a laptop computer bag into the terminal. That was the last he saw of him.The plane the passengers boarded was a Boeing 777, one of the world's most popular and advanced passenger jets, and Boeing's first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, in which electronic controls replaced manual ones. Pilots send commands that are conveyed to the wings and other components, and a computer helps keep the plane steady.The "Triple Seven," as it often called, has all but replaced the 747 because it is cheaper to operate and can fly up to 16 hours without stopping to refuel. It also has one of the industry's best safety records, with only two serious accidents in the 19 years it has been in service.Malaysia Airlines, the nation's state-run carrier, began using the Boeing 777 in 1997 and eventually had 15 in its fleet. One of them, the 404th model to roll off Boeing's assembly line in Everett, Wash., was delivered to the airline in May 2002 and registered with tail number 9M-MRO. This was the plane used for Flight 370 that has disappeared.Malaysia Airlines has said the jet has been involved in only one previous safety incident. On Aug. 9, 2012, the tip of one of its wings broke off after it clipped the tail of a China Eastern Airlines AirbusA340 while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. No one was hurt. Boeing said it sent a team of engineers and mechanics to remove and replace the damaged wing sections, and returned the plane to service after testing.Boeing recommends a light maintenance inspection of the 777 after about 500 hours of flight time. Known as an "A check," the inspection usually is conducted in a hangar by a team of about 15 engineers working about 10 hours, often overnight. Malaysia Airlines said the jet's last "A check" took place Feb. 23, and uncovered no problems.By the time it pulled up to the gate at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8, the plane had completed more than 7,500 flights and clocked over 53,400 hours in the air, according to Flightglobal, a news and data service for the aviation sector. That put it well within the average economic life of 23 years for a wide-body passenger jet.In other words, there was little to distinguish this plane from the roughly 1,170 other Boeing 777s now in use. That is why it is so crucial to determine if the plane's disappearance was due to any malfunction or defect related to its design, build or engineering."The industry does not like uncertainty," said Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. "We will find out what happened."As they stepped on to the plane, the 227 passengers of Flight 370 were greeted by the flight attendants, four women in sarong kebayas and six men in gray three-piece suits. Some distributed hand towels, juice and newspapers in business class; others helped those in economy find their seats.Outside, ground crews loaded the passenger luggage into the jet's cargo hold, which can carry up to six pallets and 14 shipping containers. The airline said no hazardous or valuable goods were on the flight. But among the cargo were a "significant" number of lithium batteries - which can be flammable - more than is typically sent in a shipment, one U.S. official said.After the doors closed, the chief steward, Andrew Nari, would have welcomed the passengers via the loudspeaker and reminded them to turn off their cellphones. Before shutting off his own, he sent a message to his mother. "It was just a normal SMS telling me that his plane would fly off soon," she later told The Star, a local newspaper.In the cockpit were the pilots: the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, who joined the airline in 1981 and had 18,365 hours of flying experience, and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was transitioning to the Boeing 777 from the airline's narrow-body fleet.After nudging away from the gate, the plane taxied to runway 32R. The cabin lights would have dimmed before one of the pilots asked the crew to be seated for takeoff.With two Rolls-Royce Trent engines, each capable of generating more than 92,000 pounds of thrust, the jet raced down the 2.5-mile-long runway and lifted off at 41 minutes after midnight. As the plane banked and climbed, some passengers might have spotted the glow of Kuala Lumpur and perhaps the Petronas Towers in the distance.At 1:07 a.m., as the jet approached the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, ground crews received what the authorities have described as a routine text message from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, which sends regular updates on the condition of the plane by radio or satellite.By then, the first beverage service of the flight was most likely underway - soft drinks, juice and peanuts in economy; in business, various drinks, including Champagne, along with a snack such as charcoal-grilled chicken and lamb satay in peanut sauce. The in-flight entertainment system offered a wide selection of movies.Air traffic control in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, followed the plane by tracking its transponder, a device that "squawks" or emits an identifying signal in response to a signal from radar. The night began with Flight 370 squawking code 2157 and reporting altitude, speed and bearing.As the plane approached Vietnamese airspace, Subang informed the pilots that they were being transferred to radar control in Ho Chi Minh City. At 1:19 a.m., a voice identified by the authorities as that of the first officer, Fariq, replied, "All right, good night."Two minutes later, Flight 370's transponder stopped responding. It is unclear whether someone turned a dial on an instrument panel between the pilot and co-pilot and put the transponder in standby mode, or whether a malfunction caused it to go quiet.One moment, radar scopes showed the plane traveling northwest at 471 knots (542 mph). The next moment, it was gone.The military in Vietnam marked the time at 43 seconds past 1:20 a.m.As air traffic controllers struggled to re-establish contact with Flight 370, military radar at the Butterworth air force base on Malaysia's west coast picked up an unidentified aircraft near where the plane disappeared.But the watch team, normally an officer and three enlisted personnel, either failed to notice the signal or decided not to designate and track it as a "zombie," which would have pushed the information up the chain of command and possibly alerted air command.At a briefing on the base the next night, about 80 air force personnel were told there was "no proof" the unidentified signal showed the missing plane making a sharp turn, flying back across PeninsularMalaysia and then turning again and heading northwest over the Strait of Malacca, a person familiar with the situation said.But investigators now believe that is exactly what happened.The failure to recognize Flight 370 in the radar data - or refusal to do so, to avoid the embarrassment of admitting an unidentified plane had breached air defense - meant the Malaysian authorities continued to search in the seas to the east instead of the west of the peninsula. Military radar last recorded the signal at 2:22 a.m., about 200 nautical miles northwest of Butterworth, according to an image of the radar track.The authorities also failed to move quickly on data that showed the plane continuing to fly nearly seven more hours: a series of regular handshake signals from the plane to a satellite seeking to determine if the aircraft was still in range.Chris McLaughlin, a vice president at Inmarsat, the satellite communications firm, said technicians pulled the logs of all transmissions from the plane within four hours of its disappearance. Then, after a day without sign of the plane, they began scouring the company's databases for any trace of Flight 370."We decided to go have another look at our network to see if there was any data that we had missed," McLaughlin said. It turned out there was. Inmarsat technicians identified what appeared to be a series of fleeting "pings" between Flight 370, a satellite over the Indian Ocean and a ground station in Perth, Australia.The signals - seven of them transmitted at one-hour intervals - were an important clue, because they could have come only from an antenna receiving power from the plane itself. But while they carried a unique code identifying the aircraft as Flight 370, the signals contained no positioning or other data that could indicate where the plane was when it sent them.By Sunday afternoon, a team of Inmarsat engineers set to work using the principles of trigonometry to determine the distance between the satellite and the plane at the time of each ping, and then to calculate two rough flight paths. The plane, they concluded, had turned again. But it may have then traveled in more or less a straight line, heading north over countries likely to have picked it up on radar, or south toward the Indian Ocean and Antarctica.The Malaysian government said it received Inmarsat's data on March 12 and spent three days analyzing and vetting it with investigators from the United States before redirecting the search on March 15.By then, more than a week had passed since the last satellite ping, recorded at 8:11 a.m. on March 8. It appears to have come from over the southern Indian Ocean, halfway around the world from where the plane should have been, on a tarmac in Beijing.###5224||You are using an older browser version.

“At this point, city budget money is not on the table,” he said. “We will collaborate with them to help them find ways to be more efficient and more effective.”

The program was launched last year with a promise from Mayor Michael Bloomberg that it would not require public funding.

But lawsuits, glitches and a lack of use have made Citi Bike’s first year a rough ride — and the program needs a small fortune to stay in business, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Alta Bicycle Share, Citi Bike’s parent company, could generate revenue by raising the annual membership fee of $95, but a City Hall source said that can’t happen until it fixes its operations.

Department of Transportation officials said that rather than raise rates, the program needs to capitalize on all the publicity it got in its first year to win new sponsors as well as private financing.

“If you’re sitting on the story of the year in New York City, you have a lot of opportunities,” a DOT official said.

Brooklyn City Councilman Brad Lander left the door open to public funding.

“Every other form of transportation receives some public subsidy,” Lander said, noting all other cities with bike-share programs subsidize the service.

He said he spoke to DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg about using taxpayer money and she “seemed open to it.”

Asked about this claim, a DOT spokesman referred to the mayor’s earlier statement.

Alta Bicycle Share said it was seeking outside investors.

Manhattan City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, who heads the Transportation Committee, said marketing could expand Citi Bike.

“City dollars should be a last resort only if we are unable to gather interest from new private partnerships,” he said.

He plans to introduce legislation next week that will require Alta to release its financial data.

Trottenberg said she’s confident Citi Bike would resolve its problems and even expand. It has a six-year contract with the city.

EUR/JPY slid to a daily low of 141.03 at 08:24 GMT, after which the pair consolidated at 141.10, losing 0.4% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 140.90, while resistance was to be met at March 13th high, 143.38.

Yen’s demand was supported after it became clear that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that he is ready to sign an accession treaty with Ukraine’s breakaway region of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, regardless of the imposed sanctions by the United States and the European Union.

The yen has advanced 1.1% in the past week amid escalating tension between the West and Russia, being the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. At the same time, the euro was little changed.

Meanwhile, the gauge of economic sentiment for Germany, the largest economy in the euro zone, probably slowed down to a reading of 51.8 in March, according to the median estimate by experts. Last month the index came in at a value of 55.7. The official results from the monthly survey by the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung) are to be announced at 10:00 GMT today.

Yesterday, demand for the 18-nation common currency was pressured after the annualized rate of consumer inflation in the single currency zone was reported to have weakened in February, increasing bets the European Central Bank will have to introduce new measures in order to spur economic growth.

The annualized HICP came in at 0.7% last month, a level last seen during October 2013, which was still far below central bank’s inflation objective of 2%, that provides price stability. Experts had anticipated that the annual inflation rate will remain steady at 0.8% in February.

Elsewhere, EUR/CHF slipped to a daily low at 1.2150 at 7:50 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.2153, down a mere 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 17th low, 1.2133, while resistance was to be encountered at March 13th high, 1.2168.###5227||Gilead Sciences' ( GILD ) shares declined Friday after several House Democrats sent a letter to the company asking for an explanation on the price of its Sovaldi hepatitis C medication.

Because of the drug's $84,000 price tag per treatment, pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts ( ESRX ) is "encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi," according to the March 20 letter. Health officials operating Medicaid programs in Colorado and Pennsylvania also are limiting Sovaldi treatment to only the sickest of patients, they said.

"Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it," wrote Reps.

MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in its native Japan after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around £210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole. It has since taken the same action through the US courts.

Following the debacle, CEO Mark Karpeles's personal blog and Reddit account were hacked, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.

MtGox's opponents have criticised its latest move, describing its bankruptcy protection filing in the US as a "ruse" in an attempt to divert attention from instances of "massive fraud".

MtGox was the world's largest Bitcoin exchange and its recent troubles have seen the virtual currency's value take a dip, with one unit worth around half the price it reached in November 2013.###5229||* Dollar rises against yen and euro before Fed policy decision

* Fed expected to continue tapering its bond-buying stimulus

* Focus on UK jobs data, annual budget (Updates levels, adds comments)

By Anirban Nag

LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen and euro on Wednesday, drawing comfort from expectations the Federal Reserve will further unwind monetary stimulus, looking beyond the impact on the economy of a harsh winter.

Some trepidation before Janet Yellen’s inaugural policy review as Federal Reserve chief will keep gains muted, traders said.

The Fed is widely expected to reduce the size of its monthly bond purchase programme by a further $10 billion at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Yellen, widely regarded as a dove, is due to address a news conference later in the day.

Most are focused on the Fed’s forward guidance on policy. Most expect it to assure investors that rate hikes are a long way off despite the unemployment rate easing faster than expected.

The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 101.625 yen, staying above a one-month low of 101.20 yen hit on March 3. The euro fetched $1.3917, down 0.1 percent on the day but not far from Thursday’s peak of $1.3967 - a 2-1/2-year high.

“The key thing will be whether there will be any change in the timing of rate hikes by the Fed from next year,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.

“I am not convinced the Fed is ready to materially change guidance and we will see a very even-handed Yellen. All of which leaves investors looking to second-quarter U.S. data before taking fresh positions in the dollar.”

The Fed has said it would not raise interest rates until joblessness fell to at least 6.5 percent, a pledge policymakers thought would hold until at least mid-2015. But it hit a five-year low of 6.6 percent in January, before rising to 6.7 percent in February.

Expectations Yellen will pursue a broadly dovish stance have helped rein in U.S. Treasury yields, which in turn has undermined the attraction of the dollar for bond investors.

“Many investors had probably expected the dollar to strengthen this year because the U.S. economy looked in better shape than others,” said Katsunori Kitakura, associate general manager of market making at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.

“But their positioning has probably been damaged by the Ukraine crisis and poor economic data due to bad weather, and that’s probably a reason for the dollar’s struggles recently.”

UK FOCUS

Some of the focus in Europe will be on the British pound. It was up 0.1 percent at $1.6615, with more gains likely if UK jobs data at 0930 GMT shows more signs of robust recovery.

The number of people out of work is expected to have fallen by another 25,000. Wages are expected to have risen 1.2 percent year-on-year - an increase but well below inflation.

“Attention will be on wage growth and that along with a good jobs number could push sterling higher,” said CIBC’s Stretch.

Later, attention will shift to the annual UK budget. Finance minister George Osborne is expected to stick to his tough plan to fix the public finances and this will keep the onus on the Bank of England to keep monetary policy loose to ensure growth.

And while the safe-haven yen lost ground, investors remained cautious over tensions in Ukraine. Anxiety eased somewhat after Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine, a day after Crimean citizens voted to be annexed by Moscow.

PERTH, Australia -- France provided new satellite data Sunday showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

The new information given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia shows "potential objects" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud," Royal Australian Air Force flight Lt. Russell Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.

Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."

Details on the French data were not immediately released. The statement from Malaysia called the information "new satellite images," while a statement from France's Foreign Ministry said "radar echoes taken by a satellite" had located floating debris but made no mention of imagery.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is leading the search in waters off Australia, declined to offer details about the information from France. The authority did not respond to multiple requests by The Associated Press for access to the data.

"Any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans," AMSA said.

But a Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data consisted of radar echoes captured Friday and converted into fuzzy images that located objects about 930 kilometres (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 metres (72 feet) by 13 metres (43 feet), said the official, who declined to be identified because he isn't authorized to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

Information about the new data emerged as authorities co-ordinating the search, which is being conducted about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours. It was spotted Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.

"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue co-ordinationcentre. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.

AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.

"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."

Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of Sunday night.

Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether Flight 370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared, but did not immediately respond to the email.

An official with Malaysia Airlines said Sunday night that the flight was carrying wooden pallets but provided no further details, including the number of pallets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy preventing the official from being named.

When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they first found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

The new 12-sided coin is based on the old threepenny bit and will replace the current coin, which has been in circulation for 30 years. The new £1 coin will be introduced in 2017.

Osborne will reveal in his Budget 2014 speech that a replacement is needed because the pound coin has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

Royal Mint now estimates that about 45 million of £1 coins in circulation are forgeries.

"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," Osborne will say.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

The Treasury will also confirm that while the Queen will remain on one side, the other side's design will be open to public competition.

"The Bank welcomes [the] news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency," said the Bank of England in a press statement.###5233||Airbnb, the room-letting network, is in advanced talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10bn (£6bn).

The company, which allows people to list spaces to rent including tree-houses, castles or even an astronomic geodesic dome , has previously outlined its aim to become the world’s largest hotelier this year.

Private equity group TPG is likely to lead the fundraising valuation, which could total between $400m and $500m, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Its fundraising valuation will see it overtake Intercontinental Hotel Group’s market value of £4.8bn.

The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, a computer science graduate.

Struggling to pay rent, the trio came up with the idea of renting out three airbeds on their living room floor during a San Francisco design conference which saw most of the city’s hotels being fully booked. The next day they created a website airbedandbreakfast.com, which later became Airbnb.

Over 11 million guests have stayed on Airbnb to date, and Airbnb now lists over 600,000 properties in over 35,000 cities worldwide.

Earlier this week the company reported that over one million guests from the UK have now used the service with Paris, New York, Barcelona and Amsterdam being the most popular destinations.

Mr Blecharczyk told The Sunday Telegraph in November: “InterContinental and Hilton have more than 650,000 rooms. We have 500,000, though they have a much higher occupancy rate.”

Asked if he expects Airbnb to overtake the two groups next year, he replied “yes”.

“If you look at our historical growth curve, I don’t think that’s going to change very quickly,” he added. “We’ve been growing bookings and revenues two to three times every year and I would expect that to continue

The company, which counts Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher as an investor, last raised $2.5bn in 2012 from venture capital investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.

The fundraising attempts come despite an Airbnb horror story going viral after a host wrote a public letter to the company alleging his home was used for a weekend orgy and he was facing eviction from his landlord.

Starting on March 26, Walmart starts taking on GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, and a number of other retailers with a video game trade-in program, the company confirms. You’ll be able to sell off your old games at any of the more than 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a gift card for use online or in-store at any Walmart or Sam’s Club. This also means that Walmart’s getting into the used game sales business, with all re-sold discs sent off to be refurbished before being restocked on store shelves (or kept as inventory for online sales) at a lower price.

The program works just like others of this sort. You bring your game in its original packaging to the electronics department of one of the company’s stores. A customer service rep will inspect each disc for cracks and other defects and tells you what it’s all worth. Then you get your money, in the form of a gift card. Simple stuff.

The program builds on Walmart’s existing trade-in program, that allows customers to sell off old smartphones and tablets.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade in their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores.

Starting next week, customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam”s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

The world”s largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market. It”s a business that”s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world”s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart”s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers for in return for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games. The latter was an apparent reference to GameStop”s program.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They”ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think the move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn”t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

And Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pointed out that GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it”s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers” grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer”s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###5242||New model: The new one pound coin (Picture: HM Treasury/PA)

However, Kelvin Reynolds, from the British Parking Association, welcomed the move.

‘Parking operators have long expressed concerns about a rise in counterfeit £1 coins and the inconvenience this causes to motorists when coins are rejected by parking machines,’ he said.###5243||(Updated to reflect comment from Glassdoor)

It's hard to be the king... err, I mean CEO.

Even if your company has a pretty spectacular year, where you finally figure out how to monetize, and the investing world rewards you handsomely for it, and then you cap it off with an historic purchase, your employees still might knock you off the top spot of beloved CEOs.

Poor Mark Zuckerberg. Last year he held the top spot on Glassdoor's list of the top 50 highest rated CEOs. Now the 2014 list was released out on Friday, and Zuck is no longer on top. He's not in the top five either. In fact, he's barely even in the top 10, falling all the way down to number nine.

His replacement as top CEO is LinkedIn's Jeff Weiner, the only one on the list to get a perfect 100% rating. (I have this vision in my head of Weiner coming up to Zuckerberg and saying, "Look at me. Look at me! I'm the captain now!" I'd give anything for that to actually happen!)

Funny enough, Weiner did not even have enough reviews to even qualify last year because he did not have enough ratings to qualifty.

These rankings are based purely on employee feedback, which was submitted from between February 1st, 2013 and January 31st 2014. At least 100 current and former employees need to have filled out surveys, hence why someone as beloved as Weiner may not make the list one year, and then top it the next.

With Weiner at number one, and Zuckerberg at number nine, who else from the tech world made the list?

Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm came in at number four, with a 95% approval rating. Last year he was down at number 8, with the same percentage. Apparently the list got a lot tougher in 2013!

Another top 10 CEO was Brad Smith of Intuit, making a big surge from number 23 on last year's list. Meanwhile, Google's Larry Page came in right behind Zuckerberg at number 10, moving up one spot from 2013.

Marc Benioff of Salesforce was given a 93% approval rating, good enough for number 12. He also moved up one spot from last year. Apple's Tim Cook went from number 18 to 17, while eBay's John Donahoe did not even make the list last year and found himself as the 19th most beloved CEO of 2013.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw a big tumble, going from 18th place, and a 93% approval rating in 2012, to 32nd place, and only 86% approval, for last year. I guess his employees hate the idea of drone delivery as much as the rest of us!

And finally, just squeaking by is Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, who only 79% of her employees like. Ouch! Sadly, Mayer is only one of two women, along with Victoria’s Secret CEO Sharen Turney, to be ranked. Last year only Turney made the list, so at least that's some progress, right? Right?

Some who made it onto last year's list, only to find themselves kicked off, are Dell CEO Michael S. Dell, Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata Consultansy Services and Krishnakumar Natarajan of Mindtree.

This is the fifth time that Glassdoor has put out the top CEO list, but there was a change made this year:the company has added a second list made up of f the top 25 CEOs leading small & mid-sized companies, meaning fewer than 1,000 employees.

Topping that list was Robert Reid of Intacct Corporation, followed by Anthony Bruce of Applied Predictive Technologies, Steve Beauchamp of Paylocity, Bill Davison of SirsiDynix and Chip Paucek of 2U.

“We find on Glassdoor that a strong leader is often one who has the ability to clearly communicate the vision for the company and who helps employees see how their work connects to the big picture. In addition, top rated CEOs are commonly seen as relatable, accessible and transparent,” Robert Hohman, Glassdoor CEO and co-founder, said in a statement to VatorNews.

“I offer my sincerest congratulations to all CEOs recognized on the 2014 Glassdoor report. It is no small feat to gain the support of your employees for your leadership.”

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.###5245||Empty###5246||Janet Yellen answers a question at a news conference following the March 2014 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, while at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington. Reuters

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it could keep interest rates unusually low even after the US job market returns to full strength and inflation rises to the central bank's target.

In announcing its view on future rates after a two-day policy meeting, it also dropped a set of guideposts it was using to help the public anticipate when it would finally start bumping overnight borrowing costs up from zero.

It said, however, that dropping a promise to hold rates steady "well past the time" the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent did not indicate any change in its policy intentions. Rather than relying on unemployment and inflation thresholds to guide expectations, it said would lean on a wide range of economic indicators in making its decision.

But what stood out in the central bank's statement was its embrace of easy money policies even after the Fed achieves its goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation.

"Economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run," the Fed's policy panel said after its first meeting chaired by Janet Yellen.

Yellen, who took the helm of the central bank on Feb. 1, is set to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).

U.S. stock prices fell after the statement was released, while yields on U.S. government debt rose.

The central bank also proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota dissented, saying that dropping the threshold could hurt the credibility of the Fed's commitment to return inflation to 2 percent.

MEASURE WIND DOWN

The decision to continue to scale back its stimulus keeps the Fed on track for the measured wind down laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke. The Fed repeated that it plans to continue trimming the asset purchases in "measured steps" as long as labor conditions continue to improve and inflation shows signs of rising back toward the Fed's 2-percent goal.

The Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.

The Fed had said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.

But the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs.

Of the Fed's 16 policymakers, only one believes it will be appropriate to raise rates this year; 13 expect a first rate hike next year, and 2 others see the first rate hike coming in 2016, according to fresh forecasts published on Wednesday. But once rate hikes start, Fed officials see slightly sharper increases than they did in December, with rates ending 2015 at 1 percent and ending 2016 at 2.25 percent, according to the median of forecasts.

In December, Fed officials expected short-term rates to be just 1.75 percent by the end of 2016.

The new forecasts also show Fed officials see unemployment dropping slightly faster, to between 5.6 percent and 5.9 percent by the end of 2015. In December their forecasts called for unemployment falling to between 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015.

KEEPING MARKETS IN LINE

The Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring.

It began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10 billion.

At the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But as the actual jobless rate neared the threshold, officials began to seek a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy.

They want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts. If traders start to price in earlier rate hikes, the result would be tighter financial conditions that could deter the very investment and hiring that the Fed wants to promote.

Many Fed officials, including Yellen, have said recent weakness in economic data, from jobs and retail sales to industrial production and home building, appears largely due to the unusually harsh winter and should soon dissipate.

US Fed revamps rates guidance, trims bond buys further

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy's strength, and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.

KEY POINTS:

* Fed dropping its promise to hold rates steady "well past the time" the U.S. unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent doesn't indicate any change in the Fed's policy intentions.

* Fed cuts monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

* Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.

COMMENTS: MARGARET KERINS, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME STRATEGY, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, CHICAGO:

"Her speech was extremely dovish, but we believed going in to the Fed meeting today the market was priced to the perfect dove. There was a slight change in the summary of economic projections, the jobs were slightly more hawkish and the rapid improvement in the labor market was reflected in those projections by the Fed themselves, even though they're adding in quite a grouping of labor market indicators that they're watching.

"They're going to have to focus on that lack of growth potential going forward, and introducing that today. But clearly the market is reading it as hawkish. We don't think that the Fed given where we are in the economic cycle and in terms of the recovery, and our expectation that the economy will take off following this somewhat weather-related downturn that it's very, very hard to be credible about keeping rates really, really low."

BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:

"I think the (stock) market initially reacted negatively to the Fed's statement because the forward guidance is mildly hawkish. Yellen is no dove. She's a pragmatist. The new forward guidance axes the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and replaces it with inflation expectations. The interesting twist here is that the Fed is fine with a zero federal funds rate provided the Fed projects inflation to still be below its target of 2 percent. It used to be that the Fed would tolerate projected inflation running a half percent hotter than that. Also, it's not just about the Fed's projections, but the public's expectations of inflation. The Fed wants to keep inflation expectations anchored and those expectations can be fickle."

SCOTT CLEMONS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN PRIVATE BANKING, NEW YORK:

"It strikes me as a pretty dovish statement, but what surprised me is the word choice. Right now the unemployment rate remains elevated. I think that the Fed is far more focused on that than they are on their other mandate, inflation."

"The bigger picture here, to me this sends a very strong signal that the Yellen Fed is a continuation of the Bernanke Fed in one very important aspect. Whereas the Fed is often thought of as having two policy tools, balance sheet operations and interest rates, under Bernanke and Yellen they have made communication a very potent third tool as well. They're going to communicate, communicate, communicate so that when the fed funds rate begins to move higher, hopefully the collective economy shrugs its shoulders and says, 'Yeah, we knew that was coming.'"

JIM KOCHAN, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:

"The committee has updated its forward guidance, I wish they would tell us what that updated forward guidance is. We can assume their forward guidance is that they will be looking at broader measures of labor market activity to see when it's appropriate to raise interest rates, and 6.5 percent doesn't have much meaning anymore. If there are going to be any surprises it's going to be with the press conference. I think it was very much as expected."

DAVID MOLAR, PARTNER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR AT HIGHTOWER, SAN DIEGO:

"The Fed moved the goal post again. It goes from a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold to a qualitative approach which is nebulous for the market. No one knows what will trigger further tapering, a pause in tapering or an increase in asset purchase. It's a major change in policy. This Fed seems to be making it up as it goes along. The markets are spiking on this even though analysts have been expecting this along. Gold has sold off and you are seeing pressure on bonds and rate-sensitive sectors."

MARK GRANT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SOUTHWEST SECURITIES, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA: "What seems to be troubling the market is that even though it reiterated that it wouldn't be raising rates this year, people were put on notice that a hike is coming. We'll likely see some rise in short rates as a result of this, if not out across the whole curve." SHAUN OSBORNE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: "It's a little bit more hawkish than people expected. They seem to see interest rates rising sooner rather than later. People had been expecting something slightly more dovish given the effects on economic activity from the harsh winter. This is helping the dollar." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO, LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "I think everybody expected a $10 billion cut in the rate of QE3 purchases to $55 billion, so there's no surprise there. "There was a high degree of speculation in terms of changing the Fed language, so there was some clarity on that point. "Probably the biggest takeaway was the Fed saying they would possibly consider maintaining monetary policy or interest rates lower than what they would normally be even when the Fed guideline targets of unemployment and inflation were hit. So the question becomes whether that would in fact create some inflation pressure." THOMAS DI GALOMA, CO-HEAD FIXED INCOME RATES, ED&F MAN CAPITAL, NEW YORK "This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets -- the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015."

WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, ROCKWELL SECURITIES, NEW YORK "So far this is just what the market wanted-the Fed staying accommodative. It doesn't look like too much has changed, although dropping the 6.5 percent unemployment rate might be a key issue. Yields are jumping up right now, which might be a sign that people think Yellen will tighten sooner rather than later, or that inflation could come into the market if the Fed keeps rates low well past 6.5 percent."

BRUCE McCAIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, KEY PRIVATE BANK, CLEVELAND, OHIO "At this point, there are relatively few surprises. I think in some sense, as the Fed tapers it becomes less important for the market. What becomes more important from here is whether the economy can recover its momentum once the weather issue thaws. One of the headlines I saw was that a majority of members do expect a rate hike. I think that's a little disappointing for investors. In addition, if we replace the 6.5 percent rate with a variety of indicators, that makes Fed actions less predictable, which adds to the market uncertainty." PAUL MANGUS, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH AND STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO PRIVATE BANK, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA "The one difference I could see early on was a little bit more information on when and by how much the Fed may increase rates in 2015, which is a long way off yet. Other than that, we expected to hear more about a wider range of economic indicators beyond the unemployment rate and that was in the release, so that was not a surprise. The economic information that was supplied was also pretty much as expected, mentions of weaker labor markets earlier in the year due to weather conditions but showing signs of improving. Other areas of the economy are continuing to show signs of gradual improvement, but the Fed was looking for a much stronger economic background before it would start any type of tightening efforts, so it would continue to support liquidity in the marketplace."

Opened Rossiya Bank account - earmarked for sanctions by U.S.

Putin's £4,500 monthly salary will now be paid into the bank

Chechnya President Ramzan Kadyrov also opened an account there



Ukrainian PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk hit out at Putin the 'armed gangster'



Vladimir Putin yesterday mocked the West's sanctions against Russia - as eastern Europe began boosting its defences amid fears of further Kremlin land grabs.



Putin dismissively brushed aside concerns raised by Washington, Brussels and London and inked Crimea's switch to rule by Moscow in defiance of international objections.



He also laughed off punishments imposed by the U.S. and EU on his closest friends and their banks.



Putin opened an account in blacklisted St Petersburg-based Rossiya Bank, which was singled out for sanctions by America, and ordered that his monthly £4,500 salary be paid into the bank.



'I have ordered the administrative department to transfer my salary there,' he said.

Vladamir Putin today said he would be transferring his salary to Russian Bank Rossiya Bank - despite the fact that the U.S. has said that it plans to sanction the organisation

The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, joined him. 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it,' he said.



And Putin joked in abusive slang that a gaggle of oligarchs including Yuriy Kovalchuk and Gennadiy Timchenko - seen by the U.S. as his 'cronies' and subjected to sanctions in support of Kiev - are 'typical moskali', bearing Ukrainian names.



But the Ukrainian premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday said he was signing an EU association deal - the first step to membership - to protect his country from 'armed gangster' Putin.



He insisted 'Russia has undermined the global security system.



'Russia has started to behave like an armed gangster in Europe, therefore we should find an adequate answer to stop an international crime because this is an international crime.'



In slashing a gas subsidy to Ukraine, he was using 'energy as a new nuclear weapon,' he said.

Poland responded by announcing that it will speed up the £3 billion purchase of a missile defence system, with Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz calling the turmoil in neighbouring Ukraine the 'biggest crisis' since escaping the Soviet noose 25 years ago.



President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov (right) also transferred his money to the sactioned bank. He said: 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it'

France yesterday offered to send four fighter jets to the Baltic states and to ensure twice weekly AWACS patrols.



Yesterday 32 Crimean Tatars has requested refugee status in Poland following Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula.



Meanwhile, Ukraine was plunged into a corruption crisis amid claims that officials in the new government maybe complicit in an alleged £2.5 billion embezzlement scandal involving the Naftogaz state oil and gas company.



Naftogaz chief Yevgen Bakulin is suspected of heading a 'criminal group' whose members include other senior current and former Ukrainian government members.



Bakulin was detained last night after the corruption claims by Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.###5248||Talk to a domain expert: 1-303-893-0552

EUR/JPY slid to a daily low of 141.03 at 08:24 GMT, after which the pair consolidated at 141.10, losing 0.4% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 140.90, while resistance was to be met at March 13th high, 143.38.

Yen’s demand was supported after it became clear that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that he is ready to sign an accession treaty with Ukraine’s breakaway region of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, regardless of the imposed sanctions by the United States and the European Union.

The yen has advanced 1.1% in the past week amid escalating tension between the West and Russia, being the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. At the same time, the euro was little changed.

Meanwhile, the gauge of economic sentiment for Germany, the largest economy in the euro zone, probably slowed down to a reading of 51.8 in March, according to the median estimate by experts. Last month the index came in at a value of 55.7. The official results from the monthly survey by the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung) are to be announced at 10:00 GMT today.

Yesterday, demand for the 18-nation common currency was pressured after the annualized rate of consumer inflation in the single currency zone was reported to have weakened in February, increasing bets the European Central Bank will have to introduce new measures in order to spur economic growth.

The annualized HICP came in at 0.7% last month, a level last seen during October 2013, which was still far below central bank’s inflation objective of 2%, that provides price stability. Experts had anticipated that the annual inflation rate will remain steady at 0.8% in February.

Elsewhere, EUR/CHF slipped to a daily low at 1.2150 at 7:50 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.2153, down a mere 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 17th low, 1.2133, while resistance was to be encountered at March 13th high, 1.2168.###5251||The £1 coin is to be replaced by a new model based on the old threepenny bit, George Osborne will announce in the Budget.

The Chancellor will say that the current coin, which has been in circulation for 30 years, is no longer suitable for use because it has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

The new 12-sided coin will be as secure as modern banknotes and will save taxpayers’ money by cutting down on millions of pounds worth of fraud.

“After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” the Chancellor is expected to tell MPs.

The Royal Mint estimates that about 45m £1 coins in circulation are now forgeries.

The Government expects the new coin to be introduced in 2017.

As with all British coins, the Queen’s effigy will be on the “heads side”. However, there will now be a public competition to decide the design for the “tails” side of the coin.

The Treasury said: “With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

“We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

A source said that the new coin, which will be roughly the same size as the current £1, will still fit in supermarket trolleys, parking meters and vending machines.

The threepenny bit was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. It replaced the old silver threepence, known as a "Joey".

It was particularly popular during the Second World War, when its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during blackouts.

By the time of decimalisation 1.2bn of the coins had been issued for circulation.

A Bank of England spokesman said: “The Bank welcomes [the] news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”

Kelvin Reynolds, director of policy and public affairs at the British Parking Association, said: “Parking operators have long expressed concerns about a rise in counterfeit £1 coins and the inconvenience this causes to motorists when coins are rejected by parking payment machines and the losses incurred as a result.”

According to the survey of households, the unemployment rate decreased one-tenth of 1 percentage point to 6.1 percent. The number of people actively participating in the labor force increased 5,900 to 2,754,600 and total employment increased 8,000 to 2,586,100, causing the number of unemployed to decline 2,000.

The national unemployment rate decreased one-tenth of 1 percentage point over the same period to 6.6 percent.

Over the year, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased from 34.3 to 34.2 hours and average hourly earnings increased from $25.11 to $26.11.

The largest over-the-month private sector job gains were in leisure and hospitality, construction and education and health services. Other services declined by 1,100 jobs.

Over the year, nonfarm payroll jobs increased 63,200 with an increase of 59,400 in the private sector and an increase of 3,800 in government. The largest private sector job gains were in professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and education and health services. There were no significant over-the-year losses.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down one and one-tenth of 1 percent from 7.2 percent in January 2013. The number of Coloradans participating in the labor force decreased 2,000, total employment increased 28,300 and the number of unemployed decreased 30,300. The national unemployment rate declined from 7.9 to 6.6 percent from January 2013 to January this year.

In 2013 the Colorado labor force peaked at 2,758,400 in April, which is also a series peak, and declined steadily through December to 2,749,600, down 8,800. The labor force increased in January by 5,900 returning to within 2,900 of the 2013 peak.

Total employment, which reached a series peak of 2,611,300 in March 2008, climbed to an annual peak of 2,578,100 in December 2013. Total employment increased 8,000 from December to January to 2,586,100, which is 25,200 below the series peak.

The number of unemployed Coloradans reached a series peak of 246,700 in October 2010. The number of unemployed has declined steadily over 2013 to reach 170,600 in December 2013. In January the number of unemployed declined further by 2,000 to 168,500. (The numbers do not add due to rounding.) The last time the number of unemployed was at this level or lower was December 2008 when there were an estimated 167,500 unemployed.

The Colorado unemployment rate peaked at 9.1 percent in October 2010 and has declined almost without interruption since. The last time the unemployment rate was as low as 6.1 percent was December 2008. The 2013 annual average Colorado unemployment rate remains unchanged by the annual revision process and is 6.8 percent.

Colorado labor force participation reached a series peak of 74.4 percent in July 1998. Though labor force participation has alternately declined and increased as work attitudes have been affected by the business cycle, labor force participation is expected to continue to decline with the rate of decline accelerating as baby boomers continue to age out of the workforce.

Revised figures show Colorado lost 151,400 payroll jobs from a peak of 2,362,700 reached May 2008 to a trough of 2,211,300 reached January 2010. Revisions also indicate full recovery occurred in April 2013 when Colorado total nonfarm payroll jobs exceeded the May 2008 peak and reached a level of 2,367,300. Another milestone occurred when Colorado payroll jobs exceeded 2.4 million in October 2013 reaching 2,400,900, up from 2,397,100 in September 2013.

The annual growth rate of Colorado nonfarm payroll jobs was 3.0 percent in 2013 revised up from 2.4 percent. The U.S. annual payroll jobs growth rate in 2013 was 1.7 percent.###5253||Empty###5254||Empty###5255||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

The French images show more objects in the southern corridor, a huge stretch of ocean towards Antarctica. This covers the path the plane could have taken if it headed south but it is not known how close to the other sightings – by Australia and Chine – the latest objects are. The Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement today: "This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor. "Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

This is the third promising discovery as the international search enters its third week. Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein was yesterday given a hand written note in the middle of his daily press briefing. China spotted the 74ft by 42ft piece of debris via satellite images. It was 75 miles south west of an earlier sighting by Australia. Six aircraft had already covered 13,900 square miles of ocean south west of Perth in Australia in the hunt for the plane. Investigators are also looking into claims that the captain of the missing flight, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, received a two-minute long call from a mystery woman shortly before take-off. Suspicions have been raised because the call was made from a Pay as You Go SIM card obtained recently under a false identity.

There are fears that the discovery backs up claims Captain Zaharie, 53, had possible links to terror groups, who frequently use untraceable SIM cards to avoid detection. It has been claimed he is a supporter of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was jailed for five years in a controversial court hearing which took place just hours before the missing flight departed. The Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur at 12.40am on March 8 and went missing half an hour into the fight to Beijing. It disappeared off military radar altogether at 2.15am. Authorities also face a race against time to locate the plane's black box voice and data recorder, which transmits an electronic signal for just 30 days before running out of battery. The family of the 239 people on the aircraft are frustrated with the lack of information they are receiving.###5257||Empty###5258||

Rob Griffith And Scott McDonald, The Associated Press





PERTH, Australia -- France provided new satellite data Sunday showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

The new information given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia shows "potential objects" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud," Royal Australian Air Force flight Lt. Russell Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.

Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."

Details on the French data were not immediately released. The statement from Malaysia called the information "new satellite images," while a statement from France's Foreign Ministry said "radar echoes taken by a satellite" had located floating debris but made no mention of imagery.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is leading the search in waters off Australia, declined to offer details about the information from France. The authority did not respond to multiple requests by The Associated Press for access to the data.

"Any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans," AMSA said.

But a Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data consisted of radar echoes captured Friday and converted into fuzzy images that located objects about 930 kilometres (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 metres (72 feet) by 13 metres (43 feet), said the official, who declined to be identified because he isn't authorized to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

Information about the new data emerged as authorities co-ordinating the search, which is being conducted about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours. It was spotted Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.

"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue co-ordinationcentre. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.

AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.

"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."

Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of Sunday night.

Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether Flight 370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared, but did not immediately respond to the email.

An official with Malaysia Airlines said Sunday night that the flight was carrying wooden pallets but provided no further details, including the number of pallets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy preventing the official from being named.

When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they first found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

The national unemployment rate decreased one-tenth of 1 percentage point over the same period to 6.6 percent.

Over the year, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased from 34.3 to 34.2 hours and average hourly earnings increased from $25.11 to $26.11.

The largest over-the-month private sector job gains were in leisure and hospitality, construction and education and health services. Other services declined by 1,100 jobs.

Over the year, nonfarm payroll jobs increased 63,200 with an increase of 59,400 in the private sector and an increase of 3,800 in government. The largest private sector job gains were in professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and education and health services. There were no significant over-the-year losses.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down one and one-tenth of 1 percent from 7.2 percent in January 2013. The number of Coloradans participating in the labor force decreased 2,000, total employment increased 28,300 and the number of unemployed decreased 30,300. The national unemployment rate declined from 7.9 to 6.6 percent from January 2013 to January this year.

In 2013 the Colorado labor force peaked at 2,758,400 in April, which is also a series peak, and declined steadily through December to 2,749,600, down 8,800. The labor force increased in January by 5,900 returning to within 2,900 of the 2013 peak.

Total employment, which reached a series peak of 2,611,300 in March 2008, climbed to an annual peak of 2,578,100 in December 2013. Total employment increased 8,000 from December to January to 2,586,100, which is 25,200 below the series peak.

The number of unemployed Coloradans reached a series peak of 246,700 in October 2010. The number of unemployed has declined steadily over 2013 to reach 170,600 in December 2013. In January the number of unemployed declined further by 2,000 to 168,500. (The numbers do not add due to rounding.) The last time the number of unemployed was at this level or lower was December 2008 when there were an estimated 167,500 unemployed.

The Colorado unemployment rate peaked at 9.1 percent in October 2010 and has declined almost without interruption since. The last time the unemployment rate was as low as 6.1 percent was December 2008. The 2013 annual average Colorado unemployment rate remains unchanged by the annual revision process and is 6.8 percent.

Colorado labor force participation reached a series peak of 74.4 percent in July 1998. Though labor force participation has alternately declined and increased as work attitudes have been affected by the business cycle, labor force participation is expected to continue to decline with the rate of decline accelerating as baby boomers continue to age out of the workforce.

Revised figures show Colorado lost 151,400 payroll jobs from a peak of 2,362,700 reached May 2008 to a trough of 2,211,300 reached January 2010. Revisions also indicate full recovery occurred in April 2013 when Colorado total nonfarm payroll jobs exceeded the May 2008 peak and reached a level of 2,367,300. Another milestone occurred when Colorado payroll jobs exceeded 2.4 million in October 2013 reaching 2,400,900, up from 2,397,100 in September 2013.

The annual growth rate of Colorado nonfarm payroll jobs was 3.0 percent in 2013 revised up from 2.4 percent. The U.S. annual payroll jobs growth rate in 2013 was 1.7 percent.###5260||Exclusive Free E-Book

The proposal ties compensation for chief executive John Martin to wider access to the drug maker’s popular roster of HIV and hepatitis C treatments.

The shareholder resolution from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has previously lambasted Gilead and other drug makers over their pricing, was proposed in response to the recently approved Sovaldi pill for hepatitis C. Gilead priced its medicine at $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, which works out to $1,000 a day. As a result, AHF maintains that Sovaldi will be unaffordable for some patients.

Such concerns, in fact, prompted the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee to ask Gilead to explain the rationale behind its pricing. In a letter sent yesterday to the drug maker, the lawmakers worry that Sovaldi pricing may be too high for patients with public or private insurance. A report released last week by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that is supported, in part, by insurers, forecast that Sovaldi may negatively burden health-care budgets.

Under the new law, edible marijuana products sold to medical marijuana patients must be in opaque, child-proof packaging. The law also allows marijuana businesses to confiscate fake IDs from minors, just as liquor stores do, and requires that marijuana grown in a home with minors must be enclosed and locked.

Advocates of the law, which included the marijuana industry, say it is an important clarification that will help keep legal marijuana from getting into the hands of minors. "Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Governor Hickenlooper, before signing the bill.

But there is still disagreement about whether the regulations go far enough. In particular, the popular niche of marijuana "edibles" – candy, cookies, gummy bears, lollipops – has been controversial, since skeptics say it can be too easy for someone to confuse the products with their non-pot-infused counterparts, or to ingest higher quantities of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, than they intend. There have also been concerns about the accuracy of testing and labeling, particularly when it comes to the potency of such products.

The new packaging requirements "are a step in the right direction," says Rachel O'Bryan, an attorney and member of Smart Colorado, a group pushing for tighter regulation. "But the underlying product in the packaging can still be confused with real food. The second you take it out of that packaging, you don't know if the product is a gummy bear or a" marijuana-infused product.

Ms. O'Bryan cites the incident in a Westminster, Colo., middle school last week in which a student brought marijuana candies to school and shared them with friends, some of whom said they didn't know the candy contained marijuana. In another incident, reported in Steamboat Springs last week, an 18-year-old man cleaning a condo apparently ate a candy bar left behind by the renters without realizing it was infused with marijuana. He went to the hospital and was treated for an overdose.

In the middle school incident, at least 15 students were involved, according to police and three have been arrested. Several more are facing suspensions. But O'Bryan says that she would prefer to see punishment of the adults – who presumably purchased the candy and made it accessible – than the students.

"We would like to see both messaging to Colorado parents, as well as strict enforcement of laws that when an adult gives marijuana to a child they are going to be held accountable," she says.

Her group would also like to see tighter regulations on the amount of marijuana concentrates that can be sold. Buying an ounce of pure THC, as is currently allowed, says O'Bryan, can be the equivalent of roughly 2,800 servings and yet could fit into a shampoo bottle. "That's concerning to us when the No. 1 [federal] priority is keeping it out of hands of minors."

Such concerns have some validity, says Michael Elliott, executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, but in most cases he doesn't think new laws are necessary. The packaging law was an appropriate way to close a loophole, Mr. Elliott says, but the Department of Revenue can look into limits on concentrates and can set rules.

"We have a very good process in place, and the Department of Revenue is doing a tremendous job in a very difficult environment," says Elliott.

Concerns have been raised, too, about the accuracy of testing and the ability of labs to handle the state's needs. Starting May 1, all edibles that are sold from a recreational pot business must have been tested for potency. And by Oct. 1, all marijuana products will need to be tested both for potency and contaminants.

The Denver Post has raised questions about the accuracy of some of the testing. And Elliott says there are concerns about whether there will be enough labs to meet the demand. Currently there are three licensed facilities, and three more on the way.

"It’s a huge testing burden," says Elliott.

Since recreational sales became legal in Colorado on Jan. 1, the state has been under tremendous scrutiny. But while there have been some anecdotal incidents of increased emergency room visits and minors accessing pot, there isn't much data.

Elliott says that the lack of incidents should be viewed as a success.

"All the public safety nightmares people said were going to happen, none of them materialized," Elliott says, noting that both traffic fatalities and teen marijuana use both went down in the past few years. Unlike the black-market system through which marijuana is readily available in the rest of the world, he adds, "we now have a system of accountability and transparency."

The biggest safety concern that Elliott and marijuana industry members still have, he says, is that marijuana businesses, no matter how big, can't use banks. They are forced to deal almost exclusively in cash – a situation that could make them attractive targets for criminals.

Critics of legalization say it's far too soon to count Colorado as a success.

Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), a national group that opposes legalization, has started a new website, legalizationviolations.org, that tracks some kinds of incidents in Colorado and Washington State, which has also legalized recreational marijuana. Recent posts speak of Colorado pot crossing into Nebraska and Wyoming and teenagers using vaporizers – a sort of e-cigarette – to discreetly smoke pot in class, since there's no smell or smoke.

"Any steps to reduce access to kids and make it less likely kids will use marijuana is laudable, but I think will ultimately be unsuccessful in the framework of legalization," says Kevin Sabet, the cofounder of Project SAM and director of the Drug Policy Institute at the University of Florida. "Because legalization by definition is the commercialization of marijuana and companies only make money off heavy users, they have to target young people as part of a successful business model."###5269||After banning Twitter last night, the actions of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan have failed spectacularly.

Immediately following Turkey’s ban, Twitter issued an SMS workaround. Then, “#TwitterisblockedinTurkey” became a globally trending topic on Twitter. Into the night, usage of Google’s free DNS service exploded to circumvent the blockage of Twitter’s domain. Now, social media analysis firms Brandwatch and We Are Social report that Turkish tweets last night and this morning are up by a massive 138 percent.

The following graph, provided by Brandwatch, shows the rise in tweets from 2 A.M. to 12 P.M. (Turkish CET).

Turkish users collectively tweeted 2.5 million times since the ban went into effect, potentially “setting new records for Twitter use in the country,” according to a different study reported by the Guardian.

Fanning the flames, usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) in Turkey appears to be up significantly. ZenMate, for example — a security and privacy extension for Google Chrome — reports it saw “25,000 visitors from Turkey to the Chrome store in the last 12 hours.” Similarly, VPN provider Hotspot Shield saw an uptick in usage on iOS, and is now the top Android app in the Google Play store in Turkey.

Studies such as the above serve only as rough guidelines and are limited by sample size. Collectively, however, the reports make for strong evidence that Erdogan has failed to enact an effective country-wide ban on Twitter.

The financing will bring in several hundred million dollars, though the final amount hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal remains in flux. The San Francisco-based company, backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was valued at US$2.5 billion in 2012.

At US$10 billion, Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, which includes Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It would also be worth more than twice as much as publicly traded vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc.

A slew of technology startups have lately raised huge rounds of financing at increasing valuations, as corporate investors, hedge funds and mutual funds seek stakes in companies before they go public. Messaging application TangoMe Inc. today raised US$280 million from investors led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in a deal that values the startup at more than US$1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this week, Cloudera Inc. said it raised US$160 million, with more set to come from investors including Intel Corp., people with knowledge of the situation said.

Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb lets users rent out a couch, bedroom or house and makes money by charging a fee for each transaction. The company has listings in more than 34,000 cities, according to its website.

Mannheim-based think tank ZEW's monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

It was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

“The Crimea Crisis is weighing on expert's economic expectations for Germany,” said ZEW president Clemens Fuest.

“Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

The United States and European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.

The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0 yet still underscoring the strength of the German economy.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said the combination of emerging market turbulence earlier this year and the stand-off between Russia and the West may have a “mildly dampening impact on Germany's investment climate” and therefore on growth.

But he noted that “it would take a much more serious crisis in Ukraine to derail the recovery in Germany and the euro zone as a whole”.

The German economy, a growth locomotive in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8 percent this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.

Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January.

Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.

The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said. - Reuters###5274||It's not just Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime loyalty shopping program that is getting more expensive. Pandora (NYSE:P) revealed last night that its premium Pandora One offering will also soon set music buffs back a little more.

Existing monthly Internet radio subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 a month -- for now -- but new subscribers will have to shell out $4.99 a month starting in May. This doesn't mean that existing premium members won't pay more. The annual Pandora One plan that costs $36 -- or $3 a month -- is being discontinued. Users will migrate to the $3.99-a-month plan.

Pandora said the increases are necessary. It hasn't tweaked its prices since 2009, yet in that time the royalty rates that it pays to artists through SoundExchange have soared 53%. It's a similar rationale that Amazon used with its $20 Prime fee increase, arguing that shipping costs alone have escalated in the nine years that it stuck to the $79-a-year pricing.

However, some may wonder if Pandora is picking the wrong time to push through an increase. Amazon doesn't really have any material competition when it comes to e-commerce, but Pandora is starting to feel the pinch from the competition. Listener hours in February rose just 9% since last year's showing. This is the first time that year-over-year growth at Pandora has slumped into the single digits. It's a far cry from the 101% and 42% growth spurts that Pandora had posted in prior February installments.

Growth is still growth, but Pandora's monthly metrics have showed sequential spottiness since Apple introduced iTunes Radio in mid-September. One can argue that most of Pandora's listeners are freeloaders, making this increase irrelevant. That's true. Just 3.3 million of its 75.3 million active listeners are paying Pandora for commercial-free access. The other 72 million are fine putting up with ads and any other limitations that Pandora may throw their way.

In terms of premium competition, Sirius XM Radio (NASDAQ:SIRI) listeners with satellite receiver plans can pay an additional $4 a month for online access. Pandora's pricing now makes its online offering more expensive than Sirius XM's add-on platform. That's worth noting.

This still doesn't make the price hike a dumb move by Pandora. If anything, pre-announcing that the increase will take place in May could encourage current freeloaders to sign up for the $3.99 a month in the next few weeks so that they will be grandfathered into the lower rate. The move should also help with Pandora One churn. Folks will be less tempted to cancel the service if they know that coming back would cost them $4.99 a month.

That's important. Netflix has also suggested that it will eventually roll out higher prices to new members, generously grandfathering in existing members at existing rates. Amazon isn't being as generous with Prime, though it is waiting until annual renewal dates to institute the $20 increase.

Leaning on the Internet for legal ad-free entertainment is starting to get more expensive. Now we have to see if consumers are willing to accept the increases.###5275||Empty###5276||Empty###5277||The board of directors is looking for someone with more security prowess.

In the week of Symantec’s firing of CEO Steve Bennett, a leading analyst familiar with the security firm has suggested he lacked the technical expertise for the role.

Bennett, who became CEO less than two years ago, was replaced by board member Michael Brown on an interim basis as the antivirus maker suffered from declining revenue and slumping shares.

A statement released by Symantec said that the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety".

However, Gene Ruth, the leading analyst of Symantec at Gartner, told CBR: "He was not a technical person and it’s possible that the board of directors were looking for someone that has more technical vision and prowess in that area.

"So my guess would be that now that the organisation has been set up and the implementations are underway now, what they need is a technically oriented person who can set the vision for the company, so I’d be looking for someone to come out of a high tech area to fill Steve shoes."

He added: "I sat down with him four days after he took the job and a couple of times after that. He’s a measured type of person, and he seemed quite interested and level-headed… and he knows how to build teams and get productivity out of teams."

The firm reported in January a 5% decline in revenue for the third quarter ending December 27, which Bennett blamed on changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.###5278||Turkey’s attempt to block access to Twitter appeared to backfire on Friday with many tech-savvy users circumventing the ban and suspicions growing that the prime minister was using court orders to suppress corruption allegations against him and his government.

Turkey’s telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to the social media network hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the website. Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis

Turkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country – to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.

President Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.

“I hope this implementation won’t last long,” he wrote.

Links to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan’s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.

Erdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.

“Prime Minister Erdogan’s move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Andrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain’s Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System – or DNS – blocking, which was easy to work around.

He said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google’s Domain Name System, which isn’t affected by the ban.

Earlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey’s lawyers’ association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey’s main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.

Twitter’s @policy account tweeted: “We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon.”

Earlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or “SMS.”

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey – a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.” Other EU officials also voiced concerns.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey’s minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders – although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy – not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating “personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives” and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

“Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,” Elvan said. “We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.”

Technology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.

The original source of the leaked recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news reports that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

“Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis,” said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch.

In Berlin, the German government’s human rights commissioner, Christoph Straesser, called on Turkey to reverse the decision immediately, saying “limiting freedom of the press and opinion on this scale is unacceptable.”

Britain’s Foreign Office also expressed concern, saying that social media has a “vital role to play” in modern democracy and helps promote transparency and public debate.###5279||Empty###5280||• Fed cuts tapering by USD 10bn to USD 55bn

• Unemployment threshold rate of 6.5% jettisoned

• EURUSD relatively stable in FOMC aftermath

The first meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) with the new chairwoman, Janet Yellen, concluded yesterday. At 18:00 GMT the statement was released, together with updated economic projections, and at 18:30 GMT Yellen faced journalists in the press conference.

Monthly purchases decreased by USD 10 billion

The FOMC decided to continue tapering its monthly-asset purchases. Beginning from April, the monthly purchases will be lowered by USD 10 billion to USD 55 billion. The Fed has indicated for a while and many times that it will stop the asset purchases before the year is over, and that the aim is to decrease the purchases at every FOMC meeting by the same amount.

Unemployment threshold jettisoned

Since December 2012, the forward guidance has pledged that rates would remain low as long as inflation is at 2.5 percent or less and as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent. As the unemployment rate hit a low of 6.6 percent last January, the guidance was hardly relevant. The Fed knows very well that the low unemployment rate paints a rather optimistic view of the labour market. Participation rate remains historically low and the number of people working part-time jobs for economic reasons is high, so the economy is far from full employment, or levels where the employment would cause inflationary pressures.

Instead of presenting new quantitative thresholds, the Fed stated that it will weigh ‘wide range of information’. This is actually the same as having no forward guidance at all. While this move toward traditional qualitative guidance was expected, it also makes analysts’ work harder as now they will have to estimate the economic variables and the Fed’s interpretation of those variables.

Connecting the dots: rate hikes in 2015

Without any concrete guidance, analysts looked at the economic projections and noticed that the majority of the FOMC saw the Federal funds rate reaching one percent by the end of 2015. Yellen tried to belittle the dot chart’s importance and that economist’s should concentrate on the FOMC statement for guidance. As the statement said that rates would remain low for a “considerable time” after asset purchases end, Yellen answered that it would “probably mean” around six months. Tapering is planned to be complete by the end of 2014, so the expected time frame is pretty clear.

View: hawkish now, dovish later?

The initial reaction was that the FOMC was more hawkish than expected. The chart, which I bravely posted before the event, shows that EURUSD has for the past year tended to fall after the FOMC, as expectations of “monetary candy” have built up, but the Fed has not delivered. This is again quite a similar situation. The end result was pretty much what was expected, but the dot plot and the lack of concrete guidance have led to a deflation of those ballooned hopes. After a while, markets will begin concentrating on the lack of concrete guidance, and then hopes will begin building up again.

The next key event will be the European Central Bank’s meeting on April 4, and as the same chart shows, the ECB-days have often been followed by a surging EURUSD. That has been the story of the EURUSD for some time now grinding slowly higher, but at the same time oscillating between Fed-highs and ECB-lows. Should the EURUSD remain bearish until the ECB-meeting, a visit lower towards channel bottoms could be on the cards. Short-term, the pair is sitting at the major support level of 1.3820, the highs from last October and December, and could see a bounce to perhaps 1.3850 or so.

Reactions: bond yields, USD surged, while stock plummeted

The futures market prices the first 25bps rate hike to happen in September 2015. The ten-year Treasury note yields rose from pre-FOMC 2.67 percent to a high of 2.792 percent. The bond yield has been trading in a range between 2.6 and roughly 2.8 percent since the beginning of February, and sooner or later could make another attempt toward the 3 percent-highs seen last December. EURUSD fell from 1.3920 to 1.3850-levels following the publication of the statement, and as Yellen’s press conference begun, the pair begun grinding lower hitting a low of 1.3810.

The cable operator, which generates about $500 million in annual revenue from its Los Angeles system, owes $7.2 million in fees for 2010 and 2011, and $2.5 million in fees from 2008 and 2009, according to the complaint.

TWC said in a prepared statement that it believes the lawsuit is without merit. "As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen," TWC said in the statement.

As The Los Angeles Times noted, the lawsuit was filed a few weeks after TWC announced that it would hike subscription fees on its cable systems in Southern California by about 6 percent on average.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Mar.20, 2014 - Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) today announced that its board of directors has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. This appointment follows the termination of Steve Bennett as the company's president and chief executive officer and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors. A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. On behalf of Symantec's board, chairman Daniel Schulman said, "We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.Mr. Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with VERITAS Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation. Under his leadership, Quantum grew from $3 billion to $6 billion in revenues and held market leadership positions in data back-up and archiving solutions. More recently, Mr. Brown has been a board chairman and chief executive officer coach for several successful technology companies prior to their acquisitions, including EqualLogic, Line 6 and The Echo Nest. In addition to his deep expertise in growing businesses, Mr. Brown has extensive experience in leading and developing executive management teams. Mr. Brown said, "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan. The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market. By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader." As interim president and chief executive officer, Mr. Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation. Mr. Brown will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee or Nominating and Governance Committee. Board member Robert S.

At the conclusion of Janet Yellen's first meeting as chair, the central bank announced a decision to reduce monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, down to $55 billion a month starting in April.

But the economy is still being supported through near-zero interest rates, which have been in place since 2008. As for when those rates would rise, policymakers decided to abandon their previous threshold of 6.5% unemployment, in favor of a broader view of the job market.

"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent," the statement said.

Forward guidance: The Fed modified its so-called forward guidance for a potential interest rate hike, because its previous guidance of 6.5% unemployment wasn't leaving much wiggle room.

The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in February. And according to its latest economic forecasts released Wednesday, the Fed now believes the unemployment rate could fall as low as 6.1% this year.

The Fed has now decided to move toward a more qualitative approach in determining interest rate policy.

"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments," Fed officials wrote in the statement.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Yellen said the job market has improved more than many had anticipated, though she stressed that it's still weak and offered a list of various labor market measures that the Fed would be looking at.

Yellen said repeatedly that the change in guidance does not signal any immediate shift in the Fed's current policy intentions. She said rates would likely remain low for a "considerable period" after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.

Investors were spooked after Yellen responded to a question by suggesting that a "considerable period" could be defined as around six months. That led investors to believe that rates could rise sooner than previously thought. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 100 points in afternoon trading.

Tapering: The Fed has been buying bonds -- mainly long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities -- since September 2012 in an attempt to stimulate the economy. But it began reducing the program this year in a process nicknamed "tapering."

The Fed has said it would continue its plan to taper by $10 billion a month unless its outlook for the economy changed substantially.

While the job market had been in a rut over the winter, economists have speculated that the slump was a temporary result of extreme weather, and indicators would recover in spring.

In its statement, the Fed said economic activity slowed during the winter months, "in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."

Yellen said bad weather contributed to a spate of weak economic data over the first few months of the year. But she said most Fed officials expect the drag from cold weather will "begin to wash out in second quarter."

Only one Fed member formally dissented against the statement. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota felt that the change in forward guidance could weaken the Fed's credibility and cause uncertainty.###5285||Why did this happen?

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching on their tablets and smartphones for the lowest prices while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals -- but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store's U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for "technological answers to saving them money and time."

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's "every day low price" model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs onto the Savings Catcher page on www.walmart.com/ and types in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data show that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.

"They're doing the work for me," said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. "The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away."###5288||Empty###5289||Airbnb Inc., the room-sharing service with accommodations in 192 countries, is raising money from investors including TPG Capital at a valuation of more than US$10 billion, said people with knowledge of the deal.

The financing will bring in several hundred million dollars, though the final amount hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal remains in flux. The San Francisco-based company, backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was valued at US$2.5 billion in 2012.

At US$10 billion, Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, which includes Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It would also be worth more than twice as much as publicly traded vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc.

A slew of technology startups have lately raised huge rounds of financing at increasing valuations, as corporate investors, hedge funds and mutual funds seek stakes in companies before they go public. Messaging application TangoMe Inc. today raised US$280 million from investors led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in a deal that values the startup at more than US$1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this week, Cloudera Inc. said it raised US$160 million, with more set to come from investors including Intel Corp., people with knowledge of the situation said.

Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb lets users rent out a couch, bedroom or house and makes money by charging a fee for each transaction. The company has listings in more than 34,000 cities, according to its website.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Airbnb’s financing. An Airbnb representative didn’t immediately have a comment. Adam Levine, TPG’s global head of public affairs, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.

Bloomberg.com###5290||Pandora will be raising its monthly subscription price by $1 starting in May due to increasing cost of operations that includes licensing fees.

The music streaming service will soon cost $4.99 a month, The Washington Post blog reported via the official Pandora announcement. People who are already subscribing to the premium streaming service will keep the $3.99 rate for now.

Pandora has 3.3 million paid subscribers and 250 million total registered users, according to the company.

The service will also no longer be available at the annual rate of $36, changing to a monthly option only.

Pandora cited costs of royalties as an impetus behind the change. Royalty rates that go to artists through SoundExchange have risen 53 percent in the past five years and are expected to increase 9 percent more next year, according to the Pandora blog.

The streaming service will continue to offer free, customizable listening stations with ads.

Even if users decide to go back to the free streaming option, Pandora will still make money, a report from CNNMoney noted.

Subscription fees brought in $52 million in 2013, only accounting for 12 percent of Pandora's total revenue last year, according to CNNMoney's analysis of the 2013 report.

The company actually makes more profit from users who listen to ads, compared with paid subscribers, Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Company, told CNNMoney.

"That subscription price needs to go up because the value of an hour of advertising is rising," she said. "Raising the price closes the gap of what that person is worth in an ad-driven world."

Pandora's competition, which includes Spotify, iHeart Radio and Rhapsody, continues to grow as streaming services like Apple's iTunes Radio and Beats Music come into the mix.

Despite the rise of similar services, Pandora is still the leader among its competitors and posted a $9 million profit last quarter, its largest since going public in 2011, according to The Washington Post blog.###5291||Empty###5292||UK Chancellor George Osborne will officially unveil the new £1 coin in today's budget announcement.

The new 12-sided coin is based on the old threepenny bit and will replace the current coin, which has been in circulation for 30 years. The new £1 coin will be introduced in 2017.

Osborne will reveal in his Budget 2014 speech that a replacement is needed because the pound coin has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

Royal Mint now estimates that about 45 million of £1 coins in circulation are forgeries.

"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," Osborne will say.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

The Treasury will also confirm that while the Queen will remain on one side, the other side's design will be open to public competition.

"The Bank welcomes [the] news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency," said the Bank of England in a press statement.###5293||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

Walmart is making plans to begin accepting trade-in video games on March 26, which will put a little bit of heat on GameStop, and other video game stores.

According to GameSpot, Walmart will begin taking trade-ins in 3,100 stores across the U.S, and will give consumers gift cards back as payment. This makes Walmart a little more enticing because the gift card can be used for other purchases within the store, whereas GameStop, they only have games to offer.

GameSpot reported, Walmart will send their games to a refurbishing center and get the games certified. They will also only be taking games and not consoles and hardware.

"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good," said Mac Naughton to GameSpot after being asked why the sudden change. "We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges."

Naughton also said they are planning to give back more money than any other video game trade-in place, pricing the average title at $35.

The NYTimes reported on the incredible profits on used games. It is a $2.4 billion global industry for GameStop alone, which is 27 percent of its sales. In America, GameStop made $1.6 billion on used games and hardware sales alone.

"It's extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins," said Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities to the NYTimes.

Used games are a touchy subject and a source of contention among developers and console makers as used game sales take away from new games sales, costing companies millions of dollars. However, it is a necessary evil because gamers will keep buying and selling games to grow their collections.

Microsoft tried to implement a used game system on the Xbox One that would require gamers to only register a game twice, and not work with used games. After public outcry, they reversed the policy.###5297||Wedbush Securities analysts Gil Luria, Aaron Turner take a close look at eBay and its recent numbers and news items.



We expect 2014 to be eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s comeback year as core business stabilizes, new initiatives scale and the company becomes more focused on returning cash to shareholders.

eBay and Icahn

We expect activist investor Icahn to propose his detailed reasoning for the spin-off of PayPal shortly. We believe Mr. Icahn will present his argument ahead of the shareholder meeting scheduled for early May.

We expect the following points to be made (with our quick thoughts):

1. PayPal will likely benefit from the power of focus. We believe PayPal is already the focus of all of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and most of its investments.

2. PayPal would be a more attractive employer. PayPal’s retention of acquired executives and longstanding reputation in Silicon Valley is already very attractive.

3. PayPal will be able to form relationships it is currently limited from forming. While we believe Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and/or Alibaba are unlikely to ever accept PayPal, we do think this is a key argument. In fact, we believe that if PayPal was independent AXP, MA and V may clamor to own the one and only property that gives a concentrated presence in the fastest growing segment of commerce, 143 million consumers and millions of merchant relationships.

Items in ebay’s favor

We believe that the current debate may encourage management to tilt the balance more towards delivering strong 2014 results, given the inverse relationship between support for spin-off and the share price.

Stable ecommerce, retail and currency should make upside easier to achieve (pages 2-4). Recent US data from comScore has shown improving trends in February and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s currency basket has recently been working in its favor.

Reiterate OUTPERFORM and price target of $70. Our price target represents a 20x P/FE multiple our 2015 estimate, a 10% discount to V and MA, the closest comparables, based on the size of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s opportunity, somewhat offset by management’s caution for 2014.###5298||Empty###5299||Top Company Interviews

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia | A satellite image released by China on Saturday offered the latest sign that wreckage from a Malaysia Airlines plane lost for more than two weeks could be in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean where planes and ships have been searching for three days.



The image, showing an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet), was taken around noon Tuesday. The image location was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of where an Australian satellite viewed two objects two days earlier. The larger object was about as long as the one the Chinese satellite detected.



"The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify," Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday.



Australian officials said the location was within the 36,000-square-kilometer (14,000-square-mile) area they searched on Saturday, but the object was not found. Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman Andrea Hayward-Maher said she did not know whether the precise coordinates of the location had been searched, but added that coordinators will use the information to refine the search area.



The authority, which is overseeing the search in the region, said a civil aircraft reported seeing a number of small objects in the search area, including a wooden pallet, but a New Zealand military plane diverted to the location found only clumps of seaweed. The agency said in a statement that searchers would keep trying to determine whether the objects are related to the lost plane.



The latest satellite image is another clue in the baffling search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which dropped off air traffic control screens March 8 over the Gulf of Thailand with 239 people on board.



After about a week of confusion, Malaysian authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



The discovery of the two objects by the Australian satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to a stretch of the Indian Ocean about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Australia. But three days of searching have produced no confirmed signs of the plane.



One of the objects spotted in the earlier satellite imagery was described as 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). The Boeing 777-200 is about 64 meters (209 feet) long with a wingspan of 61 meters (199 feet) and a fuselage about 6.2 meters (20 feet) in diameter, according to Boeing's website.



In a statement on its website announcing China's find, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense did not explain why it took four days to release the information. But there was a similar delay in the release of the Australian satellite images because experts needed time to examine them.



Two military planes from China arrived Saturday in Perth to join Australian, New Zealand and U.S. aircraft in the search. Japanese planes will arrive Sunday and ships were in the area or on their way.



Even if both satellites detected the same object, it may be unrelated to the plane. One possibility is that it could have fallen off a cargo vessel.###5301||Empty###5302||Crimea and Russia's finances





By Vestnik Kavkaza



The Russian ruble will be officially launched in the territory of Crimea on March 24th. At the moment the ruble exchange rate is growing in Crimean exchange offices. In Russia the ruble is strengthening in the context of reduction of geopolitical risks.



However, yesterday the USA decided to extend the list of Russian officials against whom strict sanctions are launched. 20 people have been included on the list, including the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, his deputy Alexei Gromov, the State Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin, the leader of A Just Russia Sergei Mironov, businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, businessman Yuri Kovalchuk, the owner of Volga Group Gennady Timchenko and the head of Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin. The US President stated that sanctions were being launched against “organizations which provide material support to the Russian government”, i.e. the bank ‘Rossiya’. Barack Obama also signed an order on possible sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy. Whether the sanctions will affect ordinary citizens of Russia is not clear.



Oleg Kazakovtsev, a member of the Federation Council Committee on Budgets and Financial Markets, says that people are only interested in one type of question: “If I have certain savings, will these savings remain? What should I do with them? How will I get my salary? Will the Central Bank fight inflation? These questions are major. People are trying to protect what they have saved. If we look at the market today as a whole, we'll see that there are very few mechanisms with which people can temporarily invest their savings: 80% are accounted for in bank deposits, some of them are accounted for in currencies, but people have generally taken the process of de-dollarization - in 1998 as well as in 2013 - rather calmly. There is another mechanism - through buying property, the only given document is a certificate of ownership and those who are able to still spend their money on real estate. The stock market for the majority is in fact unavailable. We have about 1 million citizens who own shares or are somehow involved in it. In comparison, in America more than 50 million people purchase shares, invest, try to earn something and so on,” Kazakovtsev says.



He thinks it is necessary for the Central Bank to adopt a more flexible policy. “Unfortunately, the policy carried out by the CB of revoking licenses is a relevant measure, but nevertheless every week licenses of regional banks are suspended. This creates an additional negative reaction among depositors. Not all the information reaches people. This all has its impact, and people are trying to purchase foreign currency. There is speculative demand. In 1998, for example, a threshold was introduced for commercial banks - 15%, that is, the addition to the currency price could not be higher than 15%. Now, when people come to the exchange office, they find out that either there is no currency or that some banks are trying to raise the price. As a result, the difference between the rate of the CB and the sale price in exchange offices is quite significant, which causes unexpected interest. I believe that today the Central Bank conducts audits and has resources. The issue is that, if there are doubts, let's make formal requests.”

The letter, dated Thursday, was signed by Reps. Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a "breakthrough" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that "a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it."

Due to Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado's and Pennsylvania's Medicaid programs had already announced that they're funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California's is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is "encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi."

Meanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.

Health insurer WellPoint (WLP) chimed in Friday with concerns about new hepatitis C drug costs, said executive Ken Goulet.

Biotech Stocks Cheaper

Gilead's (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), whose sole drug, Soliris, goes for upward of $400,000 a year, tumbled 8%. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which also sells an expensive hepatitis C drug called Incivek, retreated 5%.

Biogen Idec (BIIB), which has a costly multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, lost 8%.

IBD's top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 4.5%.

AbbVie (ABBV), which will likely come out with a rival and possibly cheaper rival to Sovaldi later this year, initially rallied Friday, but closed down a fraction.

"It's like Gilead caught a cold and the rest of the market caught pneumonia," said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Opportunity Fund .

Sovaldi A Bargain?

Analysts, for the most part, advised staying calm. Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that "pricing discussions could generate headline 'concern,' but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they're curing patients and improving society. ... HCV is an important public health issue (like HIV was) and validates the significance of this market."

Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a client note that she'd spoken to Gilead officials and they were already making their case that Sovaldi is actually a bargain.

"A liver transplant related to HCV costs up to $250,000 and another $50,000 each year for meds so that the person does not reject the liver," she wrote. "Gilead has co-pay programs in place (in which) the out-of-pocket cost is as low as $5."

ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex's Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year. Sovaldi's cure rate is also much higher than Incivek's, so the cost "per cure" is even better, he said in a webinar Friday.

Dems Seek 'Public Shaming'

Schoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a "public shaming" not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.

"This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi," Haines wrote.

Such a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a large nonprofit with a history of criticizing Gilead over its HIV drug pricing, recently turned its fire on Sovaldi.

"Gilead's latest display of out-of-touch greed comes on the heels of the company's January pricing its new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), at $1,000 per pill ... 1,100% more than Gilead's most expensive AIDS drug, Stribild," the AHF said in a Feb. 4 press release.

All this has played out as biotech stocks have hit a lull the last few weeks, after a bull run not seen since the 1990s, leading some to fear that the party may be over. Vandeventer says that while biotechs are a "high beta group," this is probably just a correction. After all, he points out, drug prices have been a political football since the early 1990s.

"It shouldn't be completely unexpected that these kinds of issues come to the fore periodically," he said. "It's just part of investing in health care."###5305||The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) released their joint critical systems review of Boeing’s 787-8 Dreamliner Wednesday. The review was initiated in January 2013, after a series of problems with the plane’s electrical system and batteries surfaced and eventually caused the entire fleet of 787s to be grounded for three months.

The review team consisted of six FAA officials and seven Boeing employees, who spent six months validating the 787’s certification process. The review committee’s report stated:

The CSRT [critical systems review team] determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane’s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification.

The review team made four recommendations:

Boeing should establish a means to ensure suppliers identify program risks and complementary mitigation plans. Boeing should continue to implement and mature the gated design and production processes with sufficient resources for development programs, and to minimize risks throughout the life cycle of the program. (“Gated” design establishes a series of programmatic criteria (gates) that must be met before moving to the next development phase.) Boeing should ensure suppliers are fully aware of their responsibilities, including integration responsibilities and accountability for subtier performance. Boeing should require its suppliers to follow industry standards for the training, qualification and certification of supplier personnel performing Boeing-required (non-FAA) inspections.

The panel also recommended that the FAA make three changes to its policy and guidance documents.

The CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane division said:

The findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise.

Boeing stock was down about 0.1% in the noon hour Wednesday, at $123.89 in a 52-week range of $83.80 to $144.57.###5306||Mar 19 2014 | 10:26am ET

New York is taking a closer look at high-frequency traders—and how stock exchanges are helping them, for a price.

Eric Schneiderman, the state’s attorney general, said he has opened an investigation into the sale of products and services that offer high-frequency traders faster access to data. Schneiderman has made the combating of what he calls “Insider Trading 2.0” a central focus.

Stock markets charge traders thousands of dollars to “co-locate” their servers at the exchanges’ data centers, giving them access to data milliseconds before those whose servers are elsewhere. Schneiderman is also looking at dark pools and at high-frequency traders themselves.

“This new breed of predatory behavior gives a small segment of the industry an enormous advantage over all other competitors and allows them to use new technologies to reap huge profits based on very, very minor, but nonetheless unfair, advantages,” Schneiderman said yesterday. “Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets, as structured today, are increasingly too focused on catering to them.”

The attorney general said he would push for new rules to curtail those advantages.

“My office is going to continue to shine a light on unseemly practices,” Schneiderman said. “I look forward to joining with other regulators and my colleagues in government in taking real, concrete steps to deal with this problem.”###5307||Sally Beauty is the latest retailer to fall victim to hackers.

Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle Corporation's previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals.

On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors' targets.

Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion.

She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts' consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said.

"They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story," said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. "Investors need to see more. It continues to be a 'prove me' stock in the eyes of investors."

The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit.

SOFTWARE BUSINESS STILL WEAK

Revenue from Oracle Corporation's hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company's $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company's core software business, said Ives.

Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

In response, four-decade-old Oracle Corporation has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc.

"They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example," said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. "They're playing catch up, but they're working quickly and they're starting to make some progress."

On Tuesday's call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.

On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle Corporation is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company's salesforce last year.

"We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now," Hurd said. "We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer."

Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.

Most of Oracle's business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.

Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.

For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.

Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.

Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The EU commissioner on digital affairs, Neelie Kroes, tweeted on Thursday (20 March) that the move “is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl [international] community will see this as censorship. It is.”

Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, himself a prolific user of the US micro-blogging site, noted: “Erdogan is not only damaging himself, but his entire nation.”

The EU’s former ambassador to Turkey, Marc Pierini, now an analyst at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels, said: “Turkey is estranging itself from the world.”

The ban entered into force shortly before midnight on Thursday.

It came just a few hours after Erdogan at a party rally in Bursa, near Istanbul, ahead of local elections on 30 March, said: “We now have a court order. We will dig up Twitter and so on - all of them - by the roots… I don't care what the international community says. They will see the Turkish republic's strength.”

His press service later noted: “It is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens.”

The “court rulings” refer to a Twitter account called Haramzadeler, meaning “son of thieves” in Turkish, which has been publishing leaked documents on alleged corruption in Erdogan’s inner circle.

The Haramzadeler leaks are part of wider anti-Erdogan exposures which began late last year, when he fell out with Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic teacher living in the US, over education reforms.

A Turkish official told Reuters “at the moment there is no [similar] decision for other social media like Facebook.”

The Twitter ban comes after Turkey in February passed a new law giving authorities the right to block access to websites if they are seen as having "insulting” content.

It also comes after Erdogan established political control over judicial appointments and fired hundreds of policemen and prosecutors looking into the corruption affair.

Even before the new measures, Turkey already ranked among the lowest of the low in terms of free speech.

It arrested more government-critical journalists than China or Iran last year, while the Twitter ban puts it in the company of China, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, and Pakistan.

Some MEPs have said accession talks, revived last year after a long gap, should once again be put on hold, while some EU officials, in private conversations, have likened Erdogan to Europe’s Communist-era autocrats.

Amid mounting, and at times deadly, clashes between young anti-government protesters and Erdogan’s police, the Twitter ban also risks backfiring inside Turkey, which has more than 12 million Twitter users.

Twitter itself noted that users can get round the ban by posting tweets via SMS-es from their mobile phones.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey trended to the top of worldwide postings on the site late on Thursday and early on Friday, with the majority of the #TwitterisblockedinTurkey posts coming from inside Turkey despite the restriction.

BMW is targeting a significant improvement in 2014 sales volume, that would take the company to a new all-time high of more than 2.0 million vehicles. The pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses, the company said.

In spite of substantial levels of investment in new technologies, the Automotive division would again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8% - 10%. The Motorcycles segment sales are forecast to be slightly up over last year, not least due to the contribution expected from the new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs. In 2014, the Financial Services segment is likely to also remain on growth course.

The current year forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

At the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2014, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board would propose to shareholders that the dividend be increased to a new highest level of 2.60 euros per common share and 2.62 euros per preferred share.

The program, announced today, will begin on March 26. Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing offer, Duncan Mac Naughton, said the company was "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," a market GameStop dominates in the United States.

Walmart will accept used-game trade-ins at more than 3,100 stores in the U.S.. Trade-ins will not be accepted at the company's Sam's Club or neighborhood market locations (or where prohibited by local law) but the store credit one receives for a trade-in at a Walmart is usable at any Walmart location, or online.

Additionally, beginning this summer, Walmart will begin offering pre-owned games in its store and online. The retailer launched this ad to spread news of the program.





Walmart dabbled in used game trade-ins before, albeit through kiosks it tried out in certain stores in 2009; the plan didn't work and was discontinued. Currently Walmart accepts trade-ins of tablets, smartphones, mp3 players and other devices, but not game consoles.###5314||Thank you for Reading.

Etowah County’s unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in January, up from December’s 5.6 percent.

Every county in the state saw its unemployment rate rise in January.

The state rate, which is seasonally adjusted while county rates are not, remained at 6.1 percent.

The non-seasonally adjusted state unemployment rate would have increased from 5.7 percent in December to 6.8 percent in January.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique that attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns to reveal how employment and unemployment change from month to month.

The county’s unemployment rate dropped for three consecutive months last year before seeing an increase in December.###5316||Why did this happen?

Mannheim-based think tank ZEW's monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

It was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

“The Crimea Crisis is weighing on expert's economic expectations for Germany,” said ZEW president Clemens Fuest.

“Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War.

The United States and European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.

The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0 yet still underscoring the strength of the German economy.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said the combination of emerging market turbulence earlier this year and the stand-off between Russia and the West may have a “mildly dampening impact on Germany's investment climate” and therefore on growth.

But he noted that “it would take a much more serious crisis in Ukraine to derail the recovery in Germany and the euro zone as a whole”.

The German economy, a growth locomotive in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8 percent this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.

Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January.

Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.

The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said. - Reuters###5328||Empty###5329||Empty###5330||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt.

The executive in charge of the cloud business, the CFO the Senior Vice President and the heads of both enterprise and consumer business at Symantec have left since Bennett's appointment. On top of that Symantec has failed to attract new talent as engineers are attracted instead to new competitors such as FireEye and Palo Alto networks as well as to security roles within other technology companies.

One thing that public markets really hate is ongoing executive churn within a company. So the news today that Symantec Corp has fired its president and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such move in less than two years, will cause real concern.

Symantec is well known for producing the Norton AntiVirus software, but it's fair to say that the move away from PCs, the increasing use of software subscription models and related lessening appetite for licence-based products alongside the rise of mobile applications have all created a very unstable marketplace for the company. While other companies have seen the mid-term horizon and managed to make some big changes (a good example being Dell which went private in order to have the freedom to embark on a new strategy built on the back of becoming a services-based business), Symantec has been less successful at navigating this path.

The company has been working through a reorganization plan to deal with weak earnings, but reorganization is different from reinvention and this is something that Symantec will come to realize. This is perhaps the rationale for the firing, said Chairman Daniel Schulman;

This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety

As a temporary measure, the company has named Michael Brown as interim president and CEO, effective immediately but, at the same time, has begun a search for a permanent replacement. Bennett joined the Symantec board in 2010 after stints at General Electric and Intuit. He took the CEO role in July 2012 after the board "requested" that Enrique Salem step down from the role.

As for the interim CEO, Brown joined the board following the merger with Veritas Software in 2005. Previously he served as both chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

I reached out to Symantec to see what the move means in light of the company's need to truly reimagine what it fundamentally does as a business. Symantec declined to comment and referred me to their press release which, unfortunately for the company, flags some turbulent waters to come, at least in terms of revenue.###5334||Empty###5335||Empty###5336||Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, hours after the country's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "eradicate" the social network in response to alleged recordings of him making corrupt statements being posted on the site.

Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, hours after the country's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "eradicate" the social network in response to alleged recordings of him making corrupt statements being posted on the site.

A number of incriminating wiretaps, including one in which Erdogan supposedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence during a police graft probe, have surfaced on the internet in the past weeks.

Erdogan denies corruption and says the recording was a fabrication. The leaks come at a particular sensitive time for the government with key local elections taking place this month.

Speaking at a rally on Thursday Erdogan said: "We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic."

By the early hours of Friday morning, the country’s 10 million Twitter users began to report access the site being blocked. They are now confronted with a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing court orders as reason for the site's closure.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban on her Twitter account as "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

"Turkish people and the (international) community will see this as censorship. It is," she s

Turkey has no current plans to block access to other social media platforms such as Facebook, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on Friday.

"The path was taken to block access within the framework of a court decision because of the failure to overcome the problem with the management of Twitter," the official said.

Independent News Service###5337||###5338||Istanbul: Turkish President Abdullah Gul set himself publicly at odds with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, saying that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter.

Turkey’s courts blocked access to Twitter following Erdogan’s vow, on the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, to ‘wipe out’ the service. In a defiant stand, Erdogan said he did not care what the international community had to say about it.

The prime minister, who has been in power for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing.

Gul, however, took to Twitter himself to say complete bans on social media platforms were unacceptable and to voice his hope that the block would be short-lived.

Turkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.

“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted. He said that individual internet pages should only be blocked if there is a court order on the grounds that a person’s privacy is being violated.

Gul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has remained a close ally, but he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure than the combative prime minister and their relationship has at times appeared strained.

In the run up to the elections, the president has been hesitant to openly criticise Erdogan, despite the brewing scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government. Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a corruption scandal Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content.

“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

Twitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread internet disconnections on Thursday night. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said he was ‘gravely concerned’ by the move.

“Being free to communicate and freely choose the means to do it is [a] fundamental EU value,” Fuele wrote on his Twitter account.

Turkey’s financial markets were also unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares falling 0.7 per cent and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 per cent from 11.12.

San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the social media service on Thursday. “Twitter, mwitter!”, he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.

“We will wipe out all of these,” Erdogan said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the republic of Turkey is,” he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.###5339||In a seven-episode In Contrast podcast special “What’s Wrong with American Media?,” public intellectual and host of In Contrast Ilan Stavans and veteran journalist Ray Suarez look at Murrow’s message in the age of “fake news.”

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."###5343||###5344||Empty###5345||Moving along the same lines, the Canadian mortgage lender, Toronto Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD), decided to make no changes to its benchmark 30 year fixed mortgage interest rates on March 21, 2014. The eligible borrowers, who are seeking ideal home purchase or refinancing home loans from TD Bank this Friday, will have to deal with the same interest rates as yesterday, which will certainly not have any serious impact on the overall demand of its loan products in the market.

Today, in the standard, long term home loan department, 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loan deals are being advertised at an interest rate of 4.438% and are carrying an annual percentage rate of 4.551% today. However, in the relatively shorter home financing section, the bank is offering its 15 year fixed rate mortgage home loan deals at an interest rate of 3.438% and an annual return rate of 3.632% this Friday.

With regards to the flexible home loan options, the potential customers can find the best 3 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans being listed against an interest rate of 2.688% and being backed by an APR yield of 2.839% to begin with. On the other hand, the 5 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans are now coming out at an interest price of 3.062% and are backed by an APR yield of 2.961% during the starting years of the home loan tenure.

For the borrowers, who are interested in securing more flexible home loan deals, the bank is offering its best 7 year adjustable rate mortgage packages at a starting interest rate of 3.438% and an annual return rate of 3.172% to start with. Alternatively, the 10 year adjustable rate mortgage home loan deals can be locked in at a lending rate of 3.688% and an annual percentage rate of 3.431% today.

Shifting sights towards the refinancing division, the customers who are looking forward to refinance their existing investments, can spot the popular 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loans being published at an interest rate of 4.688% and being backed by an APR yield of 4.803% today. On the other hand, the short term, 15 year counterparts of the 30 year refinancing fixed rate mortgage home loan plans can be acquired at an interest rate of 3.688% and an APR yield of 3.883% this Friday.

As far as the flexible home loan deals are concerned, the Canadian mortgage lender is providing the 5 year refinancing adjustable rate home loans at a starting interest price of 3.312% and an APR yield of 3.048% to start with. However, the more flexible, 7 year refinancing adjustable rate mortgage home loan options can be seen tagged with an interest cost of 3.688% and offering an APR yield of 3.290% on the basic amount of home loan acquired from the bank.

• Unemployment threshold rate of 6.5% jettisoned

• EURUSD relatively stable in FOMC aftermath

The first meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) with the new chairwoman, Janet Yellen, concluded yesterday. At 18:00 GMT the statement was released, together with updated economic projections, and at 18:30 GMT Yellen faced journalists in the press conference.

Monthly purchases decreased by USD 10 billion

The FOMC decided to continue tapering its monthly-asset purchases. Beginning from April, the monthly purchases will be lowered by USD 10 billion to USD 55 billion. The Fed has indicated for a while and many times that it will stop the asset purchases before the year is over, and that the aim is to decrease the purchases at every FOMC meeting by the same amount.

Unemployment threshold jettisoned

Since December 2012, the forward guidance has pledged that rates would remain low as long as inflation is at 2.5 percent or less and as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent. As the unemployment rate hit a low of 6.6 percent last January, the guidance was hardly relevant. The Fed knows very well that the low unemployment rate paints a rather optimistic view of the labour market. Participation rate remains historically low and the number of people working part-time jobs for economic reasons is high, so the economy is far from full employment, or levels where the employment would cause inflationary pressures.

Instead of presenting new quantitative thresholds, the Fed stated that it will weigh ‘wide range of information’. This is actually the same as having no forward guidance at all. While this move toward traditional qualitative guidance was expected, it also makes analysts’ work harder as now they will have to estimate the economic variables and the Fed’s interpretation of those variables.

Connecting the dots: rate hikes in 2015

Without any concrete guidance, analysts looked at the economic projections and noticed that the majority of the FOMC saw the Federal funds rate reaching one percent by the end of 2015. Yellen tried to belittle the dot chart’s importance and that economist’s should concentrate on the FOMC statement for guidance. As the statement said that rates would remain low for a “considerable time” after asset purchases end, Yellen answered that it would “probably mean” around six months. Tapering is planned to be complete by the end of 2014, so the expected time frame is pretty clear.

View: hawkish now, dovish later?

The initial reaction was that the FOMC was more hawkish than expected. The chart, which I bravely posted before the event, shows that EURUSD has for the past year tended to fall after the FOMC, as expectations of “monetary candy” have built up, but the Fed has not delivered. This is again quite a similar situation. The end result was pretty much what was expected, but the dot plot and the lack of concrete guidance have led to a deflation of those ballooned hopes. After a while, markets will begin concentrating on the lack of concrete guidance, and then hopes will begin building up again.

The next key event will be the European Central Bank’s meeting on April 4, and as the same chart shows, the ECB-days have often been followed by a surging EURUSD. That has been the story of the EURUSD for some time now grinding slowly higher, but at the same time oscillating between Fed-highs and ECB-lows. Should the EURUSD remain bearish until the ECB-meeting, a visit lower towards channel bottoms could be on the cards. Short-term, the pair is sitting at the major support level of 1.3820, the highs from last October and December, and could see a bounce to perhaps 1.3850 or so.

Reactions: bond yields, USD surged, while stock plummeted

The futures market prices the first 25bps rate hike to happen in September 2015. The ten-year Treasury note yields rose from pre-FOMC 2.67 percent to a high of 2.792 percent. The bond yield has been trading in a range between 2.6 and roughly 2.8 percent since the beginning of February, and sooner or later could make another attempt toward the 3 percent-highs seen last December. EURUSD fell from 1.3920 to 1.3850-levels following the publication of the statement, and as Yellen’s press conference begun, the pair begun grinding lower hitting a low of 1.3810.

Summary of Economic Projections March 19

Summary of Economic Projections December 18###5348||###5349||Most of the major currency pairs are trading higher this morning or making their way into positive territory. Foreign exchange investors have nerves of steel today, bidding up euro on the official announcement of sanctions on Russian politicians by the U.S. and EU. The U.S. announced plans to freeze the assets of 11 key Russian and Ukrainian officials and the EU will impose sanctions on 21 members of the Ukrainian and Russian government involved in Moscow’s incursion into Crimea. The euro is responding well to these initial measures because they are limited to a small group but today’s announcements represent the international community’s very first response to Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. If Russian troops move into Ukraine, more severe and widespread sanctions are sure to follow. There is very little chance that Russia will bat an eye at these sections. In fact, Putin has threatened his own restrictions, which could be announced in the coming hours or days. So while risk appetite has improved today, under these circumstances, it will be very difficult for the optimism to be sustained because there is a high risk of the crisis in the Ukraine deepening. However, until Russia retaliates investors are buying euros on the relief that the initial sanctions are mild and the currency could aim for fresh 2-year highs.

The aftermath of the referendum in Crimea this weekend is not the only big story in the foreign exchange market. On Saturday, China also doubled its Chinese Yuan trading band. They will now allow the CNY to fluctuate 2% above or below its daily midpoint rate, up from 1%. Given the currency’s recent rapid decent, this decision was not a complete surprise and had only a limited impact on major currencies. Nonetheless it represents a major shift in FX policy for the central bank. The PBoC is clearly using the exchange rate as a means to increase stimulus and provide additional support to its economy as growth slows. With exports falling by the largest amount in more than 4 years during the month of February, the economy could certainly use the support of a weaker currency, which helps to make the cost of Chinese imports more competitive. Although the central bank argues that today’s move is a step towards increasing exchange rate flexibility and greater two-way volatility in the currency, in the context of falling exports the recent slide in the Yuan clearly reflects an attempt to support the economy. A weaker Yuan hurts countries like Australia and Japan who rely heavily on Chinese demand. However even though trade balances could suffer, the AUD and JPY have taken the band winding in stride. For the U.S., China’s announcement impacts the dollar by slowing reserve accumulation. Yet like AUD and JPY, there has been very little reaction in the U.S. dollar.

This morning’s U.S. economic reports did not have much impact on the greenback. Manufacturing activity in the NY region increased slightly less than expected in the month of March but concerns about the sector was offset by a strong rise in industrial and manufacturing production along with an increase in capacity utilization. The NAHB housing market index rose, reflecting an improvement in builder confidence but the increase fell short expectations. As long as these reports show an improvement in the economy, it poses very little threat to the dollar ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC rate decision.###5350||Last Updated: 24 Oct 2014

The website, which matches up travellers and people with rooms to rent, is reportedly close to securing a private fundraising at a valuation for the whole business of $10bn.



That would make it more valuable than either Hyatt ($8.4bn) or IHG ($8bn), despite the fact that both these firms have substantial international networks of physical assets (hotels to you and me), while Airbnb doesn’t own so much as a single bed.



It also makes Airbnb the joint most-valuable VC backed start up on the planet, alongside Dropbox and Chinese smartphone biz Xiaomi, despite the fact that the firm has never disclosed either its revenue or profits. Co-founders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gabbia - who started the firm only six years ago in San Francisco - will become the sharing economy’s first paper bilionaires.



The funding round is expected to net between $400m and $500m, and is being led by TPG (the private equity group behind car-sharing outfit Uber’s fundraising last year). Airbnb, which claims to have hosted over 11m guests since it began, is expected to use the money to expand into peer-to-peer cleaning and transport services.



Given that the firm’s last fundraising two-and-half years ago valued it at a mere $2.5bn, this new round is being seen as a major endorsement for the sharing business model. (Read MT's recent feature on the business of sharing).



But novel and thrifty as it is, this modus operandi is not without perils, as a steady stream of punter horror stories attest. Take this one from the Sydney Morning Herald about an airbnb rental in New York used to host a ‘sex freak party’, resulting in eviction and a bill for $87,000 for the apartment’s hapless tenant.



Such glitches aside, the valuation - coming as it does only a month after Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp - will certainly add to fears that a big bubble is inflating in the tech sector. If and when it bursts, it won’t just be the shareconomy that feels the pain…



###5351||Empty###5352||WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached a $1 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp over the automaker's handling of consumer complaints tied to unintended vehicle acceleration and is set to announce the agreement as early as Wednesday, CNN reported.

Sources familiar with the deal told CNN that Toyota was expected to avoid criminal charges.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan has been probing allegations the Japanese company misled U.S. authorities after the complaints about the unintended acceleration emerged. The acceleration issue prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles beginning in 2009.

"Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," a Toyota spokeswoman told CNN. "During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Officials at the U.S. Attorney General's Office could not immediately be reached for comment.

The automaker last year paid more than $1 billion to resolve economic-loss claims related to the recall.

(Reporting by Peter Cooney; Editing by Eric Walsh)###5353||The shares of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) fluctuated today after the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the ruling of the Federal Reserve concerning debit card swipe fees reasonable.

Visa and Mastercard stock movements

The stock price of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) traded in the range opened at $223.17 per share and then it fluctuated from $219.70 to $232.6 per share and eventually closed at $223.37, up by 0.70%.

On the other hand, the equities of Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) opened at $79.34 per share. The stock traded from $79.50 per share to $79.83 a share and eventually closed at $75.99 per share, down by 3.09%.

Court of Appeals ruling on Debit Card Swipe Fees

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated that the Federal Reserve ensure that interchange fees reflect the actual cost of processing debit cards transactions. In order to comply with the law, the Federal Reserve initially proposed limiting the fees to $0.12 per debit card transaction, but finally set it to $0.21 per swipe with the possibility of a few cents increase to cover some costs such as fraud. Prior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.

Several retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) among others filed a case requesting a federal judge to nullify the ruling of the Federal Reserve. Last year, a District Court Judge in Washington tossed the Federal Reserve rule and cited that it misinterpreted the Dodd-Frank law. District Court Judge Richard Leon opined that the Fed rule “utterly indefensible” interpretation and “runs completely afoul of the text, design and purpose” of the Dodd-Frank law.

Today, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees. However, the court noted that the Dodd-Frank amendment was written poorly and a clarification is necessary to determine the appropriate cap for debit card transaction fees. The Court of Appeal said, “Its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”

Analysts’ comments

In a note to investors, Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies believed that the ruling of the Court of Appeals is positive for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) as it eliminates concerns regarding its superior U.S. signature debit market share being eroded by increased competition, which should have been the case if the fed lost the exclusivity part of the appeal.

Kupferberg believe that the ruling will “likely be an incremental positive” for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and it “would reduce potential risks of further downward pressure on debit network fees paid by issuers.”

On the other hand, analysts at JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) opined that the ruling was a “big win” for the payments industry particularly for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) because it can keep its 70% share in the signature debit card market.###5354||Empty###5355||The crew of one of two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft used in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 walk away from their plane in Perth.

France has provided new satellite data showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.

The new information, given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia, shows "potential objects" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

It was one of the last calls made to or from the mobile of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah in the hours before his Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur, the Mail Online reported.

Anyone buying a pay-as-you-go SIM card in Malaysia has to fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number.

In this case, police traced the number to a shop selling SIM cards in Kuala Lumpur.

They found that it had been bought "very recently" by someone who gave a woman's name - but was using a false identity.

There has been speculation that Zaharie, 53, was linked to anti-government protest groups in Malaysia.

Everyone else who spoke to the pilot on his phone in the hours before the flight took off has already been interviewed.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud", Royal Australian Air Force flight Lieutenant Russell Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.



Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."



Details on the French data were not immediately released. The statement from Malaysia called the information "new satellite images", while a statement from France's Foreign Ministry said "radar echoes taken by a satellite" had located floating debris but made no mention of imagery.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is leading the search in waters off Australia, declined to offer details about the information from France. The authority did not respond to multiple requests by The Associated Press for access to the data.



"Any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans," AMSA said.

But a Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data consisted of radar echoes captured on Friday and converted into fuzzy images that located objects about 930 kilometres north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured on Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22m by 13m, said the official, who declined to be identified because he isn't authorised to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.



Information about the new data emerged as authorities coordinating the search, which is being conducted about 2500km southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours. It was spotted on Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a New Zealand air force Orion dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.



"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue co-ordination centre. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

Royal New Zealand Air Force Air Commodore Mike Yardley said there had been no sightings of interest. The only thing the crew saw was seaweed. A picture of something floating in the southern Indian Ocean, as seen from the New Zealand Orion was released.

The sighting of a wooden pallet raised hopes. While they were commonly used in shipping, they could also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.



AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.



"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."



Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of Sunday night.



Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether flight MH370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared, but did not immediately respond to the email.



An official with Malaysia Airlines said on Sunday night that the flight was carrying wooden pallets but provided no further details, including the number of pallets.



When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they first found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.



The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

- AP, Fairfax NZ###5356||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec fired chief executive Steve Bennett on Thursday US time, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell as much as 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company said the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Symantec is facing stiff competition from nimbler network security software makers such as Palo Alto Networks and Checkpoint Systems.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you just add this to the list," Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for the fourth quarter.

The California-based company's shares closed at US$20.90 on Thursday US time on the Nasdaq.###5357||The US dollar exchange rate complex has seen a strong 24 hours with the US unit proving to be the best performer on Wednesday. However, the UK currency was the second-best performer.

Dollar Soars as End of ZIRP in Sight

The Federal Reserve left investors with a very clear message overnight.

Janet Yellen began to set expectations for tightening. Bernanke went to lengths to make it known than tapering does not equal tightening but Yellen spoke about how and when rates will be increased.

"In fact there was an entire new paragraph dedicated to how the central bank will approach the removal of policy accommodation and what sent stocks plunging and the dollar soaring was Yellen's comment that the first rate will most likely be 6 months after Quantitative Easing ends," says Kathy Lien at BK Asset Management.

According to Lien if the Fed maintains its current pace of tapering, asset purchases will cease in the fall, which means that the first rate hike will be in the summer of 2015.

The net result has been a bullish US dollar exchange rate complex and a weaker commodity dollar complex.

China released a satellite image showing an object floating in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean near where planes and ships have been crisscrossing since similar images from an Australian satellite emerged earlier in the week. China's image, showing an object that appeared to be 72 feet 43 feet, was taken around noon Tuesday.

Australian officials said the location was within the 14,000-square-mile area they searched today, but the object was not found. An Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman she did not know whether the precise coordinates of the location had been searched, but added that coordinators will use the information to refine the search area. The authority, which is overseeing the search in the region, said a civil aircraft reported seeing a number of small objects in the search area, including a wooden pallet, but a New Zealand military plane diverted to the location found only clumps of seaweed. The agency said searchers would keep trying to determine whether the objects are related to the lost plane.###5362||Empty###5363||Empty###5364||Empty###5365||Empty###5366||The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data Monday on the unemployment rates in the 50 states and District of Columbia.

Bennett took over Symantec's reigns in mid-2012 and initiated several organizational changes to counter the company's lower sales and profitability.

However, while the realignment of the organization's structure by eliminating several mid-level management positions bolstered the bottom line, sales force reorganizations have not yet yielded the desired results. On the other hand, Symantec's sales were impacted by the disruptions in customer relationships.

Moreover, the weak PC market is affecting the sales of Symantec's security solutions. As per the latest report from IDC, PC shipments will drop 6.1% in 2014, the third consecutive year of decline. This will affect the sale of Symantec's PC security solutions and business volume to a considerable extent.

To counter this decline, the company is concentrating more on the mobile business, which will enable it to generate additional volumes.

Nonetheless, Symantec reiterated fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 guidance reflecting that the CEO's exit would not have a material impact on the company's operations.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion reported in the year-ago period.

Non-GAAP operating margins are also unchanged at 24.5% to 26.0% compared to 24.1% last year. Management also expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 40 cents and 42 cents compared with 44 cents in the year-ago period.

Symantec is making efforts to attract small and mid-sized businesses with the introduction of enhanced versions of storage management and Internet security solutions. These solutions are primarily targeted at information-driven businesses.

However, the company faces increased competition from other bellwethers such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Intel ( INTC ).

Currently, Symantec has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock at this time would be Juniper Networks ( JNPR ), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).###5368||Empty###5369||Empty###5370||* Yen continues to lose safe-haven glow

* Focus on Putin speech later in session

* U.S. CPI, housing-related data awaited

By Shinichi Saoshiro

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen stayed below a recent peak against the dollar and the euro stood firm on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar held steady at 101.76 yen, staying above a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday. The dollar gained some support against the yen after U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday as safety demand for government debt receded.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.3934, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit on Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

Against the yen, the euro edged up 0.1 percent to about 141.79 yen.

After Sunday’s referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and the European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

“In immediate focus is Russian president Putin’s speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

“But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving U.S. government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar,” he said.

PUTIN SPEECH

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia’s State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow’s involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia’s armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

One possible resistance level for the dollar against the yen now lies around 102.30 yen, said Philip Wee, senior currency economist for DBS Bank in Singapore.

The dollar’s 20-day moving average now lies roughly around 102.30 yen, while the 100-day moving average comes in slightly above that level, around 102.38 yen.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8729. The dollar had hit a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8698 against the Swiss franc last week on trading platform EBS, but has since pulled up from that trough as investor risk aversion ebbed.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, was at 79.355, clinging above a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the U.S. consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar’s likely direction.###5371||Text size

GameStop shares are being zapped on worries about Wal-Mart 's entry into the used-videogame market.

Early Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores (ticker: WMT) announced that on March 26 it would begin accepting used videogames from customers, who could then use the value of their trade-in for any purchases at the chain or at its Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart will in turn refurbish the games and sell them in "like-new condition."

While Wal-Mart was flat in recent trading, GameStop (GME) shares fell 4.2% to $38.06 on the news. However, we think the market is underestimating GameStop's expertise and staying power.

Certainly, Wal-Mart's entering the fray is a near-term negative for GameStop, as it provides a new competitor and headline risk for the stock.

Yet this is not the first time that a bigger, deeper-pocketed retailer has tried and failed to thrive in the used-videogame market. As Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Arvind Bhatia notes, companies from Best Buy (BBY) to Target (TGT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have tried to move in on GameStop's business.

"Some of them have made multiple attempts over the years, including Best Buy, which we recall has attempted it at least on four different occasions in the last console cycle. None of the retailers so far has had much success. It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well. However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying 1 disc at a time from customers," notes Bhatia.

Bhatia argues that GameStop has "many inherent competitive advantages as the expert in video games" that make it difficult for others to steal its business: The company has a dedicated refurbishing center, an algorithm for pricing perfected over the past decade, and a customer loyalty program.

Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson is another bull, who advises buying the stock on Tuesday's weakness, as he thinks Wal-Mart's impact will be "immaterial" to GameStop's used-videogame business. He notes that Wal-Mart will be at a disadvantage to GameStop because "GameStop typically offers both cash and store credit (Wal-Mart offering only store credit); GameStop accepts both video game hardware and software, which gamers often trade-in together (Wal-Mart accepts only software) [and] GameStop is a destination for gamers (Wal-Mart sells video game hardware and software, but this is a small sub-segment of their business)."

And while GameStop may not be close in size to the world's largest retailer, it is a healthy company with dominant market share. It's debt free, with about $5 per share of cash on its balance sheet, which it has used to boost its generous 3.4% yield and buy back shares.

Early this year, Barron's recommended GameStop shares, arguing that investors were overreacting to the company's weak holiday sales. (See Follow Up, "GameStop Has 50% Upside," Jan. 18). The shares are up 1.6% since that article's publication, just edging ahead of the Standard & Poor's 500's return during the same period.

Even skeptics note that GameStop isn't resting on its laurels. S&P Capital IQ analyst Efraim Levy, who downgraded the stock to Hold on the news, notes that "GameStop is already adjusting to increasing its focus on sales of digital content and for mobile devices."

Levy's new price target assumes a valuation of 11 times 2015 earnings, but with today's dip the shares are already trading at just over 10 times.

So it's too soon to count out GameStop.

E-mail: teresa.rivas@barrons.com###5372||Less than two years after being hired by Symantec Corp., CEO Steve Bennett was ousted by the security giant's board Thursday, but according to industry observers familiar with Symantec, its struggles to define and execute a security product strategy go far deeper than any one executive.

They don't know who they are, they don't know what they want to do, and that's infiltrating all the way through their organization. J.J. Thompson,

CEO, Rook Security

Much of Bennett's time at Big Yellow was spent implementing what he termed the Symantec 4.0 strategy, which mostly focused on paring back products, services and staff. Though Symantec's stock price more than doubled during his first year, Bennett was unable to maintain that momentum; the stock price has dipped 15% in the past year. Similarly, sales of Symantec's line of consumer products, headlined by its Norton-branded endpoint antimalware technology, declined 2.8% in 2013, a foreboding statistic considering how closely linked the company's brand is with traditional endpoint security.

Chris Rodriguez, network security senior industry analyst at San Antonio, Texas-based consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, said that while Symantec has products in emerging security product segments, such as the high-growth mobile space, the company has struggled to compete against a myriad of upstarts. In mobile, for instance, Rodriguez said security technology from rivals Avast Software and Lookout Inc. is just as effective and often much cheaper, if not free.

'Bloated' Symantec facing deep-rooted issues Despite those obvious headwinds, a variety of experts told SearchSecurity that the root of Symantec's issues runs much deeper than Bennett, and that much more than a new CEO will be needed to steer the company in the right direction. Kevin McDonald, executive vice president for Irvine, Calif.-based managed IT services provider Alvaka Networks, said that the security industry has largely recognized that "Symantec was synonymous with bloated," from the company's software to its staff. While calling the decision to fire Bennett a "mind-blower," McDonald admitted the company may not have innovated enough to stave off emerging powerhouse rivals such as FireEye Inc. that are focused on detecting advanced attacks at the network level. Still, he predicted that the next Symantec CEO would benefit greatly from the moves that Bennett made. "I felt like there was finally stability in the company and they had somebody that knew how to look at the overall operation and make it work," McDonald said. "Bottom line is I felt like Bennett was paring back some of the bloat, and then expanding in the places he felt they needed to." John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the Bethesda, Md.-based SANS Institute and the former long-time lead security analyst for Gartner Inc., said that many of the issues Bennett faced during his tenure as Symantec CEO actually had much deeper roots, going back to John W. Thompson's leadership of the company from 1999 to 2009. Pescatore said Thompson set the tone for the company as it expanded into a variety of markets beyond information security. Pescatore noted that Microsoft's entry into the antivirus market threatened Symantec's core revenue stream. That trend continued under Bennett's predecessor, Enrique Salem, with the company soon providing everything from storage services to desktop management.###5373||iNVEZZ.com, Tuesday 18 March:

The ZEW German Economic Sentiment Index for March has checked in today at 46.6, missing by a country mile the market consensus for 52.8 and even more measurably below February’s 55.7. As well, ZEW’s Economic Sentiment Index for the Eurozone has dropped to 61.5 this month, falling short of expectations for a more modest decline to 67.3 from February’s 68.5.

Since the releases, the EUR/USD has dropped to as low as 1.3889, marginally above yesterday’s bottom at 1.3878.

Nordea Markets FX strategist Aurelija Augulyte believes that, contrary to common understanding, the best chance for the US dollar to strengthen against the euro is if the US economic data should continue to surprise to the downside.

“In normal times, the EURUSD will trend higher”, writes Augulyte. By ‘normal times’ she means a period when the US economy is growing and the country is spending more than it’s earning and running a current account deficit.

Augulyte emphasizes that “USD strengthening needs panic, recession, volatility”. In her view, the relatively low volatility since the start of 2014 coupled “with the hope that the US data weakness is temporary has brought the EURUSD up, almost to the projected level (1.3967)”.

The weakness of US data over the winter months has been partly weather-affected, “but to which extent, we will only find out in April/May”, notes the FX strategist. Should the data keep weakening in Q2, then the euro could take a sharper turn lower, but, Augulyte says, Nordea’s official view is that that is not likely to happen.

Augulyte’s baseline scenario is for the EUR/USD to experience “a temporary correction” to 1.365-1.37 before going back to 1.395 and ultimately above 1.40.

Right now, the currency pair is trading at around 1.3915, down 0.07 percent intraday.###5374||Empty###5375||Rosemary Okolie

Antivirus and security software heavyweight Symantec certainly caught the market off-guard yesterday (20th March). The company’s shares are feeling the heat today – down around 13% at time of writing.

The US-based company announced the termination of Steve Bennett as President and CEO.

At the same time, Symantec reiterated its fourth quarter revenue and profit guidance: it expects revenue of between $1.62bn and $1.66bn (versus $1.75bn the previous year).

Still, the move to fire Mr Bennett has created something of a stir given that he was just 20 months into the job of trying to restore the company to growth.

Competition is fierce

Prevalent cyber-attacks and security breaches and the resulting sustained emphasis on the need for security means that the market is seen as growing.

So it’s no surprise that competition is fierce among both existing players and relatively new entrants as they grapple to gain a larger share of the growing security market. Following underperformance, and in a bid to reposition competitively, Symantec embarked on a transformation plan, which included developing new competitive products and cutting costs.

But, over the last few quarters, declining sales and a plummeting share price (down some 32% from highs reached last summer) have plagued the company.

In light of Symantec’s recent performance, it’s perhaps fair to say that, despite turnaround efforts, the journey towards renewed growth seemed a tad protracted under Mr Bennett’s helm.

That said, given that the Norton antivirus maker sports a net cash position of around $1.8bn (as at December last year), it does have some financial flexibility to embark on further investments as it continues pursuing a turn around.

But shareholders’ patience might be running out…

According to the company’s interim CEO, Michael Brown, “the need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market”.

Indeed, that’s true but it was also just as true some two years ago.

The sell-off on the back this latest news might arguably be a tad dramatic but – until such a time as the company is seen by the market as executing its turnaround effectively (near-term’s doubtful) – the widespread downbeat sentiment is unlikely to improve significantly.###5376||PERTH, AUSTRALIA—Aircraft and ships from China headed to the desolate southern Indian Ocean to join the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, now lost for two full weeks, and Australia promised its best efforts to resolve “an extraordinary riddle.” A satellite spotted two large objects in the area earlier this week, raising hopes of finding the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board. Three Australian planes took off at dawn Saturday for a third day of scouring the region about 2,500 kilometres southwest of Perth.

Australian officials tried to tamp down expectations after a fruitless search Friday, even as they pledged to continue the effort. “It’s about the most inaccessible spot that you could imagine on the face of the Earth, but if there is anything down there, we will find it,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at a news conference in Papua New Guinea. “We owe it to the families and the friends and the loved ones of the almost 240 people on Flight MH370 to do everything we can to try to resolve what is as yet an extraordinary riddle,” he added.

Six aircraft were to search the region Saturday: two ultra long-range commercial jets and four P3 Orions, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. While the Orions are able to search for only two hours at a time, the commercial jets can stay in the search area for five hours before they must head back to the base. Two merchant ships were in the area, and the HMAS Success, a navy supply ship, was due to arrive late Saturday afternoon. Weather in the search zone was expected to be relatively good, with some cloud cover. Two Chinese aircraft are expected to arrive in Perth on Saturday to join the search, and two Japanese aircraft will arrive Sunday. A small flotilla of ships from China is still several days away. AMSA officials also were checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information.

Abbott spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing him as “devastated.” The passengers included 154 Chinese. In Kuala Lumpur, where the plane took off for Beijing, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein thanked the more than two dozen countries involved in the overall search that stretches from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

The search area indicated by the satellite images in the southern Indian Ocean is a four-hour round-trip flight from western Australia, leaving planes with only enough fuel to search for about two hours. The images were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them. Searchers on Friday relied mostly on trained spotters aboard the planes rather than radar, which found nothing Thursday, Australian officials said. The search will focus more on visual sightings because civilian aircraft are being brought in. The military planes will continue to use both radar and spotters. “Noting that we got no radar detections yesterday, we have replanned the search to be visual. So aircraft flying relatively low, very highly skilled and trained observers looking out of the aircraft windows and looking to see objects,” said John Young, manager of the maritime safety authority’s emergency response division. Malaysia asked the U.S. for undersea surveillance equipment to help in the search, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. There is a limited battery life for the beacons in the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders — about 30 days, said Chuck Schofield, vice-president of business development for Dukane Seacom Inc. The devices work to a depth of 6,100 metres, with a signal range of about two nautical miles, depending on variables like sea conditions. The signals are located using a device operated on the surface of the water or towed to a depth. Experts say it is impossible to tell if the grainy satellite images of the two objects — one 24 metreslong and the other measuring 5 metres — were debris from the plane. But officials have called this the best lead so far in the search that began March 8 after the plane vanished over the Gulf of Thailand on an overnight flight to Beijing. Aircraft pieces have sometimes been found floating for days after a sea crash. Peter Marosszeky, an aviation expert at the University of New South Wales, said the wing could remain buoyant for weeks if fuel tanks inside it were empty and had not filled with water. Other experts said that if the aircraft breaks into pieces, normally only items such as seats and luggage would remain floating. “We seldom see big metal (pieces) floating. You need a lot of (buoyant) material underneath the metal to keep it up,” said Lau Kin-tak, an expert in aircraft maintenance and accidents at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Shares of security software vendor Symantec (SYMC) have been halted pending a news announcement.

Update: The company has announced CEO Steve Bennett has been terminated, effective immediately, and that he is being replaced by board member Michael Brown, a veteran of Quantum, as interim CEO. Bennett also resigned from the board of directors.

Chairman Daniel Schulman remarked of Bennett,

We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.

The company re-affirmed a forecast for revenue this quarter of $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, and EPS of 40 cents to 42 cents, previously offered in late January.

Symantec stock is indicated by Nasdaq to resume trading at 4:20 pm, Eastern time.

Update: The stock has resumed trading and is down $2.03, or almost 10%, at $18.85.

Update 2: Symantec's most recent quarterly report was back on January 29th, at which time the company had beaten fiscal Q3 expectations, but offered a lower-than-expected Q1 revenue forecast.

The company has beaten revenue expectations six of the last eight quarters, and beaten EPS expectations 7 of those quarters, often by a wide margin, according to FactSet.

Bennett had been appointed CEO in July of 2012 after joining the board of directors in 2010. Prior to Symantec, he had been CEO at Intuit (INTU) for eight years, and had a long career at General Electric prior to that.

Shares have regained a little ground and are no down $1.25, or 6%, at $19.65.###5378||(Adds analysts’ comments, details; updates shares)

By Abhirup Roy

March 21 (Reuters) - Symantec Corp’s shares fell as much as 14 percent on Friday, a day after the security software maker fired its chief executive, raising concerns about its turnaround efforts.

At least five brokerages downgraded the stock, which has fallen nearly 17 percent in the past six months as the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, struggles with falling PC sales and a lackluster show on smartphone and tablets.

Steve Bennett, who took over as CEO in July 2012, had launched a strategic review of the business after replacing company veteran Enrique Salem, who was fired after three years on the job.

Since Bennett took over, the company’s shares had gained more than 40 percent to Thursday’s close.

“The first year was terrific, the last six months have been terrible,” MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez said.

“I think he got success with the low hanging fruit initially, but when he started to tackle the difficult challenge of changing the sales culture and reorganizing the sales organization ... that’s when the cookie crumbled,” Hernandez said.

Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz said morale had improved under Bennett.

Schwartz said Bennett’s exit, which follows several other departures over the past seven months, could hurt morale in Symantec.

He downgraded the company’s stock to “hold” from “buy” and cut his price target to $22 from $29. The company’s shares were down 12.7 percent at $18.25 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

Symantec’s chief financial officer of seven years, James Beer, resigned last September, while its president of products and services quit in November.

Chairman Daniel Schulman said the company was looking for a leader who would drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.

However, MKM’s Hernandez said it would be challenging for Symantec to get a new CEO as the market for talent had become competitive.

Analysts say Symantec has failed to evolve its antivirus and security products fast enough and keep pace with network security software makers such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks.

Network security software products are in demand as they analyse business networks and try to preempt cyber attacks, while antivirus software removes threats after computers have already been infected.

Research firm Gartner said in 2012 that the market for security software was expected to grow about 30 percent to $87 billion by 2016. (r.reuters.com/dyx77v)

Symantec has also struggled to gain a foothold in the fast growing mobile security software market, which is dominated by companies such as Lookout Inc, NQ Mobile Inc, Avast Software and Kaspersky.

Cowen and Co analyst Gregg Moskowitz said the departure of a cost-conscious CEO, combined with Symantec’s recent mis-execution and absence of continuity at the top, had reduced his confidence in the company’s ability to improve long-term operating margins.

Moskowitz downgraded the stock to “market perform” from “outperform.”

Mountain View, California-based Symantec appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO on Thursday.

Bennett may get as much as $18.5 million in severance payment, based on his employment agreement. His total compensation was $13 million for the fiscal year ended March 2013.

Problems for Symantec started in 2005 after it bought storage software maker Veritas in a $13.5 billion deal. Since then, Symantec has repeatedly disappointed Wall Street with weak numbers, mainly due to falling PC sales.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 27.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release its statement at 2 p.m. EDT, followed by Janet Yellen's first press conference as Fed chairwoman. The benchmark S&P 500 and the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) were up 0.01% and 0.09%, respectively, as of 10:20 a.m. EDT. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will be on investors' radar this morning after releasing disappointing fiscal second-quarter results yesterday afternoon -- shares are down 3% this morning.

The enterprise software giant missed Wall Street's expectations for adjusted earnings per share, revenue, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- a crude measure of cash flow). On EPS, this constitutes Oracle's third miss in the past five quarters; on revenue, it's four misses in five quarters; and on EBITDA, it's five misses in five quarters. But look at the magnitude of the latest misses: its largest, for EPS, was less than 3%; on revenue, the miss was less than half a percentage point.

There were more positive aspects to the results, too. Notably, revenue from hardware systems products rose 8% to $725 million -- the first such increase since Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 (although it's not clear that this is enough to justify the $5.6 billion purchase price). The growth in hardware revenue relates to the 30% growth (on a constant currency basis) in the engineered server systems business, which was one of the highlights of the quarter. As Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement:

Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have to.

Cloud software subscription revenue grew 25% in the quarter, with quarterly cloud application revenue now approaching $300 million. Large enterprise software vendors, including IBM and Microsoft, are now offering their products in the cloud -- software running on hosted hardware -- as corporate IT buyers shift toward this lower-maintenance format.

Oracle suffers from the curse of size, both in terms of its ability to be nimble and to grow its revenue base. Nevertheless, I continue to think the company is well positioned to serve its corporate customers. No one is reasonably expecting Oracle to generate massive growth at this stage, but at less than 12.5 times next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate, one can expect the shares to produce reasonable returns going forward, with good odds of outperforming the broad market.###5382||Empty###5383||The Norweigen merchant transport ship Hoegh St. Petersburg, which has been diverted to take part in the search for possible MH370 debris is seen from a Royal Australian Airforce AP-3C Orion from Pearce Airforce Base on March 21, 2014 in Perth, Australia.

Malaysia said Saturday that a Chinese satellite had spotted a large object along a broad stretch of ocean where officials hope to find a Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing for more than two weeks.

Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted an object 74 feet by 43 feet.

‘‘The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify,’’ he said.

State broadcaster CCTV tweeted an image of the object and said it was captured around noon Tuesday, about 75 miles south of another satellite image that was taken days earlier of two objects in the water.

Planes and ships have been searching the area of the earlier discovery for three days but have found nothing so far. Flight 370 went missing March 8 shortly after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

After about a week of confusion, authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777 for several hours after it disappeared from air traffic control screens indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia up to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Three Australian planes took off at dawn Saturday for a third day of scouring a desolate stretch of the southern Indian Ocean for possible parts of the missing plane.

Officials are still cautioning the search will be a protracted operation, with Minister Hussein saying searchers were facing a "long haul."

Efforts by more than two dozen countries have thus far failed to uncover conclusive evidence as to what happened to the jet, with the apparent slow progress leading to frustration and fresh questions. Searches on Friday proved fruitless, despite improved weather conditions from a day earlier.

Also on Friday, a purported transcript of the final conversations between the pilots of the plane and air traffic controllers was published by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. They appear to show the last 54 minutes of air-to-ground recordings for Flight 370.

The log ends with the words "All right, good night," believed to have been spoken by the missing plane's co-pilot before the cockpit's contact to air traffic control was severed.

A satellite spotted two large objects in the area earlier this week, raising hopes of finding the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Six aircraft and two merchant ships were scouring the area on Saturday, although Australian officials have cautioned the objects, one up to 72 feet in length, may not be related to the missing aircraft or might have sunk.

A small flotilla of ships from China is expected to arrive in the next few days.

Officials with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority were also checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information. The images that led to the focus on the southern Indian Ocean were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them.

Meanwhile, Malaysia has asked the U.S. for undersea surveillance equipment to help in the search, according to the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to assess the availability of the technology and its usefulness in the search, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said.

The Pentagon says it has spent $2.5 million to operate ships and aircraft in the search and has budgeted another $1.5 million for the efforts.###5384||Anti-virus software maker Symantec (SYMC) late Thursday fired CEO and President Steve Bennett, who had cut costs and was amid a major restructuring during his short tenure at the top.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.

Symantec stock was down 6.5% in after-hours trading, after the announcement. Symantec stock rose 1.6% in the regular session stock market today, closing at 20.91. The stock is down more than 25% since early August.

Director Michael Brown was appointed interim CEO while the company searches for a new leader. Brown joined Symantec's board in July 2005 and formerly served as CEO at Quantum.

Bennett joined Symantec as a board member in February 2010 and became chairman in August 2011. Bennett was named CEO and president in July 2012.

In January, when the company reported a third consecutive quarter of EPS growth acceleration, Bennett told analysts on a conference call that costs had come down because of "lower spending and increased organizational efficiency."

But sales fell 5% in fiscal Q3 ended Dec. 27, the second consecutive quarterly decline.

The company in January 2013 split the roles of CEO and chairman, electing board member Schulman to the latter position.

"Separating the positions of chairman and CEO allows me to focus on executing the company's strategic plan and managing the company's operations and performance," Bennett said in a statement at the time.

In an early February Q&A with IBD, Bennett was asked how things were going after most salespeople had been given new territory assignments.

"When you make that kind of big change, it creates some challenges, and we're still working through those," Bennett said then. "We'll be anxious to see how much progress we make in the fourth quarter. The pipeline looks solid."

Symantec is slated to report results for its fiscal Q4 ended on or near March 31 on May 7.

In answer to another question in the Q&A, Bennett was candid about the company's challenges, saying, "We're making the hard decision to position the company to win in the long term and taking a little short-term pain to reposition the company."

China's image, showing an object that appeared to be 72 feet 43 feet, was taken around noon Tuesday.

Australian officials said the location was within the 14,000-square-mile area they searched today, but the object was not found. An Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman she did not know whether the precise coordinates of the location had been searched, but added that coordinators will use the information to refine the search area. The authority, which is overseeing the search in the region, said a civil aircraft reported seeing a number of small objects in the search area, including a wooden pallet, but a New Zealand military plane diverted to the location found only clumps of seaweed. The agency said searchers would keep trying to determine whether the objects are related to the lost plane.###5388||BY JACOB RESNECK / GlobalPost

It's hard not to see this as having to do with the audio files Twitter users are passing around involving the prime minister and a corruption investigation.

ISTANBUL — Turkey has blocked Twitter hours after the prime minister vowed he’d “eradicate” the popular social media site.

A controversial new internet law passed last month allows the country’s telecommunications authority to order content removed within hours without a court order.

On Thursday night, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed Twitter wasn’t complying with the new law, and told a rally of thousands that he’d bring the site down.

The press advisory of the Prime Ministry later in the night clarified Erdogan's statement, arguing that Twitter officials currently "ignore" some court rulings in Turkey, which order the social media platform to "remove some links" as per the complaints filed by Turkish citizens.

"[In Erdogan's speech] it is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens," the statement said.

Reaction to the move — which came around midnight Friday local time — was swift. Major newspapers posted instructions offering simple technical workarounds to access the site.

“This is certainly a step backwards in terms of openness, transparency and the democratization process of Turkey,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Restrictions on political speech and discourse of this scale is unacceptable in any country including in Turkey.”

Twitter representatives confirmed reports that the site had been disrupted.

“We're looking into this now,” said Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler. The company’s official account offered Turkish cell phone subscribers ways to send tweets via text message.

The cause of the ban is most certainly political as Turkey prepares for March 30 local elections, seen as a key test of power for the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, now in its 11th year of rule.

Anonymous users have been posting links to YouTube of audio recordings purporting to be wiretaps that expose rampant corruption within Erdogan's inner circle.

This follows a corruption scandal that erupted Dec. 17 that implicated three cabinet ministers as well as businessmen with close ties to the prime minister’s closest associates.

The government has responded to the accusations with mass purges of the police and judiciary as well as by ordering evidence destroyed. Erdogan has said the accusations are part of a plot hatched by a former ideological ally, Fethullah Gulen — a Pennsylvania-based Islamic cleric — whom he accuses of conspiring to bring down his government.

“It was just a matter of moment for Prime Minister Erdogan and his men to decide to ban Twitter,” said Erkan Saka, an outspoken blogger and communications lecturer at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Twitter remains the main channel for freedom of expression and dissemination of corruption file leaks.”

Cyber law experts say the ban on Twitter is reminiscent of the YouTube ban that lasted for 18 months from 2008-2010.

“Certainly this is politically motivated just prior to the local elections,” Akdeniz said. “I suspect the decisions were issued prior to the PM's speech but they were only executed subsequent to his speech.”

Some of the alleged leaked wiretaps appeared to record Erdogan himself instructing media companies to censor coverage of last spring’s Gezi Park protests. Such censorship — during the protests CNN Türk famously showed a documentary on penguins in Antarctica in place of the news — is another reason why Twitter has been an important tool for Turkish citizens to share information, unrestricted, in real time. Several media companies during Erdogan’s tenure as prime minister have been fined or taken over by companies close to the government.

The recently passed internet law was panned by press freedom groups, including the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which warned it would have a chilling effect on free speech. The Turkish government claimed that the law was meant to protect children and the privacy of individuals.

Right now, the warnings from CPJ and other press freedom groups are looking prescient.

“CPJ urges the Turkish government to immediately unblock Twitter, and to respect the press freedom and free expression rights of its citizens,” said Geoffrey King, the group's internet advocacy coordinator, late Thursday.###5389||After ending the previous session nearly flat, treasuries moved modestly higher over the course of the trading day on Friday.

Bond prices crept steadily higher as the day progressed before moving roughly sideways going into the close. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.5 basis points to 2.75 percent.

The modest move to the upside by treasuries partly reflected easing concerns about the outlook for interest rates.

While worries that the Federal Reserve could raise rates sooner than anticipated contributed to a sharp drop by treasuries on Wednesday, traders seemed to realize that the guidance was not all the surprising.

In her post-meeting press conference, new Fed Chair Janet Yellen seemed to suggest that the central bank could begin raising rates by mid-2015.

The comments initially triggered fears across the , although analysts later noted that many economists have been offering the same forecast.

Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota released a statement this morning explaining his dissenting vote at the Fed meeting.

Kocherlakota said he wanted the Fed's statement to include language indicating that the central bank would keep rates at near-zero levels at least until the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent.

Traders also continued to digest the recent batch of U.S. economic data, which has generated optimism that the is poised to break out of the winter doldrums.

On Thursday, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected increase by its index of leading economic indicators, while a separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a significant turnaround in regional manufacturing activity.

Next week's trading could be impacted by more key economic data, including reports on new home sales, durable goods orders, and personal income and spending.

Bond traders are also likely to keep an eye on the results of the Treasury Department's auctions of two-year, five-year, and seven-year notes.

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit."

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."###5391||REUTERS: Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10% in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," the company said.

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5% organic growth and higher than 30% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5% revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5% decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company's sales team.

Symantec had been reorganising its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software-maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list," Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

###5392||New York, March 20, 2014--The Committee to Protect Journalists is deeply concerned about Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's threats today to close down Twitter. The threats come only days after he vowed to shut down Facebook and YouTube in Turkey.

"We call on Prime Minister Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society."

The prime minister made the threat to ban Twitter today in the western city of Bursa at a campaign rally for elections scheduled for March 30. Referring to an unspecified court order, the premier said, "We now have a court order. We'll eradicate Twitter. I don't care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic," the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported.###5393||Empty###5394||Empty###5395||MUNICH--German luxury car maker BMW AG gave a bullish outlook for profit and sales this year, but warned that its forecasts depend on political and economic stability.

Norbert Reithofer, chief executive officer of the Munich-based BMW automotive group, on Wednesday reaffirmed the company's target to sell more than two million cars for the first time this year. Boosted by higher car sales, Bayerische Motoren Werke's pretax earnings should show "clear growth" in 2014, he said.

Mr. Reithofer's upbeat outlook contained a considerable caveat in light of the continuing political uncertainty in Europe over Russia's planned annexation of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine and Europe's still weak economic recovery. Car sales in the European Union have risen nearly 7% so far this year, but industry executives remain cautious in their outlook for the full year.

"Just like you, we are monitoring the political and economic developments in the world," Mr. Reithofer said in a prepared speech. "Everything is fragile. Things could change at any moment."

As previously reported, BMW sold 1.96 million cars world-wide last year, an increase of 6.4%, and achieved sales of EUR76 billion, down 1% from a year earlier. BMW's net profit rose 4.5% to EUR5.34 billion last year, a record high for the automotive group.

Much of BMW's growth is coming from China and the U.S.

In 2013, BMW built 300,000 cars in its Spartenburg, South Carolina plant. With demand increasing, Mr. Reithofer reiterated that BMW is considering expanding capacity at the plant. No decision has been made.

In China, BMW expanded capacity to 300,000 cars a year last year and is already making preparations to expand further to 400,000. The German car group will also build a new engine plant with its joint venture partner Brilliance. The plant is expected to open in 2016.

Visa and Mastercard stock movements

The stock price of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) traded in the range opened at $223.17 per share and then it fluctuated from $219.70 to $232.6 per share and eventually closed at $223.37, up by 0.70%.

On the other hand, the equities of Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) opened at $79.34 per share. The stock traded from $79.50 per share to $79.83 a share and eventually closed at $75.99 per share, down by 3.09%.

Court of Appeals ruling on Debit Card Swipe Fees

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated that the Federal Reserve ensure that interchange fees reflect the actual cost of processing debit cards transactions. In order to comply with the law, the Federal Reserve initially proposed limiting the fees to $0.12 per debit card transaction, but finally set it to $0.21 per swipe with the possibility of a few cents increase to cover some costs such as fraud. Prior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.

Several retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) among others filed a case requesting a federal judge to nullify the ruling of the Federal Reserve. Last year, a District Court Judge in Washington tossed the Federal Reserve rule and cited that it misinterpreted the Dodd-Frank law. District Court Judge Richard Leon opined that the Fed rule “utterly indefensible” interpretation and “runs completely afoul of the text, design and purpose” of the Dodd-Frank law.

Today, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees. However, the court noted that the Dodd-Frank amendment was written poorly and a clarification is necessary to determine the appropriate cap for debit card transaction fees. The Court of Appeal said, “Its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”

Analysts’ comments

In a note to investors, Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies believed that the ruling of the Court of Appeals is positive for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) as it eliminates concerns regarding its superior U.S. signature debit market share being eroded by increased competition, which should have been the case if the fed lost the exclusivity part of the appeal.

Kupferberg believe that the ruling will “likely be an incremental positive” for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and it “would reduce potential risks of further downward pressure on debit network fees paid by issuers.”

On the other hand, analysts at JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) opined that the ruling was a “big win” for the payments industry particularly for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) because it can keep its 70% share in the signature debit card market.###5397||The bike share is focused on increasing the number of weekly and daily users. Currently, weekly memberships are available for $25 and daily memberships are available for $9.95.

“It’s already kind of expensive as it is,” Todd Graham of Park Slope told CBS 2’s Janelle Burrell.

“I wouldn’t be surprised. $95 is not a lot of money for a bike to use all year long around the city whenever you want,” an annual member told Haskell. “Ninety-five dollars a year beats a MetroCard every month.”

Citi Bike Remains In The Red, Looks To Boost Daily, Weekly Ridership

The program currently currently has 99,000 annual members and an average daily ridership of more than 36,000 trips during the summer and fall.

But ridership took a worse-than-expected hit this winter, Burrell reported.

Operators are looking for more sponsors to provide a financial cushion. Citi Bike is looking at ways to attract more short-term users and expand into new neighborhoods.

According to reports, some Citi Bike workers have been laid off and there have also been operational problems.

Earlier this month, the New York City DOT Commissioner said all options are on the table when asked about a fee increase.

“A lot of people wont renew,” Kenneth Podziba, president and CEO of non-profit advocacy group Bike New York, told Burrell. “It’s just not working for tourists and I think people didn’t anticipate that when they made their projections.”

In other major cities like Chicago and Boston, where the bike-share programs are very successful, their annual membership is actually slightly less than what’s charged in New York. However, those bike-share programs are subsidized.

“There’s no public money. How else will it survive? You can’t rely on sponsors like Citibank and MasterCard to be there every year,” Podziba said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday cautioned the city is not in a position to bail out the bike-share program financially.

“Our transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, is gonna work with Citi Bike looking for ways that we can be in collaboration with them, find ways to make their operation more efficient, more effective,” said the mayor. “Our goal is to expand it farther out into the city and to the outer boroughs.”

Trottenberg added Friday that it’s her goal to get the service on sound financial and operational footing.

There are 6,000 Citi Bikes docked at 330 stations across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bike share program launched last May.

From the Associated Press:

The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.

The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker’s disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.

“Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues … Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress,” Holder told a news conference.

Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, “we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust,” said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. “In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first.”

Toyota said it had “made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totaling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.

###5399||Empty###5400||A major change has happened at the top of security firm Symantec, with CEO Steve Bennett being sacked, replaced by Michael Brown who will be an interim CEO while the search for a new chief exec takes place.

Bennett hadn't yet made the two year mark in the role, but clearly, things weren't turning out as the board expected. Symantec didn't give a clear explanation as to exactly why they had parted ways with Bennett – but it did at least say that it wasn't due to any massive faux pas on his behalf.

Chairman of the board Daniel Schulman said: "This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

He also said: "We recognise Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future."

Michael Brown, the chap now temporarily in charge, joined Symantec's board in 2005, and was previously CEO of Quantum Corporation, which doubled its revenue under his stewardship.

Brown said: "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan."###5401||Empty###5402||Why did this happen?

MONTPELIER (AP) - The Vermont Department of Labor says the state's unemployment rate for January was 4 percent, a drop of two-tenths of one percent from December.

The Vermont rate, the fourth consecutive reported monthly decrease for the state, compares to a national unemployment rate of 6.6 percent for January.

Unemployment in Vermont's 17 labor markets ranged from a low of 2.5 percent in Warren-Waitsfield to a high of 7 percent in the Newport area.

Employment sectors that had significant job growth last month include state government, which added about 1,400 jobs, and professional and business services, 700 jobs.

The most significant declines came from construction, which dropped 800 jobs.###5407||Empty###5408||Empty###5409||Dollar remains lower against yen

Investing.com - The dollar pulled away from session lows against the yen on Tuesday as investor sentiment improved following a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but mixed U.S. data on housing and inflation continued to weigh.

was last down 0.18% to 101.57, having reached intra-day highs of 101.77 as President Putin spoke. The pair fell to lows of 101.32 earlier in the session.

The pair was likely to find support at 101.19, last Friday’s low and a five-week low and resistance at 101.93, the session high.

Market sentiment recovered after President Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The speech came one day after the Russian president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

But the dollar remained under pressure after data showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But, U.S. housing starts fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Elsewhere, the euro remained slightly lower against the dollar, with slipping 0.13% to 1.3903.

The euro slid earlier after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

The report indicated that the economic upswing in Germany is not at risk. The assessment of current economic conditions improved to 51.3 this month from 50.0 in February.###5410||Twitter takes action and hires lawyer against Turkish ban

Shares of GameStop plunged 5% in morning trading on Tuesday after Wal-Mart announced it was entering a prime space for the video game chain: used games.

Wal-Mart unveiled its new used games service, which will allow consumers to trade in older video games and apply it to any item purchased at Wal-Mart or Sam's Club. The program kicks off March 26.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart, in a blog post.

The used games industry has been dominated by GameStop, which makes a healthy chunk of its revenue off trade-ins. Wal-Mart isn't the only retailer to wade into the used games market. Both Amazon and Best Buy host similar services.

Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia estimates 43% of Gamestop's gross profit dollars come from their used games business.

Meanwhile, Microsoft stock is up 4.2% following reports the company plans on making its Office software available for Apple's iPad.

According to The Verge, Microsoft plans to host an event next week where it will unveil a version of its suite of Office apps for the Apple tablet. The report says the interface and features will be similar to the Office app for iPhone.

Also, Hewlett-Packard shares are up nearly 2% after Barclay's upgraded the personal computer maker's stock to "overweight." As CNBC reports, Barclay's thinks HP can improve how it implements its tech services and gain share in its x86 enterprise server business.

Symantec's (SYMC) board announced that company director Michael Brown will replace Bennett on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is hired.

The maker of Norton antivirus software and corporate cybersecurity systems has been struggling with disappointing financial results, and it is in the process of reorganizing its business. Symantec said in January 2013 that it planned to refresh its product offerings with a focus on integrating its services across devices.

The company employs more than 20,000 people, and says 99% of Fortune 500 firms are Symantec customers.

Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said the company was working to find a CEO who could "drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

Schulman praised Bennett's progress in reorganizing the company and reducing costs, adding that his firing was "not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Bennett had been at the helm of Symantec since July 2012. He was previously a member of the company's board, and served as president and CEO at financial software company Intuit (INTU) from 2000 to 2007.###5422||Empty###5423||Empty###5424||WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached a $1 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp over the automaker's handling of consumer complaints tied to unintended vehicle acceleration and is set to announce the agreement as early as Wednesday, CNN reported.

Sources familiar with the deal told CNN that Toyota was expected to avoid criminal charges.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan has been probing allegations the Japanese company misled U.S. authorities after the complaints about the unintended acceleration emerged. The acceleration issue prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles beginning in 2009.

"Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," a Toyota spokeswoman told CNN. "During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Officials at the U.S. Attorney General's Office could not immediately be reached for comment.

The automaker last year paid more than $1 billion to resolve economic-loss claims related to the recall.

(Reporting by Peter Cooney; Editing by Eric Walsh)###5425||Investing.com - The pound on Tuesday slipped against the dollar, which saw relief demand after Russian President Vladimir Putin assured the world he has no plans to annex Ukraine.

In U.S. trading on Tuesday, was trading at 1.6584, down 0.32%, up from a session low of 1.6546 and off a high of 1.6647.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6383, the low from Feb. 10, and resistance at 1.6666, Monday's high.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine," signaling that Russia's moves in the area would be limited.

The speech came one day after President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters opting to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy, which came at the pound's expense.

Trading was somewhat edgy, as CNN reported that Ukraine Defense Ministry Spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Elsewhere, mixed U.S. housing and consumer inflation data watered down the dollar's gains against the pound albeit slightly.

The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.

The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase..

U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Sterling was down against the euro, with up 0.33% at 0.8396, and down against the yen, with down 0.58% at 168.31.

On Wednesday, markets will pay close attention to the Federal Reserve.

The U.S. central bank is to announce its decision on interest rates and monetary policy followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen, her first as head of the monetary authority.###5426||Symantec Corp. Thursday fired its CEO, Steve Bennett, after less than two years on the job.

In-depth analysis News Writer Brandan Blevins reports that experts say Symantec's strategic problems root deeper than just its CEO.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based security vendor has appointed Michael Brown, a member of its board of directors, as its interim president and CEO. Bennett also stepped down from Symantec's board of directors.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future," said Symantec board chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement.

In searching for its next CEO, Schulman said the company's priority is to identify a leader who can leverage Symantec's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.

Bennett assumed the top job at Symantec in July 2012, shortly after the company's board removed its previous CEO, Enrique Salem.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process," said Schulman, "and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Just last week in an interview with CRN, Bennett detailed his plans for growing Big Yellow's market share in key information security product segments, emphasizing the so-called "Symantec 4.0" strategy that included new road maps for its information security, information management and mobility product lines.

However, many have questioned Symantec's strategy in recent years as enterprises have shifted away from endpoint security products, Symantec's core market, instead favoring a mix of emerging network security products.

The company is also facing a Justice Department investigation regarding whether its sales practices violated the U.S. False Claims Act. Symantec said efforts related to the investigation are likely to cost the company close to $150 million.

Symantec said it is convening a special committee of its board of directors to begin an immediate search for a permanent CEO, with assistance from an executive search firm.###5427||Submit

The review, which was initiated by the FAA after a battery fire aboard a 787 in Boston in January 2013, encompassed the entire plane, not specifically the battery issue.

It made seven recommendations for further improvements in Boeing processes and the agency's oversight, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said.

The Boston fire and another battery incident in Japan several days later prompted regulators to ground the plane for three-and-a-half months last year. The plane has also suffered a series of mishaps with brakes, fuel lines, electrical panels, hydraulics and other systems.

Boeing redesigned the battery, charger and containment system to ensure battery fires would not put the plane at risk, and the Dreamliner was returned to service. The cause of the battery problems has not been determined and is the subject of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation.###5430||Iowa’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January edged up to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent in December

Not wanting to let other retailers like GameStop, Best Buy, and Amazon have all the fun, Walmart has decided to enter the $2 billion pre-owned video game business.

Walmart will allow for trade-ins to Walmart employees starting today, with official trade-ins to customers beginning on March 26th at over 3,100 stores. Then, in the Summer, Walmart will be reselling the used games in stores and online, calling them “Certified Pre-Owned”.

Walmart made sure to note that “new releases will still remain the focus of our business,” but when it comes to trading in games for a Walmart gift card (which can be used to buy anything in stores and online), their strategy is “to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want.” They also added, “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins.”

Oracle reported per-share earnings of 68 cents on revenue of $9.3 billion. That compares with the 70 cents on $9.4 billion that analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had predicted.

Oracle shares rose 62 cents, or 1.65 percent, during the regular session, and closed at $38.22 a share. The shares have risen by about 28 percent since hitting a recent low in June.

New software licenses rose by four percent. Hardware sales rose by eight percent. Software license updates and product support revenues rose five percent to $4.6 billion.

Oracle said it expects to report earnings of 92 to 99 cents a share in Q4, which is more or less in line with the consensus view of 96 cents. It says it expects overall sales to grow between three and seven percent, but that’s assuming the currency environment stays where it is today, which it won’t.

Speaking of currencies, Oracle took a hit on revenue growth thanks — or no thanks — to the stronger US dollar. After backing out the effect of currencies, Oracle said its sales would have grown by 10 percent, not four percent and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis would have grown by seven percent instead of five percent.

In a statement, Oracle President Mark Hurd said bookings for cloud applications rose by 60 percent and are now on a run-rate to $300 million per quarter. On a conference call with analysts, Hurd called it the “best quarter ever,” for Oracle’s cloud business.

On the call CEO Larry Ellison talked about an up-and-coming cloud infrastructure business that will compete with Amazon Web Services and IBM Softlayer. Ellison said the service will be priced competitively with AWS. He went on to say Oracle sees it as a commodity business and that’s in his words, “not a bad thing.”

While Amazon is still the king in terms of raw computing capacity and while IBM has argued — not persuasively — that it’s the biggest cloud company by revenue Oracle will try to flood the zone and take some business away from both of them.###5438||Empty###5439||The software driving Bitcoin's network was upgraded Wednesday, with security fixes addressing a problem that defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox blamed for losing nearly half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins.

The open-source software, known as Bitcoin-QT, has also been rebranded as "Bitcoin Core" to highlight that it runs the core infrastructure of the virtual currency's transaction and verification network.

Upgrading Bitcoin's software is a delicate operation, and many of the changes have been under discussion for months. The market capitalization of all bitcoins in circulation is roughly US$8 billion, according to figures from Blockchain.info, and a mistake could be costly.

But the virtual currency has weathered innumerable negative events over the past five years and is still seeing growing adoption by businesses and retailers as an alternative payment platform.

The value of a bitcoin wobbled only slightly after Mt. Gox, at one time the largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28 and in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas on March 9.

In early February, Mt. Gox said it was investigating a long-known security problem called "transaction malleability," which in some cases can allow attackers to make it falsely appear they haven't received a bitcoin payment if an exchange isn't properly validating transactions.

Other exchanges briefly halted trading while inspecting their code, but bitcoin experts said highly customized software written by Mt. Gox likely exacerbated the problem.

After filing for bankruptcy, Mt.Gox said the bug was possibly responsible for the missing bitcoins, valued at US$474 million at the time. It has not yet provided a clearer explanation for the losses.

The latest version of bitcoin's software, 0.9.0, contains more than a half dozen fixes for transaction malleability, according to the release notes for the software.

Bitcoin Core also contains a new feature for payment requests. Previously, merchants couldn't attach a note describing an invoice, and people also could not supply a refund address to a merchant.

The latest version automatically supplies a refund address. The payment requests can also be cryptographically signed to ensure the bitcoins are going to the intended recipient, wrote Wladimir van der Laan of the Bitcoin Core Development Team.

The improvements help make bitcoin more usable for commerce. Lann wrote that future Bitcoin Core releases will aim to fine tune the software, improving its functionality and the users' experiences.

Developers creating bitcoin-compatible software are advised to incorporate the software changes into their own "wallets," which are software programs for holding and transferring bitcoins, and other payments applications.

The service will begin starting March 26, according to Reuters.

The service means Walmart will accept games for a number of consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360.

Customers who take part in a trade in will receive store credit, but not cash, at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online, the company said, according to Reuters.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement, according to Reuters.

Other retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, and Target also offer trade-in programs for used videogames as well.

All traded-in videogames will be refurbished before being made available for purchase to buyers, according to Walmart.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," said Naughton.###5442||###5443||Empty###5444||NEW YORK/ZURICH: Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay $885 million to resolve claims by a U.S. regulator that the Swiss bank misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.

The settlement announced on Friday would resolve claims in two lawsuits filed in New York by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies.

It is the ninth settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011, when it filed 18 lawsuits over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

The accord resolves claims pending in New York federal court against Credit Suisse over $16.6 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and ends what the Swiss bank called the largest mortgage-related investor litigation it still faced.

Credit Suisse will pay $234 million to Fannie Mae and $651 million to Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.

So far, the FHFA has recovered more than $10.1 billion from banks over similar securities.

This includes nearly $9.8 billion in settlements of litigation with such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The FHFA also reached a separate $335.2 million accord with Wells Fargo & Co, which it did not formally sue.

Many of the settlements were reached after a series of series of court rulings that went against the banks.

Lawsuits remain pending against several other banks, including Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

Credit Suisse said on Friday it will reduce previously reported fourth-quarter and 2013 results by 275 million Swiss francs ($311.17 million) after taxes for the settlement, resulting in a fourth-quarter net loss of 8 million Swiss francs.

While Credit Suisse said the settlement resolves the biggest mortgage case it faced, the bank still must deal with other mortgage cases in the United States, including ones by the National Credit Union Administration and attorneys general in New York and New Jersey.

Credit Suisse is also one of 14 Swiss banks targeted by U.S. prosecutors for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank has said it is trying to settle that matter.

Last month, the Zurich-based bank agreed to pay $196.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it provided unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients.

The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06200.###5445||BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- After more than a year of planning and intense media curiosity, the Walmart to Go convenience store "quietly" opened in Bentonville, Ark., on March 15, with the grand opening set for March 19, reported The City Wire. It is Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s new effort to capture a different and growing element of the retail market.

The newspaper described the small store is a "hybrid format--part traditional convenience store, part grocery, part quick-serve restaurant." The site also features six canopied gasoline dispensers.

Walmart partnered with Bentonville Butcher & Deli to operate a deli counter in the back of the store. There are soda and frozen drink fountains, milk shakes and full coffee bar.

Refrigerated food-to-go includes market fresh pizzas, sandwiches and other meat entrees. There is also fresh fruit and a Greek yogurt smoothie station.

The store offers beer and wine in a walk-in cooler, as well as frozen food.

The small grocery component includes five aisles with hundreds of packaged foods and nonfood items from breakfast cereals to dog food and diapers. Shirley's Flowers has a fresh flowers kiosk near the front doors next to the Hallmark Cards. The store also has Krispy Kreme doughnuts, magazines, books and an ATM, as well as interior and exterior seating areas.

The center of the store closely resembles a traditional c-store with cashiers in a corral with a wide range of tobacco products.

The retailer is testing an online grocery delivery service with a similar name, WalmartToGo.com, said a report by Arkansas Business. Wal-Mart spokesperson Deisha Barnett told the newspaper that the Walmart to Go c-store is a "one-off project."

"It's a convenience store test concept," she said. "We're not planning any more across the country."

Walmart currently operates 20 small-format Walmart Express stores, approximately 15,000 square feet in size. The units have performed well, it said, and the company is expanding them beyond the initial three-market pilot. The company also is testing several 2,500-square-foot, college-based convenience store-type retail outlets called Walmart on Campus.

Bill Simon, Walmart U.S. president and CEO recently said that its "small-store expansion … including fresh, pharmacy and fuel, will help us usher in the next generation of retail." In what industry observers have pegged as a strategy to quell competition from the dollar-store channel, Wal-Mart has announced that it is significantly accelerating its capital plan for U.S. small-store format openings for the current fiscal year.

Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores has 10,942 stores under 71 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 10 countries, with fiscal-year 2014 sales of more than $473 billion.###5446||Text size

NEW YORK >> Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The worlds largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sams Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

Gaming continues to be an important business for us and were actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity, said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.###5448||New York, March 20, 2014--The Committee to Protect Journalists is deeply concerned about Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's threats today to close down Twitter. The threats come only days after he vowed to shut down Facebook and YouTube in Turkey.

"We call on Prime Minister Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society."

The prime minister made the threat to ban Twitter today in the western city of Bursa at a campaign rally for elections scheduled for March 30. Referring to an unspecified court order, the premier said, "We now have a court order. We'll eradicate Twitter. I don't care what the international community says.

It’s not just the federal government that will scrutinze Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner. The states are coming, too.

Reuters reports:

Florida and other U.S. states will join the Justice Department in seeking to determine if Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable is legal under U.S. antitrust law, Florida said in a statement to Reuters. “We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ (Justice Department) Antitrust Division,” the Florida state attorney general’s office said in an emailed statement. The attorneys general group is focused on broadband rather than cable in assessing the $45.2 billion deal, according to a source familiar with the effort who was not authorized to speak on the record.

It’s in the broadband business that Comcast would actually seem to be in less danger of generating monopoly concerns — in Philadelphia alone, after all, the company has broadband competition from Verizon FIOS and RCN. In cable, meanwhile, a single company is usually regionally dominant. Still, we’ll keep an eye on what the states are doing.

(Business Wire)###5450||A BRAND new design for the £1 coin has been unveiled by the Treasury, as the current shape is set to be scrapped by 2017.

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

According to the Department of Workforce Development in a report issued Monday, Indiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points, to 6.4 percent, in January. That is lower than all neighboring states and 0.2 percentage points below the national average.



“Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today’s unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a prepared statement. “Indiana’s rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow.”



The Hoosier state added 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector in January, the most in the country. But Indiana also lost 7,100 private sector jobs, leaving the state at a net loss of 2,500 jobs for the month.



“While others may gush about ‘the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,’ I look at the report and find myself wondering many things,” Pelath said.



He noted all but one of the state’s metropolitan statistical areas – and 82 of the 92 counties – actually saw unemployment rise in January.



“These disparities only serve to heighten the concern that many of us have about the so-called ‘job creation’ engine that the governor, his administration, and his super-majorities like to tout so often,” Pelath said.



But Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center, said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the recent administration’s job-creation strategies.



He said the Hoosier economy is closely tied to the national economy so these numbers may be result of the general economic upswing throughout the country.



But Conover also said Indiana has a “well-deserved” reputation as a business-friendly state. The legislature recently passed a bill that will give Indiana the lowest corporate tax rate in the country.



The lowering of the business personal property tax was one of the landmark items of the Pence agenda.



“With this legislative session’s accomplishments in cutting the corporate income tax rate, giving counties new tools for reforming the business personal property tax, and offering new opportunities for career education and retraining, we continue to work hard to ensure the future economic prosperity of our state,” Pence said.



The DWD – along with the U.S. Federal Reserve – cited January’s severe winter weather as one of the main reasons for a loss of jobs around the country.



Conover agreed with the assessment and noted that more than 9,000 jobs were lost in the areas of trade, transportation and utilities, and construction alone.



But that explanation was not enough for Pelath.



“People can talk about seasonal adjustments all they want, but I continue to be concerned about the raw employment and unemployment numbers,” he said. “Those tell me who has a job and who is able to take care of their family.”



Pence agreed that there is still more work to be done.



“Amidst this good news, we know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy,” he said. “Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve Indiana’s economic climate, to attract more jobs, and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future."###5456||× Walmart now accepting used video games as trade for gift cards

NEW YORK – Walmart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept an unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age.

Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted.

The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, Duncan Mac Naughton said, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade-in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives.

Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.###5457||Empty###5458||Close Get email notifications on Mika Highsmith daily!

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from U.S. lawmakers on Friday, after U.S. health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was "pleased to have finalized an agreement" for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

"We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C," Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with U.S.-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead's offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world's highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie , Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment - and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.

BMW is targeting a significant improvement in 2014 sales volume, that would take the company to a new all-time high of more than 2.0 million vehicles. The pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses, the company said.

In spite of substantial levels of investment in new technologies, the Automotive division would again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8% - 10%. The Motorcycles segment sales are forecast to be slightly up over last year, not least due to the contribution expected from the new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs. In 2014, the Financial Services segment is likely to also remain on growth course.

The current year forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

At the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2014, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board would propose to shareholders that the dividend be increased to a new highest level of 2.60 euros per common share and 2.62 euros per preferred share.

eBay and Icahn

We expect activist investor Icahn to propose his detailed reasoning for the spin-off of PayPal shortly. We believe Mr. Icahn will present his argument ahead of the shareholder meeting scheduled for early May.

We expect the following points to be made (with our quick thoughts):

1. PayPal will likely benefit from the power of focus. We believe PayPal is already the focus of all of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and most of its investments.

2. PayPal would be a more attractive employer. PayPal’s retention of acquired executives and longstanding reputation in Silicon Valley is already very attractive.

3. PayPal will be able to form relationships it is currently limited from forming. While we believe Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and/or Alibaba are unlikely to ever accept PayPal, we do think this is a key argument. In fact, we believe that if PayPal was independent AXP, MA and V may clamor to own the one and only property that gives a concentrated presence in the fastest growing segment of commerce, 143 million consumers and millions of merchant relationships.

Items in ebay’s favor

We believe that the current debate may encourage management to tilt the balance more towards delivering strong 2014 results, given the inverse relationship between support for spin-off and the share price.

Stable ecommerce, retail and currency should make upside easier to achieve (pages 2-4). Recent US data from comScore has shown improving trends in February and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s currency basket has recently been working in its favor.

Reiterate OUTPERFORM and price target of $70. Our price target represents a 20x P/FE multiple our 2015 estimate, a 10% discount to V and MA, the closest comparables, based on the size of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s opportunity, somewhat offset by management’s caution for 2014.###5477||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

For the second time in less than two years, Symantec Corp. has a new chief executive officer.

In a that surprised observers, the Mountain View, Calif-based security and storage vendor Thursday fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named board member Michael Brown as his interim replacement.

In a statement, Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said Bennett's organizational realignment and cost cutting efforts have positioned the company for future growth.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth," Schulman said.

The decision to terminate Bennett "was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," he added.

Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as Symantec CEO in July 2012. He was president and CEO of Intuit between 2000 and 2007 and joined Symantec's board in 2010.

In the 20 months or so that he was at the helm, Bennett did a decent job of managing the company, said Gene Ruth, lead Symantec analyst at Gartner.

"Bennett brought business acumen to Symantec," Ruth said. "He was a business architect type of person. My observation was that he was rearranging the organization and repositioning it," by bringing in new people and refreshing the company culture. "He was redirecting them to be more focused on delivering products that customers really wanted."

Some of the changes being implemented by Bennett required time to take hold, time he wasn't given. It doesn't happen in a month. But it looks like the board was not patient." Ruth said.

As recently as November, Gartner gave Symantec a positive rating for its efforts, Ruth noted. The chief criticisms at that time were that Symantec had to better realign its sales force and address some support issues related to one of its core data backup products.

"In general they were holding their own. It wasn't like they were grabbing a lot of market share, [but] it wasn't like they were losing market share." Clearly for Symantec's board though, maintaining market share does not appear to have been enough, Ruth said.

Newly named interim CEO Brown has been on Symantec's board of directors since the company acquired Veritas Software in July 2005. Brown sat on the Veritas board.

He was previously chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

Symantec today said the move won't impact its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The company still expects revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion, down from $1.74 billion in the same period last year, Symantec noted.

GameStop GME, -2.49% shares dropped 3.1%. The move came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.35% said it would allow customers to hand in used videogames in exchange for gift cards, which can be used in its retail stores or online. The change in policy from Wal-Mart Stores could eat away at GameStop’s dominance of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S. Wal-Mart shares are up marginally.

Microsoft MSFT, +0.39% shares rose 4.3%. Analysts at Barclays hiked the stock’s price target to $44 from $43. “Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365. It can drive better earnings growth as it transitions its ubiquitous on-premise install bases (Office and Windows Server) to its cloud platforms,” analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a report. Barclays rates the stock at overweight.

Decliners

Bloomberg GameStop shares are sliding.

NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +1.14% shares fell 3.1%. The exchange operator will host an investor’s day on March 27. Analysts from Jefferies who recently met with Nasdaq executives said the management is upbeat about Nasdaq OMX NLX, its derivatives platform.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. KORS, -3.47% slid 2.2%. Analysts at Barclays initiated coverage of the U.S. luxury sector with a positive industry outlook but Michael Kors was issued an underweight rating.

Gainers

Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ, +0.17% shares added 3.7%. The stock’s rating was raised to overweight from equalweight and its price target hiked to $38 versus $33 at Barclays on Tuesday.

SanDisk Corp. US:SNDK shares gained 4.4%. The stock will be added to the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index on March 24. The index is composed of 100 tech and telecommunications companies that regularly pay a dividend.

Shares of United States Steel Corp. X, -0.91% rose 5.3%. Analysts at Nomura lowered U.S. Steel’s first-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to 35 cents from 40 cents. The stock is rated a buy with a target price of $32. The stock is down 14% year to date.

Tickers to Watch

TSLA: Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, -2.33% rose 2.3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the stock’s six-month price target to $200, which is still below its current trading level of $239.

MSG: Madison Square Garden Co. MSG, +0.56% shares are up 0.8%. The entertainment company said Tuesday that it named Phil Jackson, one of the successful coaches in the NBA history, as president of the New York Knicks. Jackson won two championships as a player with the Knicks in 1970 and 1973. He also coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles and the Los Angeles Lakers to five titles.

HTZ: Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, +1.56% shares edged up 0.1%. The company said Tuesday it received board approval to proceed with a spinoff of its equipment-rental business that is expected to close by early next year. The new company will be called HERC, the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, while Hertz will retain the rental-car businesses. Hertz said it will receive about $2.5 billion in proceeds from the spinoff that will be used to pay down debt and fund a new $1 billion stock buyback program.

At the same time, Hertz said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed as revenue rose to $2.56 billion, with its adjusted per-share earnings coming in at 26 cents. But results fell short of analyst expectations compiled by FactSet.

THC: Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, -2.17% rose 1.6%. Analysts at Mizuho said they would be buyers of hospital stocks like Tenet due to the sector’s recent weakness on changes related to individual mandate exemption rules and earnings. “We do not think either issue will have a meaningful negative impact on our EPS estimates for the hospital group,” the analysts said in a note. Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, -0.66% climbed 3.4% and HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -1.84% advanced 2.2%.

The funds have been declared to the courts where the company has filed for bankruptcy protection, but will not be enough to save it.

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in its native Japan after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around £210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole. It has since taken the same action through the US courts.

Following the debacle, CEO Mark Karpeles's personal blog and Reddit account were hacked, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.

MtGox's opponents have criticised its latest move, describing its bankruptcy protection filing in the US as a "ruse" in an attempt to divert attention from instances of "massive fraud".

MtGox was the world's largest Bitcoin exchange and its recent troubles have seen the virtual currency's value take a dip, with one unit worth around half the price it reached in November 2013.###5489||Empty###5490||Thank you for Reading.

Visa and MasterCard have blocked credit card services to some Russian bank customers as a result of US sanctions.

Four banks are so far affected, all of which have links to Russians blacklisted by the US.

Visa and MasterCard, both US-based companies, are forbidden from having any dealings with those targeted by the sanctions.

The banks, which said card services stopped without warning, have described the move as unlawful.

'Frozen out'

One of the banks affected, Bank Rossiya, is described by the US as Russia's 15th largest, with assets of $12bn (£7.27bn).

The St Petersburg-based bank has been singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials. US officials said it would be "frozen out" from the dollar.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bank Rossiya had nothing to do with events in Crimea and promised to transfer his wages there.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to protect Bank Rossiya

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

President Putin also instructed the Russian central bank to step in, if needed, but the latter said the sanctions on Bank Rossiya did "not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability".

'Illegitimate'

Visa and Mastercard also confirmed they had stopped providing services to SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday. Vladimir Putin, Russian President

The bank, which is Russia's 39th biggest with $5bn in assets, called the actions "illegitimate" because its owners, rather than the bank itself, were the subject of sanctions.

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

But Visa said more than 99% of its business in Russia was untouched by sanctions.

Russian shares fell sharply on Friday as investors weighed the impact of western sanctions over Ukraine.

The MICEX index, which is priced in roubles, fell as much as 3% and the RTS, which is priced in dollars fell 3.6%.

Stocks slumped after US President Barack Obama said sanctions might be extended to key parts of the Russian economy if Russia took further action in Ukraine.

Share falls

Russia's mining, defence and natural resources sectors could all be targets.

Stocks recovered some ground during the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to restore calm following the introduction of asset freezes and visa bans by the US against high ranking Russian officials.

The MICEX closed down 1% and the RTS index was down 1.3% at the end of the day.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Allies of the Russian president targeted by US sanctions include railways boss Vladimir Yakunin (left)

Although only banks with connections to high-ranking Russian officials have been targeted, Russian bank shares were broadly lower.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed 1.17% lower - having fallen 2.9% earlier on Friday, while shares in VTB Bank were 2.61% lower after falling 4.3% earlier in the day.

Other sectors were also hit. Gas giant Gazprom was down 0.9%, oil firm Lukoil ended the day 1.36% higher. Russian steel company NLMK closed 1.94% lower.

Shares in gas producer Novatek closed down 9.63%. The company is part owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder in Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy Russian businessmen targeted by Western sanctions.

Negative outlook

Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch warned they were changing their outlook for the Russian economy to "negative" from "stable" - the first stage before a possible downgrade in the country's credit rating - because of the potential impact of sanctions.

Fitch said: "Since US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Gennady Timchenko, owner of gas firm Novatek and shareholder in Bank Rossiya, has been targeted by sanctions

President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised the move, suggesting it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

Russia's credit rating is currently BBB.

Meanwhile the rouble was stable on Friday having previously fallen sharply on Thursday evening in response to the announcement of further US sanctions.

Later on Friday morning Germany said it had decided to suspend approval of all defence-related exports to Russia.

Berlin ordered defence contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear to Russia earlier this week.

The ministry spokesman said this was a "one-off" case, but future deals would also be blocked.

"The (Rheinmetall) case that you are talking about is a one-off case. Nevertheless it is true that given the current situation in Russia, we are not approving any exports of defence goods to this country at the moment," the spokesman said.###5495||Nearly all of the largest U.S. banks passed the Federal Reserve’s stress test, meaning they are prepared to withstand a severe recession or global downturn. Of the biggest 30 banks, only Zions Bancorp failed to meet the capital minimum required to survive a crisis.

“The largest banking institutions in the United States are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement.

While it’s safe to say that banks are safer, they’re far from reformed says Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the IMF and a professor of entrepreneurship at MIT.

Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Aaron Task sat down with Johnson at The Atlantic Economy Summit earlier this week (before the stress test results were announced) to discuss the state of U.S. banks.

“We need to keep moving the ball on this issue,” Johnson tells Task. “U.S. banks are supposed to produce a living will that shows how they should be broken up. I think there are many [government] officials who are questioning whether this exercise is being taken seriously by the banks and whether the banks are capable of demonstrating that they could fail without any government involvement.”

It appears that the big banks have moved away with from 2008 crisis and subsequent LIBOR controversies relatively scot-free. No executives were jailed, bank stocks and profits are nearing all-time highs and compensation for bank CEOs are approaching 2007 levels.

Related: Americans hate big banks, but can’t quit them

“There was an idea in 2005-2006 that banks had moved to some sort of new level in terms of technology and a philosophical understanding of the risks of finance and nobody says that anymore,” says Johnson. “Now they’re regarded as being very big political players, bullies in their markets, and people who behave inappropriately when given the opportunity. So that’s how they’re seen today which is quite different.”

But does that lead to improved policy and tighter constraints? “That remains to be seen,” says Johnson.

Chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart wants to pay more for used games than any other buyer.

Beginning March 26, customers at 3,100 stores will be able to trade in video games played on Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo consoles. The credit can be applied immediately toward the purchase of anything sold at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online.

Video games will be refurbished and sent back to stores in new packaging and sold as used games. Wal-Mart expects to start selling used games sometime this summer, depending on the inventory it collects, Mac Naughton said.

GameStop has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” GameStop said in a prepared statement. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Used games still represent about 30 percent of GameStop’s annual sales and about 40 percent of its profits.

Many other retailers exited or downplayed the video game segment because the industry seemed to be moving rapidly toward digital gaming. GameStop built up its digital business, strengthened its used business and amassed 30 million PowerUp reward program members.

Successful launches of the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 during the holiday shopping season signaled that gamers still aren’t willing to give up their hardware and software.

GameStop promoted its buyback program during the launch of the pricey new consoles. Trade-ins allowed customers to get a break on the consoles, which cost $500 and $400 and weren’t being discounted.

Best Buy also buys used games.

Wal-Mart is trying to build up its used business now because the Xbox One and PS4 are expected to have strong sales over the next couple of years.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,” Mac Naughton said. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

There are almost 1 billion games sitting around in homes, and 8 out of 10 are not being played, said Laura Phillips, senior vice president of entertainment for Wal-Mart U.S. “Customers are sitting on cash they can use at Wal-Mart,” Phillips said.

Wal-Mart recently entered the used-merchandise business, selling everything from refurbished TVs to smartphones.

By Phil Wahba

March 19 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday called on eBay Inc to sell 20 percent of its PayPal payments unit in an initial public offering, a change in tack from his previous call for a complete spinoff.

Icahn in January called for eBay to hive off its fast growing PayPal business, arguing the unit is undervalued as part of eBay.

In recent weeks, Icahn has sent a series of open letters critical of eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe, the board, and corporate governance at the e-commerce company.

In his latest missive to fellow eBay shareholders, he said selling off only part of PayPal would retain the benefits of a stand-alone PayPal while maintaining the efficiencies of having eBay and PayPal together.

“A partial separation of PayPal is not a new idea, and we’re glad to see that Mr. Icahn now seems to agree that a full separation of PayPal is not a good idea,” eBay said in a statement, re-iterating its position that the two businesses are better off under the same umbrella.

As a public company, the payments firm should also command a higher valuation than as part of a larger corporation, shedding the “conglomerate discount,” Icahn said. Its stock could then also be used to bankroll future acquisitions.

“Conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal - and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses - will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,” said Icahn, who owns more than 2 percent of eBay.

EBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002.

The billionaire Icahn said eBay and PayPal could enter into a long-term commercial contract that does not require eBay to own all of PayPal, to preserve their ties.

He also said PayPal has a significant opportunity to offer new services such as check writing and direct deposits.

A standalone PayPal and eBay would benefit from having their own independent management teams, Icahn argued.

PayPal needs to be independent to compete in the mobile payments industry, Icahn said, repeating an assertion he has frequently made in a series of open letters in recent weeks.

Among these subscribers, the number of Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) subscribers was close to27 million, representing an increase of over 70% year-on-year. FTTH subscribers accounted for nearly 30% of the total number of wireline broadband subscribers and the subscriber structure has been further optimised. Meanwhile, the Company accelerated the strategic restructuring of its business structure. Emerging businesses, including mobile data traffic, Internet applications and informatisation applications, experienced rapid growth of nearly30%, accounting for close to a quarter of the total revenue. The new customer acquisition approach led by applications and services achieved remarkable results.At present, China's deepening reform and accelerating the adjustment and restructuring of the national economy, together with accelerating social informatisation process with the promotion of information consumption and implementation of "Broadband China" strategy, offers vast market potential. Meanwhile, the global economy is still in a deep adjustment period. More industry reforms pushed by integrated development are emerging. "Customer flow, Data traffic flow and Capital flow" now become the new key value of the industry development. The value shifting in the industry is accelerated, while competition is further intensified in respect of its scope and magnitude with gradual roll-out of regulatory policies such as amendments to wireline broadband competition policies. As such, the Company will face new challenges.Chairman Wang Xiaochu expressed that with the 4G licensing, China Telecom embraces the best period of its full-services operations. The Company will grasp the opportunity for rapid development, proactively and appropriately tackle the challenges from regulatory and policy changes such as national tax reform, striving to create a New China Telecom. Based on the characteristics of its own resources, the Company will fully leverage the dual-technology strengths of wireline broadband and wireless broadband and continue to strengthen the wireline broadband network through the IPv6 evolution and fibre broadband. The Company will also actively apply for the permit of LTE FDD operation and will deploy LTE network appropriately with regard to the government policy and business development. A seamless high-speed mobile network built through the hybrid LTE network, coupled with highly efficient and coordinated development of 4G and 3G, will establish a full scene of network edge. The Company will deepen the reform to fully unleash employees' vibrancy and accelerate the evolution towards an Internet-business type operation model. Capitalising on- 3 -reform and innovation, the Company will firmly persist in the implementation of the "Three New Roles" strategy. With quality and efficiency enhancement, the Company will promote dual enhancement in scale development and profitability with continual reinforcement in competitiveness. By proactively open cooperation based on complementary resources and edge, the Company will endeavour to achieve a win-win cooperation in the industry value chain and accelerate the strategic planning of emerging businesses. The Company will strive to expand the value creation areas and continue to be the forerunner in the mobile Internet era, while continuously creating new values for shareholders.Certain statements contained in this announcement may be viewed as "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended) and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended).

How we make changes to this privacy policy###5503||New numbers released Monday show that the state's unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.

Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

Florida has added close to 200,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest amount in the nation according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Copyright Associated Press###5504||Empty###5505||Empty###5506||The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it will continue to gradually withdraw economic stimulus, but decided to move its goalposts for raising interest rates.

At the conclusion of Janet Yellen's first meeting as chair, the central bank announced a decision to reduce monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, down to $55 billion a month starting in April.

But the economy is still being supported through near-zero interest rates, which have been in place since 2008. As for when those rates would rise, policymakers decided to abandon their previous threshold of 6.5% unemployment, in favor of a broader view of the job market.

"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent," the statement said.

Forward guidance: The Fed modified its so-called forward guidance for a potential interest rate hike, because its previous guidance of 6.5% unemployment wasn't leaving much wiggle room.

The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in February. And according to its latest economic forecasts released Wednesday, the Fed now believes the unemployment rate could fall as low as 6.1% this year.

The Fed has now decided to move toward a more qualitative approach in determining interest rate policy.

"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments," Fed officials wrote in the statement.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Yellen said the job market has improved more than many had anticipated, though she stressed that it's still weak and offered a list of various labor market measures that the Fed would be looking at.

Yellen said repeatedly that the change in guidance does not signal any immediate shift in the Fed's current policy intentions. She said rates would likely remain low for a "considerable period" after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.

Investors were spooked after Yellen responded to a question by suggesting that a "considerable period" could be defined as around six months. That led investors to believe that rates could rise sooner than previously thought. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 100 points in afternoon trading.

Tapering: The Fed has been buying bonds -- mainly long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities -- since September 2012 in an attempt to stimulate the economy. But it began reducing the program this year in a process nicknamed "tapering."

The Fed has said it would continue its plan to taper by $10 billion a month unless its outlook for the economy changed substantially.

While the job market had been in a rut over the winter, economists have speculated that the slump was a temporary result of extreme weather, and indicators would recover in spring.

In its statement, the Fed said economic activity slowed during the winter months, "in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."

Yellen said bad weather contributed to a spate of weak economic data over the first few months of the year. But she said most Fed officials expect the drag from cold weather will "begin to wash out in second quarter."

Only one Fed member formally dissented against the statement. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota felt that the change in forward guidance could weaken the Fed's credibility and cause uncertainty.###5507||A market dominated by GameStop is about to see another huge entrant as Walmart is set to launch a used video game purchasing program next week across its nationwide network of 3,100 retail stores. The Wall Street Journal reports that Walmart will begin buying used games next week and will pay gamers anywhere from a few dollars to $35 or more for used titles. Payments will be made in the form of Walmart gift cards that can be used to purchase any products from Walmart stores or the company’s website.

Walmart’s move into the space that has traditionally been dominated by GameStop comes as sales of Microsoft and Sony’s next-generation video game consoles really get underway. Despite the surge in console hardware sales, however, new software sales are still lagging — likely thanks in part to the large market for buying and selling used games.

Where gamers are concerned, Walmart’s move could lead to increased competition for used game acquisition. This could mean more money and more promotions ultimately being made available to gamers as Walmart, GameStop and other retailers battle for business.###5508||Empty###5509||The international effort to find the missing Malaysian airliner is being intensified, after Chinese satellite pictures showed what could be debris in the Indian Ocean.

The move was criticised both within Turkey and overseas, as users accessed Twitter via proxies and other work-arounds. President Abdullah Gul was one of them, posting to his Twitter account that the total ban of a social media platform "can't be condoned" and that he hoped it wouldn't last.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called Erdogan's ban a "groundless, pointless, cowardly" act of censorship. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the premier is "waging a campaign against all the media and press that he cannot directly influence or control."

The shutdown began hours after Erdogan said San Francisco-based Twitter had ignored court orders to remove content related to the graft investigation. He's also threatened to block Facebook and YouTube, where users have shared material including videos, recordings and transcripts that were first leaked via Twitter. Some of them are tied to a police investigation of government corruption which has cost four cabinet ministers their jobs and roiled markets.

It has been estimated that there are 10 million Twitter users in Turkey.###5512||Empty###5513||Empty###5514||Antivirus and security software company Symantec has fired its CEO, effective immediately, and as a result of the termination shares of its stock are falling fast in Thursday's after-hours trading session.

Symantec, which produces Norton Antivirus and other anti-virus software, announced Thursday afternoon that president and CEO Steve Bennett is out, and board member Michael Brown has been elected as interim president and CEO and will take Bennett's place immediately. Symantec said that the search for a permanent CEO will also begin immediately.

The chairman of Symantec's board, Daniel Schulman, said in a statement that Bennett's termination was "not precipitated by any event or impropriety," but rather the result of an ongoing deliberative process. Schulman also said that the board recognizes Bennett's contributions as CEO, which included "developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness."

Bennett has only been Symantec's CEO since July of 2012, and was chairman of Symantec's board from 2011 to 2013. Prior to joining Symantec, Bennett served as president and CEO of technology company Intuit from 2007 to 2011; before that, he had a 23-year career at General Electric , holding management roles in a variety of GE businesses including GE Capital, GE Appliances and GE Medical Systems.

Schulman said that Symantec's priority now is "to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

In the release announcing Bennett's termination, Symantec also reaffirmed its fourth quarter fiscal 2014 outlook, saying that it expects revenue of $1.6 to $1.66 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in the prior-year period. Including special items, it expects its fourth quarter profit to fall somewhere between 29 cents and 31 cents per share compared to 27 cents during the same time in 2013, and excluding those special items expects to see a profit between 40 cents and 42 cents per share, compared to 44 cents per share this same time last year.

Following the news that Bennett has been fired, shares of Symantec halted briefly in Thursday's after-hours trading session after finishing the day with a 1.58%; when trading resumed, shares fell as much as 10%. They've since recovered some of those losses and are currently down about 6.5%. After finishing 2013 trading with a 20% gain, Symantec shares have fallen 12.3% during the first two and a half months of 2014.###5515||Looking for a good boss? This list might be the place to start. Glassdoor has released its annual list of the Highest Rated CEOs for 2014, determined by employee feedback. As you can imagine, several technology names are near the top of the list, including Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn (#1); Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm (#4); and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (#9).

Also worth noting is the number of Seattle retailers who score high in the list, including Craig Jelinek of Costco (#5); Howard Schultz of Starbucks (#8); Blake Nordstrom of Nordstrom (#23); and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com (#32).

Microsoft’s new boss, Satya Nadella, does not make the list. But Ford’s Alan Mulally, who was in the running for the top post, finished in the second slot with a 97 percent approval rating.

“Top rated CEOs are commonly seen as relatable, accessible and transparent,” said Robert Hohman, Glassdoor CEO and co-founder.

Glassdoor also released for the first time a list of the top 25 CEOs at small and mid-sized companies. Several tech CEOs make the list, including a few from the Seattle area such as Zillow’s Spencer Rascoff and Edifecs Sunny Singh.###5516||Empty###5517||Empty###5518||It's not just Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime loyalty shopping program that is getting more expensive. Pandora (NYSE:P) revealed last night that its premium Pandora One offering will also soon set music buffs back a little more.

Existing monthly Internet radio subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 a month -- for now -- but new subscribers will have to shell out $4.99 a month starting in May. This doesn't mean that existing premium members won't pay more. The annual Pandora One plan that costs $36 -- or $3 a month -- is being discontinued. Users will migrate to the $3.99-a-month plan.

Pandora said the increases are necessary. It hasn't tweaked its prices since 2009, yet in that time the royalty rates that it pays to artists through SoundExchange have soared 53%. It's a similar rationale that Amazon used with its $20 Prime fee increase, arguing that shipping costs alone have escalated in the nine years that it stuck to the $79-a-year pricing.

However, some may wonder if Pandora is picking the wrong time to push through an increase. Amazon doesn't really have any material competition when it comes to e-commerce, but Pandora is starting to feel the pinch from the competition. Listener hours in February rose just 9% since last year's showing. This is the first time that year-over-year growth at Pandora has slumped into the single digits. It's a far cry from the 101% and 42% growth spurts that Pandora had posted in prior February installments.

Growth is still growth, but Pandora's monthly metrics have showed sequential spottiness since Apple introduced iTunes Radio in mid-September. One can argue that most of Pandora's listeners are freeloaders, making this increase irrelevant. That's true. Just 3.3 million of its 75.3 million active listeners are paying Pandora for commercial-free access. The other 72 million are fine putting up with ads and any other limitations that Pandora may throw their way.

In terms of premium competition, Sirius XM Radio (NASDAQ:SIRI) listeners with satellite receiver plans can pay an additional $4 a month for online access. Pandora's pricing now makes its online offering more expensive than Sirius XM's add-on platform. That's worth noting.

This still doesn't make the price hike a dumb move by Pandora. If anything, pre-announcing that the increase will take place in May could encourage current freeloaders to sign up for the $3.99 a month in the next few weeks so that they will be grandfathered into the lower rate. The move should also help with Pandora One churn. Folks will be less tempted to cancel the service if they know that coming back would cost them $4.99 a month.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration proposed new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

"Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can't finish, we won't shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don't have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can't get coverage again until next year," HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare's six-month enrollment period. Most of those bug have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website's capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.###5520||Empty###5521||Empty###5522||NEW YORK - The "everyday low price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

NEW YORK � The �everyday low price� king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

Wal-Mart said it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products with those of its competitors. The world�s largest retailer began offering the feature that�s called �Savings Catcher� on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers such as Target and Best Buy are offering to match the lower prices of rivals � but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart�s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn�t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit-card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it�s successful, others might follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.�s U.S. discount division, said shoppers are looking for �technological answers to saving them money and time.�

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program will be rolled out nationwide, said it�s hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Walmart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart�s �everyday low price� model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper.

On top of that, the retailer�s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.###5523||A major change has happened at the top of security firm Symantec, with CEO Steve Bennett being sacked, replaced by Michael Brown who will be an interim CEO while the search for a new chief exec takes place.

Bennett hadn't yet made the two year mark in the role, but clearly, things weren't turning out as the board expected. Symantec didn't give a clear explanation as to exactly why they had parted ways with Bennett – but it did at least say that it wasn't due to any massive faux pas on his behalf.

Chairman of the board Daniel Schulman said: "This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

He also said: "We recognise Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future."

Michael Brown, the chap now temporarily in charge, joined Symantec's board in 2005, and was previously CEO of Quantum Corporation, which doubled its revenue under his stewardship.

Brown said: "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan."###5524||* Bennett second CEO to be fired by Symantec in less than two years

* Board member Michael Brown to take over as interim CEO

* Reaffirms fourth-quarter outlook

* Shares fall 10 pct in extended trading (Adds details, analysts’ comments)

By Soham Chatterjee

March 20 (Reuters) - Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” the company said.

“It’s a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company’s turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5 percent organic growth and higher than 30 percent adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5 percent revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.

Symantec had been reorganizing its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

“Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list,” Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. (r.reuters.com/jur77v)

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser###5528||Most of the major currency pairs are trading higher this morning or making their way into positive territory. Foreign exchange investors have nerves of steel today, bidding up euro on the official announcement of sanctions on Russian politicians by the U.S. and EU. The U.S. announced plans to freeze the assets of 11 key Russian and Ukrainian officials and the EU will impose sanctions on 21 members of the Ukrainian and Russian government involved in Moscow’s incursion into Crimea. The euro is responding well to these initial measures because they are limited to a small group but today’s announcements represent the international community’s very first response to Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. If Russian troops move into Ukraine, more severe and widespread sanctions are sure to follow. There is very little chance that Russia will bat an eye at these sections. In fact, Putin has threatened his own restrictions, which could be announced in the coming hours or days. So while risk appetite has improved today, under these circumstances, it will be very difficult for the optimism to be sustained because there is a high risk of the crisis in the Ukraine deepening. However, until Russia retaliates investors are buying euros on the relief that the initial sanctions are mild and the currency could aim for fresh 2-year highs.

The aftermath of the referendum in Crimea this weekend is not the only big story in the foreign exchange market. On Saturday, China also doubled its Chinese Yuan trading band. They will now allow the CNY to fluctuate 2% above or below its daily midpoint rate, up from 1%. Given the currency’s recent rapid decent, this decision was not a complete surprise and had only a limited impact on major currencies. Nonetheless it represents a major shift in FX policy for the central bank. The PBoC is clearly using the exchange rate as a means to increase stimulus and provide additional support to its economy as growth slows. With exports falling by the largest amount in more than 4 years during the month of February, the economy could certainly use the support of a weaker currency, which helps to make the cost of Chinese imports more competitive. Although the central bank argues that today’s move is a step towards increasing exchange rate flexibility and greater two-way volatility in the currency, in the context of falling exports the recent slide in the Yuan clearly reflects an attempt to support the economy. A weaker Yuan hurts countries like Australia and Japan who rely heavily on Chinese demand. However even though trade balances could suffer, the AUD and JPY have taken the band winding in stride. For the U.S., China’s announcement impacts the dollar by slowing reserve accumulation. Yet like AUD and JPY, there has been very little reaction in the U.S. dollar.

This morning’s U.S. economic reports did not have much impact on the greenback. Manufacturing activity in the NY region increased slightly less than expected in the month of March but concerns about the sector was offset by a strong rise in industrial and manufacturing production along with an increase in capacity utilization. The NAHB housing market index rose, reflecting an improvement in builder confidence but the increase fell short expectations. As long as these reports show an improvement in the economy, it poses very little threat to the dollar ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC rate decision.###5529||Empty###5530||Empty###5531||A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"we are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Three-penny bit".

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"we're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (ISIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, Queen Elizabeth's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman said: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency." National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 (UPI) -- In its latest round of fundraising, Airbnb could attract up to $400 million in funds, valuing the startup at more than $10 billion.

Leading the pack of investors is TPG, which has already taken on many other Silicon Valley startups like Uber. If Airbnb manages to raise between $400 and $500 million, it will make them one of the most valuable startups in the world. In hits last fundraising round, Airbnb raised cash based on a $2.5 billion valuation.

There has been a lot buzz generated among technology companies, especially startups, following the $19 billion purchase of messaging app WhatsApp by Facebook. Facebook itself was one of the most popular startups in the technology segment, now valued at around $72 billion.

Airbnb helps connect travelers with people interested in renting out their homes or even a room for a fee, with the company collecting a portion of the fee. The company is also under scrutiny from regulators who are looking at whether the company's services is depriving states of taxes.

The proposal ties compensation for chief executive John Martin to wider access to the drug maker’s popular roster of HIV and hepatitis C treatments.

The shareholder resolution from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has previously lambasted Gilead and other drug makers over their pricing, was proposed in response to the recently approved Sovaldi pill for hepatitis C. Gilead priced its medicine at $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, which works out to $1,000 a day. As a result, AHF maintains that Sovaldi will be unaffordable for some patients.

Such concerns, in fact, prompted the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee to ask Gilead to explain the rationale behind its pricing. In a letter sent yesterday to the drug maker, the lawmakers worry that Sovaldi pricing may be too high for patients with public or private insurance. A report released last week by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that is supported, in part, by insurers, forecast that Sovaldi may negatively burden health-care budgets.

New York is taking a closer look at high-frequency traders—and how stock exchanges are helping them, for a price.

Eric Schneiderman, the state’s attorney general, said he has opened an investigation into the sale of products and services that offer high-frequency traders faster access to data. Schneiderman has made the combating of what he calls “Insider Trading 2.0” a central focus.

Stock markets charge traders thousands of dollars to “co-locate” their servers at the exchanges’ data centers, giving them access to data milliseconds before those whose servers are elsewhere. Schneiderman is also looking at dark pools and at high-frequency traders themselves.

“This new breed of predatory behavior gives a small segment of the industry an enormous advantage over all other competitors and allows them to use new technologies to reap huge profits based on very, very minor, but nonetheless unfair, advantages,” Schneiderman said yesterday. “Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets, as structured today, are increasingly too focused on catering to them.”

The attorney general said he would push for new rules to curtail those advantages.

“My office is going to continue to shine a light on unseemly practices,” Schneiderman said. “I look forward to joining with other regulators and my colleagues in government in taking real, concrete steps to deal with this problem.”###5546||Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will start buying used video games from customers next week, setting its sights on a business perfected by Grapevine-based GameStop Corp.

Chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart wants to pay more for used games than any other buyer.

Beginning March 26, customers at 3,100 stores will be able to trade in video games played on Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo consoles. The credit can be applied immediately toward the purchase of anything sold at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online.

Video games will be refurbished and sent back to stores in new packaging and sold as used games. Wal-Mart expects to start selling used games sometime this summer, depending on the inventory it collects, Mac Naughton said.

GameStop has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” GameStop said in a prepared statement. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Used games still represent about 30 percent of GameStop’s annual sales and about 40 percent of its profits.

Many other retailers exited or downplayed the video game segment because the industry seemed to be moving rapidly toward digital gaming. GameStop built up its digital business, strengthened its used business and amassed 30 million PowerUp reward program members.

Successful launches of the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 during the holiday shopping season signaled that gamers still aren’t willing to give up their hardware and software.

GameStop promoted its buyback program during the launch of the pricey new consoles. Trade-ins allowed customers to get a break on the consoles, which cost $500 and $400 and weren’t being discounted.

Best Buy also buys used games.

Wal-Mart is trying to build up its used business now because the Xbox One and PS4 are expected to have strong sales over the next couple of years.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,” Mac Naughton said. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

There are almost 1 billion games sitting around in homes, and 8 out of 10 are not being played, said Laura Phillips, senior vice president of entertainment for Wal-Mart U.S. “Customers are sitting on cash they can use at Wal-Mart,” Phillips said.

Wal-Mart recently entered the used-merchandise business, selling everything from refurbished TVs to smartphones.

The world’s largest retailer said the game trade-in program will begin at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores on March 26. Customers will be able to buy the refurbished games in those stores and online later this year.

Currently, Wal-Mart offers trade-ins online, but only in a limited capacity.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

The program will allow customers to exchange used games for store credit -- but not cash. Wal-Mart said the trade-in games will be sent out to be refurbished and “made available for purchase in like-new condition.”

Games eligible for trade-in must be in their original packaging, and they will be evaluated for damages by electronics department staff. Customers will receive a specific trade-in value for each game, which they can use immediately at any Walmart or Sam’s Club store, or online at Walmart.com and SamsClub.com. USA Today reported that values will vary by game “from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.”

Customers will be able to purchase pre-owned, used video games in stores and online later this year. Games will be marked “Certified Pre-Owned,” or “fully refurbished and in like-new condition.”

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” Mac Naughton said.###5548||Empty###5549||Bankrupt Bitcoin currency exchange, Mt.

Last month, Mt. Gox, announced that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins in a theft. The total value of the lost bitcoins, which also included the company's own 100,000 bitcoins, was estimated to be $473 million. The company revealed the theft and soon after filed for bankruptcy.

Now, as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings, the company claims to have found 200,000 bitcoins in "old format" electronic wallets. These recovered bitcoins are worth $120 million at the current exchange rate. According to the announcement posted by the Japanese exchange on its website, it now holds a total of 202,000 bitcoins out of which 2000 bitcoins were with the company prior to the civil rehabilitation filing.

The investigations for the remaining 650,000 bitcoins are being carried out and the company will be updating users with new developments. Mt. Gox reopened its website recently so that users who have their money stored with the exchange's wallet service could check their balance. It may also be looking to rebrand itself and recover from the theft once the investigations conclude, but for now it is still far from recovering the lost money.

Being forced into retirement by a shiny and more efficient new model is always tough.

So spare a thought for the £1 coin, which after 30 years of loyal service will be replaced in 2017 by a new one, shaped like the old thrupenny bit.

The 12-sided coin is being lauded by the government as the ‘most secure coin in circulation in the world,’ and it will be unveiled by George Osborne today.

‘The coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting-edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the threepenny bit.’

WASHINGTON — More than 20,000 taxpayers have been targeted by fake Internal Revenue Service agents in the largest phone scam of its kind the agency knows of, the IRS inspector general said on Thursday.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes and demand payment with a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration.

Legitimate IRS agents usually initiate contact by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early, the office said. But the scam has become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” he said in a statement. “The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming.”

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected.

The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the office said.

The scam has been effective in part because scammers mask caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of targets' Social Security numbers and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are not connected to a bank account.

Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores and use them just like a bank card until the money runs out or they add more.###5554||WASHINGTON – A federal appeals court has handed a defeat to a coalition of retail groups that challenged as too high the Federal Reserve’s cap on how much banks can charge businesses for handling debit card transactions.

The ruling issued Friday by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a lower court’s decision in July that favored the merchants and was a setback for banks.

In the July ruling, a federal judge struck down the Fed’s cap on so-called “swipe fees,” saying the Fed didn’t have the authority to set the limit the way it did in 2011, improperly including data that made the cap too high.

The retail groups had sued the Fed over its setting the cap at an average of about 24 cents per debit-card transaction. The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.

Congress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.

The retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.

The three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.

The National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.

“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”

The Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.

The banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Hunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”

“Make no doubt about it – consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.

The American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.

The fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.

Banks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.

Banks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.

The retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.

The Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, a big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop, based on an industry fixed-rate system that allowed lower rates for companies with bigger customer volume. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.

The Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.###5555||Iowa’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January edged up to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent in December

Iowa’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January edged up to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent in December. The current rate compares favorably with the January 2013 rate of 5.0 percent. The U.S. unemployment rate for January inched down to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent in December. This was the lowest national rate since October 2008.

“Despite a slight increase in the January unemployment rate, Iowa’s unemployment conditions have improved substantially from one year ago,” said Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development. “The state’s annual average unemployment rate for 2013 dropped to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2012. Iowa had the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation in 2013.”

The number of unemployed state residents increased slightly to 71,700 in January from 71,000 in December. The current estimate is 11,800 below last year’s level of 83,500.

The total number of working Iowans continued to trend upward in January, reaching 1,606,100. This figure was 1,300 higher than December, and 21,600 higher than one year ago.###5556||Japanese car maker Toyota is expected to reach a billion-dollar settlement with the US justice department to stop a criminal probe into the company's disclosure of safety issues, most notably dangerous unintended acceleration of some cars.

The company is set to pay more than $1bn (£602m, €718m) to the department in order to cap its four-year investigation, according to media reports. The fine is one of the largest ever imposed on an auto maker.

The settlement is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement, allowing Toyota to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. The settlement is not final and could still fall apart, according to WSJ.

A spokeswoman for Toyota told the newspaper that the company has been addressing many issues raised in the investigation.

"Toyota has cooperated with the US attorney's office in this matter for more than four years," Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said.

"During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organisation, and we are committed to continued improvements."

Unintended Acceleration

Toyota had to recall millions of vehicles due to unintended acceleration in the late 2000s. The problem resulted in the death of a number of people in the US.

While the company recalled the problematic vehicles promptly, the US Justice Department found Toyota had made misleading statements about safety problems to the government and to the public. The investigation was led by the office of Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara.

The auto maker has been fined four times for a total of $66.2m by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for failing to report safety defects to the government. Three of those fines were related to issues concerning unwanted acceleration.

Toyota has never admitted wrongdoing in any of the law suits brought against it involving unintended acceleration.

The agreement with Toyota comes as the justice department is looking into a safety issue at General Motors.

GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. There were allegations that GM engineers knew about the issue years ago but the automaker was reluctant to recall vehicles until last month.###5557||After two days of gains that have taken U.S. stocks right back to within sneezing distance of their all-time highs, one might expect the market to remain in a holding pattern until the outcome of the Fed's monetary policy meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release its statement at 2 p.m. EDT, followed by Janet Yellen's first press conference as Fed chairwoman. The benchmark S&P 500 and the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) were up 0.01% and 0.09%, respectively, as of 10:20 a.m. EDT. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will be on investors' radar this morning after releasing disappointing fiscal second-quarter results yesterday afternoon -- shares are down 3% this morning.

The enterprise software giant missed Wall Street's expectations for adjusted earnings per share, revenue, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- a crude measure of cash flow). On EPS, this constitutes Oracle's third miss in the past five quarters; on revenue, it's four misses in five quarters; and on EBITDA, it's five misses in five quarters. But look at the magnitude of the latest misses: its largest, for EPS, was less than 3%; on revenue, the miss was less than half a percentage point.

There were more positive aspects to the results, too. Notably, revenue from hardware systems products rose 8% to $725 million -- the first such increase since Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 (although it's not clear that this is enough to justify the $5.6 billion purchase price). The growth in hardware revenue relates to the 30% growth (on a constant currency basis) in the engineered server systems business, which was one of the highlights of the quarter. As Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement:

Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have to.

Cloud software subscription revenue grew 25% in the quarter, with quarterly cloud application revenue now approaching $300 million. Large enterprise software vendors, including IBM and Microsoft, are now offering their products in the cloud -- software running on hosted hardware -- as corporate IT buyers shift toward this lower-maintenance format.

Oracle suffers from the curse of size, both in terms of its ability to be nimble and to grow its revenue base. Nevertheless, I continue to think the company is well positioned to serve its corporate customers. No one is reasonably expecting Oracle to generate massive growth at this stage, but at less than 12.5 times next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate, one can expect the shares to produce reasonable returns going forward, with good odds of outperforming the broad market.###5558||**UPDATE: Given the enormous interest and response from readers, including many Walmart employees, vendors and other associates, I will continue to update this story on a new Page Five as more emails come in. Of course, if we receive an official Walmart response, I'll include that as well.



"Your reporting about Wal-Mart deserves wide distribution. Shareholders should be in open revolt about this train wreck of an organization." --Reader Email

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- As I have noted in recent days, the response to my recent Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stories has been nothing short of overwhelming.

It all started with 24 Pictures From a Walmart Store That Make Sears Look Classy.

A considerable portion of it comes from readers who work at Walmart. Many of the emails I have received from Walmart employees, independent of one another, corroborate one another. I'll publish a representative sampling in this article.

Of course, I keep identities anonymous if that was what was requested. In other cases, I mention specific stores but do not include details that would out specific individuals.

I have repeatedly asked Walmart for comment and have received no response.

The responses I received from readers indicates a systemic problem at Walmart -- one created by folks at the corporate level, not on the ground, in retail stores. In fact, given the position Walmart appears to have put many of its retail workers in, it's amazing enough of them can keep it together well enough to keep the business running. Without considerable intervention, this can't possibly end well. In fact, I really believe we're watching a failure unfold in front of our eyes. But it's one we're watching spring from the ground up, even though the people on the ground should not be held culpable.

If Walmart doesn't act fast to right the ship, disgruntled employees and dirty stores might become more than a minor irritation. They could further damage the business and, in turn, the company's stock price.

First, consider the following (lightly edited, bold emphasis added) email from a Walmart employee, who will remain completely anonymous:

Regarding your photos of Wal-Mart article, when I read it I just had to laugh. I work at a Wal-Mart and I can tell you with no uncertainty that the single reason for all of the problems in those photos is understaffing. This is not a store by store problem, either; it is a corporate problem. Corporate decides how many hours we are allowed to schedule employees with each week and how many employees we are allowed to hire, and it usually falls short of what we, the employees, feel we need.

For instance, resets used to be done by a 3rd shift team, but they were a small team and could only ever get grocery resets done, so we in the general merchandise area had to do our own during the day. It's irrelevant now, as the reset team has since been eliminated.

I address the excuse that the mess I photo-illustrated at the South LA Walmart exists because of "resets" (wholesale reshaping/restocking of large sections of a store) in Monday's Walmart: Retail's Biggest Embarrassment.

The emailer continues by outlining what happens on the ground as a result of this understaffing:

Every week for the last 5 years, and every DAY for the last 2-3 months, 1st and 2nd shift employees at our store have been responsible for stocking freight from the previous day's trucks because we don't have enough 3rd shift stockers to accomplish this. That means every single day we have pallets on the floor in almost every general merchandise department, with associates -- who are supposed to be focused on other things like helping customers -- stocking shelves. With so much time dedicated to stocking, we have little time left to put away carts of junk or clean up aisles (as seen in your photos). If we try to do our real job duties instead, we get yelled at by management for not dealing with the freight. Most days the backup of freight in the back room is so bad we literally can't move back there, which means if a customer wants something that's back there, they aren't getting it.

The emailer closes with this:

You are right to say executives should be embarrassed of all this.

Another emailer corroborates the original emailer's statement regarding "resets" with the following correspondence:

###5559||iNVEZZ.com, Tuesday 18 March:

The ZEW German Economic Sentiment Index for March has checked in today at 46.6, missing by a country mile the market consensus for 52.8 and even more measurably below February’s 55.7. As well, ZEW’s Economic Sentiment Index for the Eurozone has dropped to 61.5 this month, falling short of expectations for a more modest decline to 67.3 from February’s 68.5.

Since the releases, the EUR/USD has dropped to as low as 1.3889, marginally above yesterday’s bottom at 1.3878.

Nordea Markets FX strategist Aurelija Augulyte believes that, contrary to common understanding, the best chance for the US dollar to strengthen against the euro is if the US economic data should continue to surprise to the downside.

“In normal times, the EURUSD will trend higher”, writes Augulyte. By ‘normal times’ she means a period when the US economy is growing and the country is spending more than it’s earning and running a current account deficit.

Augulyte emphasizes that “USD strengthening needs panic, recession, volatility”. In her view, the relatively low volatility since the start of 2014 coupled “with the hope that the US data weakness is temporary has brought the EURUSD up, almost to the projected level (1.3967)”.

The weakness of US data over the winter months has been partly weather-affected, “but to which extent, we will only find out in April/May”, notes the FX strategist. Should the data keep weakening in Q2, then the euro could take a sharper turn lower, but, Augulyte says, Nordea’s official view is that that is not likely to happen.

Augulyte’s baseline scenario is for the EUR/USD to experience “a temporary correction” to 1.365-1.37 before going back to 1.395 and ultimately above 1.40.

Right now, the currency pair is trading at around 1.3915, down 0.07 percent intraday.###5560||Warning Of IRS Nationwide Phone Scam Video

Last month, Mt. Gox, announced that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins in a theft. The total value of the lost bitcoins, which also included the company's own 100,000 bitcoins, was estimated to be $473 million. The company revealed the theft and soon after filed for bankruptcy.

Now, as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings, the company claims to have found 200,000 bitcoins in "old format" electronic wallets. These recovered bitcoins are worth $120 million at the current exchange rate. According to the announcement posted by the Japanese exchange on its website, it now holds a total of 202,000 bitcoins out of which 2000 bitcoins were with the company prior to the civil rehabilitation filing.

The investigations for the remaining 650,000 bitcoins are being carried out and the company will be updating users with new developments. Mt. Gox reopened its website recently so that users who have their money stored with the exchange's wallet service could check their balance. It may also be looking to rebrand itself and recover from the theft once the investigations conclude, but for now it is still far from recovering the lost money.

Three Australian planes took off at dawn Saturday for a third day of scouring the region about 2,500 kilometres southwest of Perth.

Australian officials tried to tamp down expectations after a fruitless search Friday, even as they pledged to continue the effort. “It’s about the most inaccessible spot that you could imagine on the face of the Earth, but if there is anything down there, we will find it,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at a news conference in Papua New Guinea. “We owe it to the families and the friends and the loved ones of the almost 240 people on Flight MH370 to do everything we can to try to resolve what is as yet an extraordinary riddle,” he added.

Six aircraft were to search the region Saturday: two ultra long-range commercial jets and four P3 Orions, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. While the Orions are able to search for only two hours at a time, the commercial jets can stay in the search area for five hours before they must head back to the base. Two merchant ships were in the area, and the HMAS Success, a navy supply ship, was due to arrive late Saturday afternoon. Weather in the search zone was expected to be relatively good, with some cloud cover. Two Chinese aircraft are expected to arrive in Perth on Saturday to join the search, and two Japanese aircraft will arrive Sunday. A small flotilla of ships from China is still several days away. AMSA officials also were checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information.

Abbott spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing him as “devastated.” The passengers included 154 Chinese. In Kuala Lumpur, where the plane took off for Beijing, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein thanked the more than two dozen countries involved in the overall search that stretches from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

The search area indicated by the satellite images in the southern Indian Ocean is a four-hour round-trip flight from western Australia, leaving planes with only enough fuel to search for about two hours. The images were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them. Searchers on Friday relied mostly on trained spotters aboard the planes rather than radar, which found nothing Thursday, Australian officials said. The search will focus more on visual sightings because civilian aircraft are being brought in. The military planes will continue to use both radar and spotters. “Noting that we got no radar detections yesterday, we have replanned the search to be visual. So aircraft flying relatively low, very highly skilled and trained observers looking out of the aircraft windows and looking to see objects,” said John Young, manager of the maritime safety authority’s emergency response division. Malaysia asked the U.S. for undersea surveillance equipment to help in the search, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. There is a limited battery life for the beacons in the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders — about 30 days, said Chuck Schofield, vice-president of business development for Dukane Seacom Inc. The devices work to a depth of 6,100 metres, with a signal range of about two nautical miles, depending on variables like sea conditions. The signals are located using a device operated on the surface of the water or towed to a depth. Experts say it is impossible to tell if the grainy satellite images of the two objects — one 24 metreslong and the other measuring 5 metres — were debris from the plane. But officials have called this the best lead so far in the search that began March 8 after the plane vanished over the Gulf of Thailand on an overnight flight to Beijing. Aircraft pieces have sometimes been found floating for days after a sea crash. Peter Marosszeky, an aviation expert at the University of New South Wales, said the wing could remain buoyant for weeks if fuel tanks inside it were empty and had not filled with water. Other experts said that if the aircraft breaks into pieces, normally only items such as seats and luggage would remain floating. “We seldom see big metal (pieces) floating. You need a lot of (buoyant) material underneath the metal to keep it up,” said Lau Kin-tak, an expert in aircraft maintenance and accidents at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

The numbers changed very little in January, the period for the current report. Forty-three states and the District of Columbia had unemployment rate decreases from December, one state had an increase and six states had no change at all. Every one of the 50 states and the District of Columbia had unemployment rate decreases from January 2013. For perspective, the national jobless rate for the January was 6.6%.

All three major U.S. stock indices were down on the committee's afternoon statement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI)falling 44 points as of 3 p.m. EDT.

The Federal Reserve in recent months has moved away from its stance connecting the unemployment rate to its readiness to lift interest rates, and that trend continued today. While the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, it's mostly because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search. The Fed recognizes that issue and today announced that it would drop the unemployment rate as the primary measuring stick for the economy's strength. It will instead rely on a multitude of factors to decide when raising interest rates is the correct move. With that in mind, here are some large industrial companies making headlines today.

Inside the Dow, Boeing (NYSE:BA) had a couple of favorable headlines hit the news feed today. Boeing and Comair announced an order for eight 737 MAX 8s, the first such order from an African operator. The order was actually booked in December 2013 but was previously unidentified on the Boeing orders and deliveries website; it is valued at $830 million at list prices. This order will support future fleet expansion for the brands operated by Comair. There's also an option for the carrier to take another eight aircraft in the future.

In other positive news for the aviation juggernaut, the Federal Aviation Administration announced today that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is safe after a thorough review of its lithium-ion battery issues.

"We concluded that the aircraft was soundly designed, and that Boeing and the FAA had processes in place that were designed to identify and correct any issue that might arise during the manufacturing process," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said, according to USA Today. "It's many layered. You don't have single points of failure."

This is welcome news for Boeing investors who have grown weary of the Dreamliner project running over budget due to production delays and other issues. As production of the 787 Dreamliner continues to accelerate, investors hope the project will become profitable for Boeing in 2016.

Outside the Dow, investors of General Motors are hoping that its recent recalls of millions of vehicles globally doesn't turn into a nightmare akin to Toyota's (NYSE:TM) unintended acceleration problems. Toyota just agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine, which is the largest penalty imposed on any automaker, according to federal prosecutors. Ultimately, the defect led to a recall of more than 10 million vehicles and the company's admission to concealing information and making false statements regarding safety issues.

"Other car companies should not repeat Toyota's mistake," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned in a statement, according to Automotive News. "A recall may damage a company's reputation, but deceiving your customers makes that damage far more lasting."

Toyota will record the $1.2 billion in after-tax charges against earnings. While this is a huge penalty it won't put a dent in the automaker's cash pile of nearly $60 billion. That said, this drawn-out process could have larger ramifications for its brand inside the automotive industry, where Toyota long ago captured the image of reliability and safety. While General Motors is beginning its own battle with ignition issues linked to at least 12 deaths, Toyota's tarnished image could open up the door for Ford to continue increasing its market share and positive brand image in the U.S. market.###5576||Empty###5577||Photo by AMSA via Getty Images

The big news from overnight in the search for MH370, via the Associated Press:

Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in northeast Ohio.

An Australian search and rescue official says that planes have been sent to check on two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight that were spotted on satellite imagery in the Indian Ocean about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth.

But John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority cautioned Thursday against expectations that this may help solve the mystery of the plane that went missing with 239 people on board nearly two weeks ago. Young told reporters, "We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sited close-up."

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. One of the objects spotted was said to be 24 meters (nearly 80 feet) in length and the other 5 meters (about 15 feet) long. Both were in an area that officials described as being about a four-hour flight off Australia's southwestern coast.

The satellite images represent the first significant new lead investigators have had in days, but there is still plenty of reason for caution. This search has already contained more than its fair share of red herrings, including (most notably in this particular case) satellite images released by China in the days after the jetliner went missing that appeared to show debris floating roughly in the area the 777 disappeared from air traffic control radar. A search of that area, however, turned up nothing and investigators have since shifted their attention to the opposite side of the Malaysian peninsula and well beyond.

The new images were actually recorded four days ago—on March 16—but were somewhat lost in the shuffle given the massive scale of the area being searched. "Due to the volume of imagery being searched, and the detailed process of analysis that followed," the info wasn't brought to the attention of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority until Thursday morning local time, according to an official statement from the agency.



Australia quickly dispatched four planes to investigate the area in question—described as a 23,000 square-kilometer area about 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth—but the search produced no debris sightings by the end of the day local time. (The fact that it's a four-hour flight out and a four-hour one back isn't making things any easier for the planes doing the sweep.) The search will begin again Friday morning, according to officials.

In the Japanese and English-language statement (PDF) posted to the company’s website on Thursday, CEO Mark Karpeles explained that the company confirmed the discovery on March 7, 2014 and reported it to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo on March 10.

Mt. Gox has filed for both bankruptcy protection in its native Japan and in the US.

“Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC. (Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation),” wrote Karpeles

Mt. Gox has said that it has lost 750,000 bitcoins (around $412.5 million) belonging to customers, and over 100,000 bitcoins (around $55 million) of its own money. The site suddenly shut down last month after weeks of sustained DDoS attacks and “transaction malleability” problems, which led the company to halt withdrawals entirely. (That problem was finally patched on Thursday.)

As far as the purported internal documents that were released in February, Karpeles previously told Ars, “I cannot comment on documents not issued by us,” but he did not deny their authenticity.

Since then, Karpeles has not responded to Ars’ repeated requests for comment.###5582||You are using an older browser version.

Gul himself used Twitter to express criticism, by posting on his account that "shutdown was unacceptable".

On Thursday evening, Erdogan vowed to close the social network, through which a series of wiretapped conversation allegedly proving corruption in the cabinet have reached Turkish society.

Erdogan claimed that "everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic" and he did not care "what the international community says at all," as the BBC quoted him as saying. Hurriyet Daily News also reveals he expressed readiness to "eradicate" the micro-blogging platform.

Later on, Prime Minister's spokesman said the measure had been taken after the social media had failed to respond to a court ruling to remove links from the platform.

On Friday morning, millions of Twitter users reported they were unable to into their accounts, even though the ban later proved to be futile as many ways could be found to circumvent it.

In response President Gul, who had previously approved a controversial Internet bill allowing for the closure of websites by the Turkish Telecommunications Authority, said Friday that sites should be blocked if courts found that they had violated personal privacy. He also said he hoped the ban would not last long.

Earlier he also turned on Erdogan when the latter suggested he might crack down on social media to put an end to what he considers a plot against the government led by his rival Fethullah Gulen.

The EU expressed criticism at Turkey's move to shut down Twitter, with EU enlargement commissioner Stefan Fuele saying he was "gravely concerned." European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes even described the move as "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

Twitter did not immediately comment on the issue, but announced later it had hired a lawyer to negotiate with the Turkish Telecommunications Authority and discuss a possible legal solution.

Some Turkish ministers tried meanwhile to justify the move, with Forestry Minister Veysel Eroglu quoted by Hurriyet Daily as saying that blocking Twitter would ensure a more peaceful election and will prevent the spreading of "sensational and deceitful news".###5586||France provided new satellite data Sunday showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a wooden pallet that could yield clues to one of the world's most baffling aviation mysteries.

The new data consists of "radar echoes" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed what might be debris from the plane, French authorities said.

Flight 370 vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search that has turned up no confirmed pieces and nothing conclusive on what happened to the jet.

The latest satellite data came to light as Australian authorities coordinating the search, conducted about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of different lengths and colors.

The pallet was spotted on Saturday from a search plane, but the spotters were unable to take photos of it, and a PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate it could not find it.

"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center. He added: "It's a possible lead."

Wooden pallets are often used by ships, Barton cautioned. But he said airlines also commonly use them in cargo holds.

An official with Malaysia Airlines said Sunday night that the flight was, in fact, carrying wooden pallets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with company policy.

AMSA said it has requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines.

When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface, and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud," Royal Australian Air Force flight Lt. Russell Adams told reporters.

Nothing of interest was found, he said. But he added that the search was worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."

In Paris, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said in an interview with The Associated Press that the satellite radar echoes "identified some debris that could be from the Malaysian Airlines plane."

The spokesman said that these echoes "are not images with a definition like a photograph, but they do allow us to identify the nature of an object and to localize it."

"The French government has decided to increase its satellite monitoring of this zone and try to obtain precise images and locations," Nadal said.

Gathering satellite echo data involves sending a beam of energy to the Earth and then analyzing it when it bounces back, according to Joseph Bermudez Jr., chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis, a commercial satellite intelligence firm.

Satellite radar echoes can be converted into an image that would look similar to a black-and-white photo, though not as clear, he said. "You'd have to know what you're looking at," Bermudez said.

A Malaysian official involved in the search said the French data located objects about 930 kilometers (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet), said the official, who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board.

In the U.S., Tony Blinken, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, said on CNN: "There is no prevailing theory."

"Publicly or privately, we don't know" what happened to the plane, he said. "We're chasing down every theory."

The program, announced today, will begin on March 26. Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing offer, Duncan Mac Naughton, said the company was "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," a market GameStop dominates in the United States.

Walmart will accept used-game trade-ins at more than 3,100 stores in the U.S.. Trade-ins will not be accepted at the company's Sam's Club or neighborhood market locations (or where prohibited by local law) but the store credit one receives for a trade-in at a Walmart is usable at any Walmart location, or online.

Additionally, beginning this summer, Walmart will begin offering pre-owned games in its store and online. The retailer launched this ad to spread news of the program.





Walmart dabbled in used game trade-ins before, albeit through kiosks it tried out in certain stores in 2009; the plan didn't work and was discontinued. Currently Walmart accepts trade-ins of tablets, smartphones, mp3 players and other devices, but not game consoles.###5590||Australian marine authorities have detected several pieces of debris in the southern Indian Ocean that may be related to the Malaysia Airline flight that has been missing for nearly two weeks. If the debris spotted by satellites—some 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth—is conclusively linked to the plane, it would suggest the Beijing-bound flight flew for hours in the opposite direction of its intended destination.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority

Satellite photos released by the Australian government show two indistinguishable objects. Here’s one:

The area cited is roughly 6,000 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, near the limits of the distance the Boeing 777 could have flown. It’s an extremely remote stretch of ocean—situated between Australia, Antarctica, and Africa—which roughly corresponds to the southern track of the plane’s possible route, as suggested by satellite data transmitted by its engines:

In their full statement, the Australians were careful to say that the debris might not be from the plane, and that visibility in the area was poor. One of the pieces of debris was 24 meters (78 feet) long.

Four aircraft and a merchant ship are headed to the area, as well as an Australian Navy vessel that is several days away.

US officials told CNN a week ago that there was a “significant likelihood” that the plane was on the bottom of the Indian Ocean, citing information that Malaysia shared with the US.

Australia was tasked with searching the southern route that the plane might have taken—an area that covered 600,000 square kilometers of ocean, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which led the search.

On March 19, the authority released a map of a more specific area it was searching:

It also released more specific information on the flight path the plane may have taken, based on information from the US transportation officials, which helped determine the area of interest:

John Young, the head of the emergency response team at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said during a press conference: “We will continue this until we locate these objects or are convinced we cannot find them.” The AMSA “continues to hold grave concerns for the passengers and crew on board.”###5591||Wal-Mart enters the video game trade-in business now dominated by GameStop.

“We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions,” BMW’s Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company’s annual results press conference.

The Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands reiterated it aims to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

Last week BMW reported its automotive division’s fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

It's hard to be the king... err, I mean CEO.

Even if your company has a pretty spectacular year, where you finally figure out how to monetize, and the investing world rewards you handsomely for it, and then you cap it off with an historic purchase, your employees still might knock you off the top spot of beloved CEOs.

Poor Mark Zuckerberg. Last year he held the top spot on Glassdoor's list of the top 50 highest rated CEOs. Now the 2014 list was released out on Friday, and Zuck is no longer on top. He's not in the top five either. In fact, he's barely even in the top 10, falling all the way down to number nine.

His replacement as top CEO is LinkedIn's Jeff Weiner, the only one on the list to get a perfect 100% rating. (I have this vision in my head of Weiner coming up to Zuckerberg and saying, "Look at me. Look at me! I'm the captain now!" I'd give anything for that to actually happen!)

Funny enough, Weiner did not even have enough reviews to even qualify last year because he did not have enough ratings to qualifty.

These rankings are based purely on employee feedback, which was submitted from between February 1st, 2013 and January 31st 2014. At least 100 current and former employees need to have filled out surveys, hence why someone as beloved as Weiner may not make the list one year, and then top it the next.

With Weiner at number one, and Zuckerberg at number nine, who else from the tech world made the list?

Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm came in at number four, with a 95% approval rating. Last year he was down at number 8, with the same percentage. Apparently the list got a lot tougher in 2013!

Another top 10 CEO was Brad Smith of Intuit, making a big surge from number 23 on last year's list. Meanwhile, Google's Larry Page came in right behind Zuckerberg at number 10, moving up one spot from 2013.

Marc Benioff of Salesforce was given a 93% approval rating, good enough for number 12. He also moved up one spot from last year. Apple's Tim Cook went from number 18 to 17, while eBay's John Donahoe did not even make the list last year and found himself as the 19th most beloved CEO of 2013.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw a big tumble, going from 18th place, and a 93% approval rating in 2012, to 32nd place, and only 86% approval, for last year. I guess his employees hate the idea of drone delivery as much as the rest of us!

And finally, just squeaking by is Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, who only 79% of her employees like. Ouch! Sadly, Mayer is only one of two women, along with Victoria’s Secret CEO Sharen Turney, to be ranked. Last year only Turney made the list, so at least that's some progress, right? Right?

Some who made it onto last year's list, only to find themselves kicked off, are Dell CEO Michael S. Dell, Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata Consultansy Services and Krishnakumar Natarajan of Mindtree.

This is the fifth time that Glassdoor has put out the top CEO list, but there was a change made this year:the company has added a second list made up of f the top 25 CEOs leading small & mid-sized companies, meaning fewer than 1,000 employees.

Topping that list was Robert Reid of Intacct Corporation, followed by Anthony Bruce of Applied Predictive Technologies, Steve Beauchamp of Paylocity, Bill Davison of SirsiDynix and Chip Paucek of 2U.

“We find on Glassdoor that a strong leader is often one who has the ability to clearly communicate the vision for the company and who helps employees see how their work connects to the big picture. In addition, top rated CEOs are commonly seen as relatable, accessible and transparent,” Robert Hohman, Glassdoor CEO and co-founder, said in a statement to VatorNews.

“I offer my sincerest congratulations to all CEOs recognized on the 2014 Glassdoor report. It is no small feat to gain the support of your employees for your leadership.”

China released a satellite image showing an object floating in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean near where planes and ships have been crisscrossing since similar images from an Australian satellite emerged earlier in the week. China's image, showing an object that appeared to be 72 feet 43 feet, was taken around noon Tuesday.

Australian officials said the location was within the 14,000-square-mile area they searched today, but the object was not found. An Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman she did not know whether the precise coordinates of the location had been searched, but added that coordinators will use the information to refine the search area. The authority, which is overseeing the search in the region, said a civil aircraft reported seeing a number of small objects in the search area, including a wooden pallet, but a New Zealand military plane diverted to the location found only clumps of seaweed. The agency said searchers would keep trying to determine whether the objects are related to the lost plane.###5595||The euro held strong over the weekend even as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated.

The common currency traded at $1.39 at 5:45 GMT on Monday morning after economic data from the bloc supported the European Central Bank's view that the region was headed towards sustainable recovery.

The euro was resilient despite news that Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that asked the world not to recognize the Crimean vote on whether to join Russia and succeed from Ukraine. The veto highlighted the growing tension between Western leaders and Moscow as the crisis in Ukraine raged on.

On Sunday, more than 95 percent of Crimean citizens voted to join Russia in a vote that many Western leaders consider to be a violation of Ukraine's treaty as well as international law. In response, the US and Europe have said they will respond to the vote by enacting economic sanctions on Russia as early as Monday. Meanwhile, in other parts of Ukraine, pro-Russian rallies have flared up creating worries that Moscow could intervene further.

However, the euro remained supported despite the turmoil after data last week showed that the region's unemployment rate finally decreased. According to the Wall Street Journal , the EU's statistics agency reported that the number of people with jobs from October to December rose 0.1 percent to 145 million. That figure marks the first rise in eurozone employment since 2011 and added to the common currency's growing strength.

ECB President Mario Draghi expressed his concern about the rising euro last week, saying that the currency's strength could intervene in the bloc's efforts to increase inflation. Consumer prices in the region rose by just 0.8 percent in February, far below the bank's two percent target and dangerously close to deflation. Many are expecting the bank to step in and fight the region's falling inflation using monetary policy at its April meeting.

Rick Scott’s frequent raids to lure businesses from other states and even countries are paying off. He announced Monday that over a half-million jobs have been created in the last three years, as the unemployment continues to drop.

Scott said in Monday’s press release that Florida’s unemployment rate for January, 2014 was the state’s lowest since June, 2008 — 6.1 percent, 0.5 percent below the official national rate. Statewide unemployment has held below the national rate since August, 2013, and since December, 2010, Florida has created 503,500 private sector jobs.

Former Obama groupie burns her 2008 campaign T-shirt; tells off ‘criminal-in-chief’

“With the steady increase in job creation and a five percentage point drop since December 2010 bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.1 percent, it is clear we’re making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida,” Scott said in a press release. “We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow, and with more than 500,000 new private sector jobs in Florida in just over three years the progress we have made is evident. We have come a long way in three years, but let’s keep working to make sure every person who wants a job can have one.”

Every March, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases revised historical employment (jobs) and unemployment rates based on a benchmarking process to adjust the data. These benchmark revisions are mandated by BLS and take place this time every year in every state. The benchmark revisions represent an annual change in the level of employment or re-anchoring of survey estimates to actual employment counts from Reemployment Assistance tax records. This process also introduces new population inputs from the most recent Census and other revisions to economic data which leads to changes in the original estimates. The benchmarked 2013 jobs data showed that the state created more private sector jobs than were originally estimated. Nearly 200,000 new private sector jobs were added in 2013 alone.

“With a five point drop in the statewide unemployment rate and more than 500,000 new private sector jobs created since December 2010, we have another successful chapter in Florida’s economic turnaround story” Jesse Panuccio, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity said. “More Florida families are getting back to work across the state, and there is still more work to do to foster an opportunity economy for Florida’s present and future generations.”

According to New York Times, a Chinese satellite has spotted an object in the southern Indian Ocean that could be from the missing airliner. The object is close to the remote area of the ocean where a multinational search party has been looking for the Malaysia Airlines plane since the past two days.

Satellite images beamed by the China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), have spotted a large object that measures 74 feet by 24 feet (22.5 meters by 13 meters) in the ocean. The location of this object is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south west of the objects that were reported to have been sighted by a commercial satellite two days ago. According to Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein of Malaysia, Chinese ships would be sent to the location to verify if they were indeed from the Malaysia Airlines plane. SASTIND had spotted similar objects a few days ago which were later dismissed to be not from the plane.

It was on Thursday that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, revealed that an Australian commercial satellite had spotted large objects floating in a remote area in the Indian Ocean that could be from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. Since then, ships and planes combing the area were not able to find anything after two days of search. This new revelation by the Chinese authorities could be a breakthrough in what has been a depressing two weeks of search for the families and authorities. Meanwhile China has sent two military planes to Perth, where it would join other aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, USA and Japan for the massive search for the Malaysia Airlines plane.

Meanwhile, in a related Inquisitr report, we had mentioned that primary investigations by authorities which led to the unearthing of transcripts between the pilots of Malaysia Airlines and Air traffic controllers on the ground did not find anything amiss in the behavior of the pilots.

The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has become one of the most compelling mysteries in the history of aviation. The aircraft took off as a routine flight from Kula Lumpur on March 8 and was headed towards Beijing. On board the plane were 227 passengers and 12 crew members. After about two hours of normal flying, it disappeared from the radar screens that were tracking it – never to reappear again. Meanwhile the plane continued to ping an ACARS Inmarsat satellite for over 8 hours after its disappearance. The Rolls Royce manufactured engines from the Boeing 777 were designed to send reports to the UK monitoring center on a periodic basis using the satellite.

Do you think there is any chance that the Malaysia Airlines plane could have landed in some remote area of the planet where authorities haven’t looked at yet?

Bank Rossiya, used by close associates of President Vladimir Putin, said in a statement that Visa and MasterCard had "without warning stopped providing its payment services to the bank's clients."

An affiliate bank, Sobinbank, which is 100%-controlled by Bank Rossiya, was also affected.

Bank Rossiya was hit by a fresh wave of Washington sanctions announced yesterday, which also targeted several billionaire businessmen believed to be close to Putin.

Clients of the banks are now unable to use their credit cards to make purchases or to withdraw money from cash machines not belonging to the banks.

SMP Bank, which is controlled by brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg who were among those blacklisted, also said its clients were unable to make Visa and MasterCard payments.

How business may ultimately shape the Ukraine crisis

US President Barack Obama yesterday said the list of Russians targeted by sanctions had been extended to include oligarchs and bankers believed to be close to Putin, including Gennady Timchenko and Yuri Kovalchuk.

Bank Rossiya was listed separately as a target for sanctions.

Americans and American businesses, such as Visa and MasterCard, are forbidden from any dealings with anyone targetted by the sanctions and any assets they might have in the US are frozen.

Putin responded today by vowing to open an account at Bank Rossiya on Monday.

SMP Bank said in a statement that it believed the move was "unlawful" because the sanctions targeted not the bank but its shareholders.

None of the banks affected have a major high-street presence, but Bank Rossiya is used by companies within Gazprom energy giant to pay salaries to staff, the Interfax news agency reported.

Russia's central bank said in a statement about Bank Rossiya that "the operations that come under sanctions are not having a significant impact on the financial stability of the credit organisation".

"If necessary suitable measures will be taken to support the credit organisation and give reliable protection of the interests of its account holders and creditors," Russia's central bank added.###5603||Empty###5604||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

The ruling issued Friday by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a lower court’s decision in July that favored the merchants and was a setback for banks.

In the July ruling, a federal judge struck down the Fed’s cap on so-called “swipe fees,” saying the Fed didn’t have the authority to set the limit the way it did in 2011, improperly including data that made the cap too high.

The retail groups had sued the Fed over its setting the cap at an average of about 24 cents per debit-card transaction. The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.

Congress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.

The retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.

The three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.

The National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.

“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”

The Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.

The banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Hunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”

“Make no doubt about it – consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.

The American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.

The fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.

Banks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.

Banks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.

The retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.

The Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, a big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop, based on an industry fixed-rate system that allowed lower rates for companies with bigger customer volume. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.

The Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.###5606||New objects have been located in the Australian search are in the search for flight MH370. Courtesy: Sky News

THE missing Malaysia Airlines plane went down in the Indian Ocean presumably killing all those on board, authorities said after viewing new satellite data.

Malaysia Airlines has informed the relatives of those aboard missing flight MH370 that they believe no one on the plane survived.

The following SMS message was sent to relatives: “Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived. ... we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a 1am AEDT news conference that a new analysis of satellite data showed that the missing plane plunged into the southern Indian Ocean.

Mr Najib said the Inmarsat satellite company had employed never-before used technology and found that MH370 flew along the southern corridor.

“Its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean west of Perth,” he said 17 days after MH370 disappeared enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board.

“This is a remote location far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness that I regret that I must inform you that according to this new data that MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.

“The past few weeks have been heartbreaking. I know this news must be harder still.”

The news was greeted with an outpouring of grief by the relatives of passengers, whose agonising wait to find out what happened is now apparently over.

Relatives of Chinese passengers, who were the overwhelming majority of those on the plane, were called to a hotel near the airport in Beijing to hear the announcement. Afterward, they filed out of a conference room in heart-wrenching grief.

One woman collapsed and fell on her knees, crying “My son! My son!”

The overnight developments came after Prime Minster Tony Abbott announced that two “objects” were located by a RAAF P3 Orion in the search for MH370.

Mr Abbott told Parliament the first object was grey or green and circular and the second was orange and rectangular.

Distraught family members of those on board were being booked on charter flights to take them to Perth to be near the expected salvage operation.

News_Image_File: Bearer of bad news ... Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak after his press conference.

HMAS Success is in the vicinity of the possible debris, about 2500km southwest of Perth, and hopes to be there within hours to recover the objects.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority emergency response division general manager John Young said the P3 Orion had to leave before the HMAS Success arrived last night and it was possible the ship would have to wait until the first light of morning to find the objects.

MH370 WAS CO-PILOT’S FIRST 777 FLIGHT WITHOUT MINDER

“Relocation is proving difficult. That is partially a function of the poor visibility and the fact that the aircraft are a long way apart. It is quite difficult to get the next aircraft or the next ship into the spot to take over the watching where the object is because they are all at the end of their endurance and have to leave,” he said.

“You may find that we will be doing this for maybe three or four more days before we are confident that we have either found all of the objects there, or if they are there we simply can’t find them. And that’s the plan.”

News_Image_File: Searching for answers ... HMAS Success is nearby and will be there within hours to recover the objects.

Earlier in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein had told a media conference that the new items had not yet been identified or linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

“Two orange objects, approximately one metre in length, and one white-coloured drum were sighted by search aircraft, but remain unidentified and have not been conclusively linked to MH370,” he said.

News_Image_File: On the way ... the commanding officer of HMAS Success, Captain Allison Norris of the Royal Australian Navy.

“HMAS Success detected two radar targets within the search area but could not locate the targets on further investigation of the area.

“Earlier today a Chinese search plane reportedly sighted objects within the Australian search area. These objects are not in the vicinity of those that were identified by Australian authorities last week.

HMAS SUCCESS CAPTAIN STEERS SHIP THROUGH HOSTILE SEAS

“A few minutes ago the (Malaysian) Prime Minister received a call from the Prime Minister of Australia who informed him that an Australian search aircraft had located two objects in the Australian search area — one circular and one rectangular.

“HMAS Success is in the vicinity and it is possible that the objects could be received within the next few hours or by tomorrow morning at the latest.”

News_Image_File: Items located ... Malaysian PM Najib Razak takes the call from Tony Abbott.

Mr Abbott said an RAAF P3 Orion located the two objects about 2.45pm AEDT.

The PM said a US Navy Poseidon, a second Australian Royal Australian Orion and a Japanese Orion are also en route to the search area.

“I caution again ... that we don’t know whether any of these objects are from MH370, they could be flotsam,’’ he told Parliament.

“Nevertheless we are hopeful that we can recover these objects soon and they will take us a step closer to resolving this tragic mystery.’’

News_Image_File: On a mission ... Prime Minister Tony Abbott says a US Navy Poseidon, a second Australian Royal Australian Orion and a Japanese Orion are also on the way to the search area.

Hishammuddin said Malaysian police have interviewed over 100 people, including the families of both the pilot and co-pilot.

“As far as the transcript is concerned, the technical committee is considering releasing it and we will keep you informed about the decision,” he said.

“The Inspector General of the Police will attend tomorrow’s press conference to answer further questions on the investigation.

“We can also confirm that MH370 was carrying wooden pallets. However, there is as yet no evidence that these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the Australian search area.”

Hishammuddin said France has now provided two lots of images of potential debris from MH370.

EXPERTS SAY NEW FINDINGS ‘COULD BE LIFE RAFTS’

Paul Edwards, former chief of staff of British Army Aviation, told Britain’s Sky News the sightings were “quite significant”.

“It is certainly encouraging because of the shape, because of the colour orange obviously, it could be from the aircraft.

“The good news is that the aircraft has spotted it and surface ships are in the area which means that quite quickly we’re going to get an Australian warship alongside to get eyes on it, and actually identify it and — if it’s small — fish it out of the sea. To me that’s quite a significant development and very encouraging.

“(As it’s only been) a short time, there’s more chance of getting there and, crucially, actually identifying it.”

News_Image_File: Duty ... Leading Seaman Luke Horsburgh stands watch on the bridge of HMAS Success during the search for MH370.

Professor Chris Bellamy, from Britain’s Greenwich Maritime Institute, said the orange items could possibly be life rafts.

“I’m afraid that doesn’t give much hope that there will be anybody in the life rafts. If the plane broke up then the slides might have inflated automatically,” he told Sky News UK.

“We’re against the clock here because in the 16 or 17 days since the plane disappeared that stuff could have gone an awfully long way.”

The development comes after Chinese aircrew earlier spotted objects in the search area off Perth.

News_Image_File: Hunt for clues ... the families of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his co-pilot Fariq Hamad have been interviewed, say Malaysian officials. Picture: YouTubeThe official Xinhua news agency said earlier on Monday that “white and square” objects were spotted by searchers on board a Chinese Ilyushin-76 plane, which was on its way back to Perth at the time of the sighting.

US Navy P8 Poseidon was unable to relocate the objects after it was tasked to investigate the reported sightings by the Chinese aircraft at 33,000ft.

At the request of the RAAF, one Australian pilot was on board the Chinese plane to join the search.

Chinese icebreaker Xuelong changed its course and was heading towards the area.

Multiple countries are now helping in the search with new satellite images pushing the Australian-led operation towards further areas of potential debris.

Civil and military aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, the US, China and Japan are all taking part in the massive hunt for the Malaysia Airlines plane, which disappeared more than 16 days ago with 239 people on board.

After a fruitless day of searching yesterday, satellite images from France provided some fresh impetus. They were reportedly taken on Friday although few details have been released.

“Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor. Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre,” the transport ministry said in a statement in Kuala Lumpur.

While the statement from Malaysia called the information “new satellite images’’, France’s Foreign Ministry said they were “radar echoes”. It is thought the radar echoes — electronic signals — had been converted into fuzzy images.

PLANE FLEW AS LOW AS 3650 METRES BEFORE VANISHING

New evidence supports previous eyewitness accounts that the missing Malaysian airliner flew as low as 3650 metres over Malaysia before it vanished.

Military radar tracking showed the plane changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea and headed back over the peninsula towards the Straits of Malacca, according to a source close to the investigation, CNN reports.

The Boeing 777 with 239 people on board flew as low as 3650 metres feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source.

Malaysian authorities have not confirmed the CNN report.

‘PALLET’ MYSTERY

So far there has been nothing concrete found, only the grainy satellite images and a visual sighting of what appeared to be a wooden pallet which has yet to be located.

Authorities co-ordinating the search yesterday sent planes and a ship to try to “re-find’’ the pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours.

It was seen Saturday by spotters on a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate it could not find it.

News_Image_File: Objects ... satellite imagery from AMSA.

“That’s the nature of it,’’ AMSA aircraft operations co-ordinator Mike Barton said. “You only have to be off by a few hundred metres in a fast-travelling aircraft.’’

AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.

“We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry,’’ Mr Barton said. “They’re usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft ... It’s a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well.”

News_Image_File: More data ... the Chinese satellite image.

During a visit to Papua New Guinea, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the satellite images were good leads but it was “still too early to be definite”.

“But obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope — no more than hope, no more than hope — that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,” he said.

LARGE FLOATING OBJECTS

On Saturday it was revealed that a Chinese satellite had picked up what appeared to be a floating object, about 22.5 metres by 13 metres. It was seen about 120km from the position where an Australian satellite image showed what also appeared to be debris of about 24 metres in length.

News_Image_File: On the lookout ... Japan’s P-3C Orion arrives to help in the search. Pic: Jason Reed.

One of the objects located by the French satellite on Friday was estimated to be about the same size as the object captured by the Chinese satellite (22 metres by 13 metres), according to a Malaysian official, who declined to be identified because he isn’t authorised to speak to the media.

It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

The Australian image was taken on March 16 and the Chinese image was taken on March 18.

Authorities have not yet officially revealed what date the French image was taken or what it showed.

News_Image_File: First light ... a Japanese P-3C Orion readies to join the search.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled.

They are unsure what happened next.

‘MYSTERY CALL’ DENIED

Malaysian police have denied that a mystery phone call was made to Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the missing plane.

It was reported earlier that a mystery woman called the captain before takeoff, raising fears about his motives.

The Mail Online reported that the captain’s phone records revealed he took a two-minute phone call from a woman using a mobile phone number obtained under a false identity.

But Assistant Commissioner Datin Asmawati Ahmad dismissed the report as “mere speculations”.

“Please be advised that the Royal Malaysia Police take no responsibility over the dissemination of such information which originates from unnamed and unverified sources. The news in the tabloid are mere speculations,” Asst Comm Ahmad said in a statement.

“We would like to draw your kind attention to the fact that the news was picked up from a foreign tabloid which has no exclusive rights to the details of our investigations.

“Secondly the IGP has never issued any public statement that categorically places the MH370 investigation under an act of terrorism.”

RELATIVES STILL FURIOUS

Earlier in Beijing, a Malaysian Government team had spent a marathon six hours briefing relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on the plane. It was the third meeting and comes after criticism by Chinese relatives that they were being kept in the dark about the search.

“The government wishes to reiterate its commitment and continued engagement with the relatives of those on board MH370,” the Transport Ministry said.

Some relatives were still dissatisfied, however.

“I’m so furious,’’ said one woman after the meeting in Beijing. “I watch the television every day. Very often I feel like I’m about to go insane. My emotions are all over the place. I asked the Malaysians to give the answers and they said they couldn’t.”

This weekend’s Formula One grand prix in Malaysia is also causing problems, with relatives of passengers on the missing flight forced to move hotels.

New French satellite images show possible debris from a missing Malaysian airliner deep in the southern Indian Ocean, Malaysia said March 23, adding to growing signs that the plane may have gone down in remote seas off Australia.The latest lead came as the international search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace of the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board.“This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor,” the Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement. “Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination center.”Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said there was “increasing hope” of a breakthrough in the hunt for the plane on the strength of Chinese and Australian satellite images of possible large debris in the southern search area.The French Foreign Ministry said radar echoes from a satellite put the new debris finding about 2,300 km from Perth, without giving a direction or a date.The debris in the Australian image was about 2,500 km southwest of Perth and the Chinese sighting, captured two days later, was around 120 km “south by west” of that.An international force resumed its search efforts March 23, zeroing in on two areas around where the sightings were made in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris, including a wooden pallet, spotted by a search plane on March 22.China said the object it had seen on the satellite image was 22 meters long and 13 meters wide, floating in some of the most inhospitable sea territory on Earth.It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same as those detected by Australia, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, said a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search.###5608||Empty###5609||Empty###5610||Most of the passengers of flight MH0318, which now flies the route to Beijing taken by missing flight MH0370, have fallen asleep after the snack service at 2 a.m., March 22, 2014.

The night sky was clear above the clouds, and the last glimmer of a setting half-moon had faded when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, cruising at 35,000 feet over the Gulf of Thailand, approached the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace on its usual route to Beijing. What happened next should have been routine for a twice-daily milk run between two of Asia's most important cities. Air traffic controllers outside Kuala Lumpur usually hand the jet off to their counterparts in Ho Chi Minh City as the flight turns northeast toward the Chinese capital.But in those early hours of March 8, pilots flying nearby heard an unusual crescendo of chatter on the radio frequencies used by radar control in Vietnam and Malaysia. Air traffic personnel in both countries were trying and failing to reach the plane."Any stations in contact with Malaysian 370, please relay."Vietnamese and Malaysian controllers asked one aircraft after another to radio the jet. Pilots listened as one plane after another tried and heard only static."Malaysian 370, this is Malaysian 88.""Malaysian 370, this is Malaysian 52."People familiar with the calls, describing them for the first time, said they were calm, even laconic. The pilots trying to reach the airliner had no reason to believe it had suffered anything more than an ordinary radio malfunction. But those initial attempts to find a plane in the skies would soon evolve into an urgent multinational search operation spanning land and sea in two hemispheres. They signaled the start of what has become perhaps the most perplexing case in modern aviation - one that investigators say may take years to solve, or could remain a mystery forever.More than two weeks after Flight 370 disappeared, unbridled speculation surrounds the unfolding global drama. So much is uncertain about what happened on the plane, and so much of what has been disclosed by Malaysian authorities has been contradicted, that hardly any theory of its fate can be easily dismissed. On Saturday, the authorities said a Chinese satellite had made a new sighting of a possible object floating in the southern Indian Ocean in the area that is now the focus of the search, and China was sending ships to investigate.Based on dozens of interviews with people whose lives were touched by the plane as well as with outside experts and investigators from the two dozen countries searching for answers, this report presents a portrait of Flight 370 and the search to find it using what is known to date. But by necessity, it is an incomplete picture.Malaysia Airlines flies from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing twice daily, nonstop. The red-eye, departing at 12:35 a.m. and landing at 6:30 a.m., can carry a hodgepodge of travelers: vacationing Malaysian families, European businessmen pursuing deals, Chinese tourists returning home after visiting relatives or shopping.Passengers are advised to arrive at least two hours in advance. On March 7, a delegation of 34 Chinese artists, relatives and organizers who had spent the past several days participating in an art exhibit in Kuala Lumpur played it safe with the city's unpredictable Friday night traffic and arrived about 8 p.m.Perhaps the most prominent of the artists was the flight's oldest passenger, Liu Rusheng, 77, a calligrapher who had published an essay about how much he treasured life because he had "cheated death" six times, beginning when he was abandoned temporarily by his parents as they fled Japanese soldiers invading China.Liu had "the energy of a young man," recalled Daniel Liau, the delegation's host, who accompanied the travelers to the airport and helped them check their luggage. They stood chatting under the modernist scalloped ceilings of the main terminal for about 90 minutes. Later, after the group had passed through security and taken the monorail to the satellite terminal, Liau called them one last time."How are the artists?" he recalled asking one of the organizers, Hou Bo, who replied they had already reached the gate. "Everybody is OK," Hou assured him.Boarding began about midnight. The airline would have allowed the elderly - including Liu and his wife, Bao Yuanhua, 73 - and the families traveling with the two infants booked on the flight to get settled first. Next came the passengers holding passes for the 35 seats in business class.Philip Wood, 50, an IBM executive from Texas and a regular on the flight because he was relocating from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur, was in coach but hoped to be upgraded. He had long legs and a platinum frequent-flier card, said his partner, Sarah Bajc, 48, a teacher.Bajc said she exchanged a dozen text messages with him before the flight about the movers, scheduled to arrive at their home in Beijing the next morning. "We discussed the state of packing, what still needed to be done," she said. His last message came just before he left for the airport.Others on the flight were just passing through Kuala Lumpur, including Shi Xianwen, 26, a new father returning to China from a business trip to Australia. At the airport in Perth, he spent 40 minutes picking out a bracelet watch for his wife, whose birthday was approaching, an employee at the duty-free shop said.And two passengers boarded using stolen passports: Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, 19, and Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, Iranian men described by Interpol as migrants being smuggled into Europe.Mohammad Mallaeibasir, 18, an information technology student in Kuala Lumpur, said the pair stayed in his apartment the night before they left. Mehrdad, a friend from high school in Tehran, he said, told him he was starting a new life in Hamburg, Germany, where his mother was waiting."He was quite nervous," Mallaeibasir recalled. "I could see it on his face."The next night, he drove them to the airport and offered to help them check in, but they insisted on entering separately, Delavar first. The two high school buddies waited in the car for five to 10 minutes, smoking cigarettes, before Mehrdad got out to leave.Mallaeibasir gave him a hug, told him to have a safe flight and watched as his friend carried a large backpack and a laptop computer bag into the terminal. That was the last he saw of him.The plane the passengers boarded was a Boeing 777, one of the world's most popular and advanced passenger jets, and Boeing's first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, in which electronic controls replaced manual ones. Pilots send commands that are conveyed to the wings and other components, and a computer helps keep the plane steady.The "Triple Seven," as it often called, has all but replaced the 747 because it is cheaper to operate and can fly up to 16 hours without stopping to refuel. It also has one of the industry's best safety records, with only two serious accidents in the 19 years it has been in service.Malaysia Airlines, the nation's state-run carrier, began using the Boeing 777 in 1997 and eventually had 15 in its fleet. One of them, the 404th model to roll off Boeing's assembly line in Everett, Wash., was delivered to the airline in May 2002 and registered with tail number 9M-MRO. This was the plane used for Flight 370 that has disappeared.Malaysia Airlines has said the jet has been involved in only one previous safety incident. On Aug. 9, 2012, the tip of one of its wings broke off after it clipped the tail of a China Eastern Airlines AirbusA340 while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. No one was hurt. Boeing said it sent a team of engineers and mechanics to remove and replace the damaged wing sections, and returned the plane to service after testing.Boeing recommends a light maintenance inspection of the 777 after about 500 hours of flight time. Known as an "A check," the inspection usually is conducted in a hangar by a team of about 15 engineers working about 10 hours, often overnight. Malaysia Airlines said the jet's last "A check" took place Feb. 23, and uncovered no problems.By the time it pulled up to the gate at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8, the plane had completed more than 7,500 flights and clocked over 53,400 hours in the air, according to Flightglobal, a news and data service for the aviation sector. That put it well within the average economic life of 23 years for a wide-body passenger jet.In other words, there was little to distinguish this plane from the roughly 1,170 other Boeing 777s now in use. That is why it is so crucial to determine if the plane's disappearance was due to any malfunction or defect related to its design, build or engineering."The industry does not like uncertainty," said Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. "We will find out what happened."As they stepped on to the plane, the 227 passengers of Flight 370 were greeted by the flight attendants, four women in sarong kebayas and six men in gray three-piece suits. Some distributed hand towels, juice and newspapers in business class; others helped those in economy find their seats.Outside, ground crews loaded the passenger luggage into the jet's cargo hold, which can carry up to six pallets and 14 shipping containers. The airline said no hazardous or valuable goods were on the flight. But among the cargo were a "significant" number of lithium batteries - which can be flammable - more than is typically sent in a shipment, one U.S. official said.After the doors closed, the chief steward, Andrew Nari, would have welcomed the passengers via the loudspeaker and reminded them to turn off their cellphones. Before shutting off his own, he sent a message to his mother. "It was just a normal SMS telling me that his plane would fly off soon," she later told The Star, a local newspaper.In the cockpit were the pilots: the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, who joined the airline in 1981 and had 18,365 hours of flying experience, and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was transitioning to the Boeing 777 from the airline's narrow-body fleet.After nudging away from the gate, the plane taxied to runway 32R. The cabin lights would have dimmed before one of the pilots asked the crew to be seated for takeoff.With two Rolls-Royce Trent engines, each capable of generating more than 92,000 pounds of thrust, the jet raced down the 2.5-mile-long runway and lifted off at 41 minutes after midnight. As the plane banked and climbed, some passengers might have spotted the glow of Kuala Lumpur and perhaps the Petronas Towers in the distance.At 1:07 a.m., as the jet approached the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, ground crews received what the authorities have described as a routine text message from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, which sends regular updates on the condition of the plane by radio or satellite.By then, the first beverage service of the flight was most likely underway - soft drinks, juice and peanuts in economy; in business, various drinks, including Champagne, along with a snack such as charcoal-grilled chicken and lamb satay in peanut sauce. The in-flight entertainment system offered a wide selection of movies.Air traffic control in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, followed the plane by tracking its transponder, a device that "squawks" or emits an identifying signal in response to a signal from radar. The night began with Flight 370 squawking code 2157 and reporting altitude, speed and bearing.As the plane approached Vietnamese airspace, Subang informed the pilots that they were being transferred to radar control in Ho Chi Minh City. At 1:19 a.m., a voice identified by the authorities as that of the first officer, Fariq, replied, "All right, good night."Two minutes later, Flight 370's transponder stopped responding. It is unclear whether someone turned a dial on an instrument panel between the pilot and co-pilot and put the transponder in standby mode, or whether a malfunction caused it to go quiet.One moment, radar scopes showed the plane traveling northwest at 471 knots (542 mph). The next moment, it was gone.The military in Vietnam marked the time at 43 seconds past 1:20 a.m.As air traffic controllers struggled to re-establish contact with Flight 370, military radar at the Butterworth air force base on Malaysia's west coast picked up an unidentified aircraft near where the plane disappeared.But the watch team, normally an officer and three enlisted personnel, either failed to notice the signal or decided not to designate and track it as a "zombie," which would have pushed the information up the chain of command and possibly alerted air command.At a briefing on the base the next night, about 80 air force personnel were told there was "no proof" the unidentified signal showed the missing plane making a sharp turn, flying back across PeninsularMalaysia and then turning again and heading northwest over the Strait of Malacca, a person familiar with the situation said.But investigators now believe that is exactly what happened.The failure to recognize Flight 370 in the radar data - or refusal to do so, to avoid the embarrassment of admitting an unidentified plane had breached air defense - meant the Malaysian authorities continued to search in the seas to the east instead of the west of the peninsula. Military radar last recorded the signal at 2:22 a.m., about 200 nautical miles northwest of Butterworth, according to an image of the radar track.The authorities also failed to move quickly on data that showed the plane continuing to fly nearly seven more hours: a series of regular handshake signals from the plane to a satellite seeking to determine if the aircraft was still in range.Chris McLaughlin, a vice president at Inmarsat, the satellite communications firm, said technicians pulled the logs of all transmissions from the plane within four hours of its disappearance. Then, after a day without sign of the plane, they began scouring the company's databases for any trace of Flight 370."We decided to go have another look at our network to see if there was any data that we had missed," McLaughlin said. It turned out there was. Inmarsat technicians identified what appeared to be a series of fleeting "pings" between Flight 370, a satellite over the Indian Ocean and a ground station in Perth, Australia.The signals - seven of them transmitted at one-hour intervals - were an important clue, because they could have come only from an antenna receiving power from the plane itself. But while they carried a unique code identifying the aircraft as Flight 370, the signals contained no positioning or other data that could indicate where the plane was when it sent them.By Sunday afternoon, a team of Inmarsat engineers set to work using the principles of trigonometry to determine the distance between the satellite and the plane at the time of each ping, and then to calculate two rough flight paths. The plane, they concluded, had turned again. But it may have then traveled in more or less a straight line, heading north over countries likely to have picked it up on radar, or south toward the Indian Ocean and Antarctica.The Malaysian government said it received Inmarsat's data on March 12 and spent three days analyzing and vetting it with investigators from the United States before redirecting the search on March 15.By then, more than a week had passed since the last satellite ping, recorded at 8:11 a.m. on March 8. It appears to have come from over the southern Indian Ocean, halfway around the world from where the plane should have been, on a tarmac in Beijing.###5611||





Ankara has found the internet difficult to silence over allegations of corruption. Hours after Turkey’s government moved to block access to Twitter, Turkish citizens struck back – on the social media network itself.

Some circulated a manipulated picture of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, sinking his teeth into the blue bird that serves as the network’s mascot. They were not alone: the number of tweets sent after the midnight ban rose 140 per cent over normal levels, according to data provided by analytics firm Brandwatch.



Dodging the ban

Twitter sent out mobile numbers that allowed Turkish consumers to keep using its service. In another technical fix against the ban, Turkish downloads of Hotspot Shield, the world’s most popular virtual private network service, rose to 270,000 on Friday – from a daily average of 7,000.

The Turkish users’ defiance and the sheer scale of their activity suggest no immediate end to the battering Mr Erdogan has suffered in cyberspace.

Seeking to silence allegations of corruption against him and his government in the run-up to local elections on March 30th, he has removed some 7,000 policemen from their posts and boosted Ankara’s powers over judges and prosecutors.

But the internet has proved harder to handle. A formal corruption investigation has stalled, Twitter and YouTube have been used to circulate apparently incriminating voice recordings of Mr Erdogan and his circle – including some he has acknowledged as authentic.

Yet more explosive leaks are expected ahead of this month’s elections – according to one rumour, more revelations will come on March 25th.

But if Turkey’s Twitter ban was intended to thwart the dissemination of such allegations, it has backfired spectacularly.

“Erdogan is constantly on the run now. I don’t think he has time to think,” said Soli Ozel at Kadir Has university in Istanbul. “He is trying to keep the scandal as muted as possible at all costs, but he can’t control the technology. Instead, he is fuelling the fire of suspicion and making everyone anticipate what, if anything, will come out on the 25th.”

Mr Erdogan took aim at Twitter, saying he would “root out” the microblogging service for national security reasons. But he failed to account for Turkey’s predilection for social networks – a response, many say, to a cowed media – which means Twitter has greater penetration among web users here than in any other country.

Even President Abdullah Gul, who signed a Bill increasing government control over the internet, tweeted his opposition to the measure.



Free speech

Before long, the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the UK government, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and many other non-governmental and international bodies had sent tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech. Celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Richard Branson, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood piled in.

The Turkish bar association filed a criminal complaint against the ban, which it said was illegal. As sporadic Twitter service returned, mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure, supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy.

The government says it was done as Twitter had failed to respect such court complaints; a lawyer for Twitter was in Ankara for meetings yesterday.

“These steps are very crucial for the Turkish legal system,” said Selin Erciyas, at Mehmet Gun & Partners, an Istanbul law firm. “We will see if there is a true objective legal system or whether it is just Erdogan that decides things in court.”

Payroll provider ADP reported that the state added 11,610 private sector jobs in January and 10,840 additional jobs during the month of February. ADP's survey is separate from the one that is conducted by government agencies.



Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.



But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

Today the UK Royal Mint has unveiled the new £1 coin that has been in development for some time and now includes new security features such as a bi-metalic construction and a 12 sided two colour design.

The new £1 coin also includes the Royal Mint’s new iSIS technology, or Integrated Secure Identification System. The iSIS technology comprises of three tiers of banknote-strength security enabling the coin to be authenticated using high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle reducing the likelihood of forgeries slipping into the cash system.

A public design competition for the new £1 coin will be held at a later date to choose the design for the reverse, or ‘tails’, of the coin. The new £1 coin is expected to be introduced in 2017.

“The new £1 coin also pays a fitting tribute to Britain’s heritage. It is the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny bit, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971.

The threepenny bit was in the first group of coins ever to feature the portrait of HRH Queen Elizabeth II.

The new version coined in 1953 bore a design of a Tudor chained portcullis, which was inherited by the 1p piece after decimalisation and remains on the coin today, as well as being the badge of the Palace of Westminster.

The threepenny bit was the first British coin to use a 12-sided shape which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War, as its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during the blackout.

By the time of decimalisation 1.2 billion had been issued for circulation.”

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals###5618||Hospitality startup Airbnb has seen more than 11 million guests stay on the platform since being launched in 2007, which has led to some enthusiasm among investors. The company has already raised more than $300 million in funding, but the WSJ reports Airbnb is in “advanced talks” to raise an additional $400 million to $500 million.

With that report as a backdrop, Airbnb has shared some stats this morning that show its guests increasingly are traveling to, from, or in-between nations in Europe. In a blog post today, the company said that 50 percent of its guests over the last year were from Europe, and that number is only expected to grow over time.

Airbnb said that more than a million guests each from the U.K. and France have booked stays through its platform. Meanwhile, more than a million guests have stayed at places listed on Airbnb in both Italy and Spain. It’s likely that those guests and stays overlapped quite a bit — according to the company, more than 80 percent of European guests staying with Airbnb traveled to other destinations within Europe.

The growth comes as Airbnb has been investing in the continent over recent years — in 2012, the company opened offices in London, Paris, Barcelona, and Milan, among other European cities.

Airbnb has had a particularly international audience for a while, with three-quarters of all stays involving a stay by an international guest or a guest staying in an international listing. But this announcement marks a serious shift in the makeup of Airbnb guests. Back in 2011, about half of all guests were from the U.S., but that’s dropped to below 30 percent.

That said, the company expects its growth in Europe to accelerate even further. It forecasts that the number of European guests staying in unique listings will more than double in 2014.

That’s great news for a company that had already shown impressive growth in 2013 — seeing its overall stays jump from a total of 4 million at the beginning of the year to 11 million by the end of it.

Airbnb’s valuation is also seeing a big increase, according to the WSJ. Its last funding round of $200 million led by Founders Fund valued it at $2.5 billion, while the latest raise, which is expected to include private-equity firm TPG, values the company at around $10 billion.

For what it’s worth, Airbnb declined to comment on the report of new funding.###5619||Empty###5620||Empty###5621||Thank you for Reading.

The move shows the heat hasn’t gone out of mobile and social messaging just yet.

Alibaba is understood to have contributed US$215m to the round. The investment values the Silicon Valley start-up at around US$1bn.

So far, Tango has raised US$367m in funding from DFJ, Qualcomm and Yahoo! co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang.

Tango allows users to send free text messages, photos and video messages over their phones.

It also has something of its own social network in the making, where users can send updates and play games.

Tango has so far attracted more than 200m users, more than double its user base a year ago.

It is estimated that about 70m people log into the app on a weekly basis. Its users are typically aged between 25 and 45.

Vision of the founders

Tango was forged in 2009 by CEO Uri Raz and CTO Eric Setton, initially as a competitor to Apple’s FaceTime. However, it quickly realised it could provide an alternative by breaking beyond the confines of iOS and embracing Android, as well.

“We launched Tango in September 2009 out of the personal need to stay connected to our own families,” the founders wrote in their blog.

“It helped tremendously that both of us came from deep video technology backgrounds and had strong entrepreneurial spirits. But it was the emotional connection with family living in other parts of the world that inspired our mission here at Tango. Back then we felt that free online communication through texts, voice and video calls would remove barriers and change the world. The world agreed: we signed up our first million members in the first 10 days after launch.”

The platform has evolved to allow users to communicate around photos, music, voice and video messages, as well as video games.

It has even created its own SDK for developers to create Tango-powered games.

“While we’ve made progress on our mission to enable people to communicate, share and feel more connected, we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible. The opportunity for Tango goes well beyond just providing a messaging app for free communications. We see an even bigger opportunity – one where people can have access to free communication, social networking features and enjoyable content – all within a single platform.

“Over the past eight months, Tango has evolved. We’ve introduced a content platform that is now home to more than 30 games. We’ve introduced new social networking features that allow members to share updates or photos and to find new friends. And we’ve introduced social music sharing through integration with Spotify, which means members can now send each other songs.

“Quite honestly, the results have blown us away. We’re excited by the 2x increase in daily engagement since last July. And we love it that our members are huge fans of music and love to send hundreds of millions of songs to their friends through Tango. These changes are reflected in huge growth in registered users: over the last year we’ve doubled to more than 200m,” Raz and Setton said.###5628||Empty###5629||Empty###5630||The Norweigen merchant transport ship Hoegh St. Petersburg, which has been diverted to take part in the search for possible MH370 debris is seen from a Royal Australian Airforce AP-3C Orion from Pearce Airforce Base on March 21, 2014 in Perth, Australia.

Malaysia said Saturday that a Chinese satellite had spotted a large object along a broad stretch of ocean where officials hope to find a Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing for more than two weeks.

Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted an object 74 feet by 43 feet.

‘‘The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify,’’ he said.

State broadcaster CCTV tweeted an image of the object and said it was captured around noon Tuesday, about 75 miles south of another satellite image that was taken days earlier of two objects in the water.

Planes and ships have been searching the area of the earlier discovery for three days but have found nothing so far. Flight 370 went missing March 8 shortly after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

After about a week of confusion, authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777 for several hours after it disappeared from air traffic control screens indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia up to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Three Australian planes took off at dawn Saturday for a third day of scouring a desolate stretch of the southern Indian Ocean for possible parts of the missing plane.

Officials are still cautioning the search will be a protracted operation, with Minister Hussein saying searchers were facing a "long haul."

Efforts by more than two dozen countries have thus far failed to uncover conclusive evidence as to what happened to the jet, with the apparent slow progress leading to frustration and fresh questions. Searches on Friday proved fruitless, despite improved weather conditions from a day earlier.

Also on Friday, a purported transcript of the final conversations between the pilots of the plane and air traffic controllers was published by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. They appear to show the last 54 minutes of air-to-ground recordings for Flight 370.

The log ends with the words "All right, good night," believed to have been spoken by the missing plane's co-pilot before the cockpit's contact to air traffic control was severed.

A satellite spotted two large objects in the area earlier this week, raising hopes of finding the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Six aircraft and two merchant ships were scouring the area on Saturday, although Australian officials have cautioned the objects, one up to 72 feet in length, may not be related to the missing aircraft or might have sunk.

A small flotilla of ships from China is expected to arrive in the next few days.

Officials with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority were also checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information. The images that led to the focus on the southern Indian Ocean were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them.

Meanwhile, Malaysia has asked the U.S. for undersea surveillance equipment to help in the search, according to the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to assess the availability of the technology and its usefulness in the search, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said.

The Pentagon says it has spent $2.5 million to operate ships and aircraft in the search and has budgeted another $1.5 million for the efforts.###5631||Empty###5632||It's a big day for the chancellor George Osborne. Not only has he got to deliver his budget, but the clever old chap has diverted headlines by announcing there'll be a new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit.

It is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Ooh.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

That's enough about the coin and it's 12 sides. We are more interested in the other sides to the chancellor, so here we go...###5633||By Sneha Shankar - A combined review done by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, into the airplane maker's pioneering 787 Dreamliner, has concluded that its design and manufacture are sound.

According to the report released Wednesday, the FAA had ordered a review of the planes last year, after grounding the entire fleet following a series of problems with onboard batteries. The report said that some Boeing suppliers did not follow the right industry standards for quality control but added that “effective processes” had been put in place since then to correct the problem.

“The CSRT (Critical Systems Review Team) determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane’s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification,” the report said.

The report also concluded that the FAA should increase its supervision of foreign and "high-risk" subcontractor facilities and recommended that Boeing should ensure its suppliers "are fully aware of their responsibilities" and formulate a way to ensure that they "identify realistic program risk."

Although Illinois-based Boeing’s 787 is reportedly one of the most advanced planes in the market, it has been hit with a series of problems that have cast doubts on the plane’s airworthiness. Many of the company's customers, including Qatar Airways, Air India and LOT Polish Airlines have reported various problems with the plane.

Earlier this month, Boeing announced that it had found hairline cracks on the wings of some 787 jets under production after a Japanese supplier, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (TYO:7011), warned the airline manufacturer about it. Last July, a fire started aboard a 787 jet owned by Ethiopian Airlines while it was parked at London’s Heathrow Airport. In August, All Nippon Airways, or ANA, found faults in the battery wiring of locator transmitters on two of its Dreamliner airplanes, during checks. In another instance, a section of the fuselage of an Air India-owned Dreamliner was found missing on landing.

"The review team identified some problems with the manufacturing process and the way we oversee it, and we are moving quickly to address those problems," Michael P. Huerta, an FAA administrator, reportedly said in a statement, according to The Wall Street Journal.

“Boeing has mitigated issues related to aircraft assembly and manufacturing using proprietary processes and its QMS. Overall, the subteam noted continued improvement in all areas, as evidenced by the reduced number of interventions, negligible changes to the current processes, and higher quality of output coupled with an increased B787 production rate,” the FAA report said.###5634||Empty###5635||Symantec Corp.

Business News###5636||Empty###5637||Most of the major currency pairs are trading higher this morning or making their way into positive territory. Foreign exchange investors have nerves of steel today, bidding up euro on the official announcement of sanctions on Russian politicians by the U.S. and EU. The U.S. announced plans to freeze the assets of 11 key Russian and Ukrainian officials and the EU will impose sanctions on 21 members of the Ukrainian and Russian government involved in Moscow’s incursion into Crimea. The euro is responding well to these initial measures because they are limited to a small group but today’s announcements represent the international community’s very first response to Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. If Russian troops move into Ukraine, more severe and widespread sanctions are sure to follow. There is very little chance that Russia will bat an eye at these sections. In fact, Putin has threatened his own restrictions, which could be announced in the coming hours or days. So while risk appetite has improved today, under these circumstances, it will be very difficult for the optimism to be sustained because there is a high risk of the crisis in the Ukraine deepening. However, until Russia retaliates investors are buying euros on the relief that the initial sanctions are mild and the currency could aim for fresh 2-year highs.

The aftermath of the referendum in Crimea this weekend is not the only big story in the foreign exchange market. On Saturday, China also doubled its Chinese Yuan trading band. They will now allow the CNY to fluctuate 2% above or below its daily midpoint rate, up from 1%. Given the currency’s recent rapid decent, this decision was not a complete surprise and had only a limited impact on major currencies. Nonetheless it represents a major shift in FX policy for the central bank. The PBoC is clearly using the exchange rate as a means to increase stimulus and provide additional support to its economy as growth slows. With exports falling by the largest amount in more than 4 years during the month of February, the economy could certainly use the support of a weaker currency, which helps to make the cost of Chinese imports more competitive. Although the central bank argues that today’s move is a step towards increasing exchange rate flexibility and greater two-way volatility in the currency, in the context of falling exports the recent slide in the Yuan clearly reflects an attempt to support the economy. A weaker Yuan hurts countries like Australia and Japan who rely heavily on Chinese demand. However even though trade balances could suffer, the AUD and JPY have taken the band winding in stride. For the U.S., China’s announcement impacts the dollar by slowing reserve accumulation. Yet like AUD and JPY, there has been very little reaction in the U.S. dollar.

This morning’s U.S. economic reports did not have much impact on the greenback. Manufacturing activity in the NY region increased slightly less than expected in the month of March but concerns about the sector was offset by a strong rise in industrial and manufacturing production along with an increase in capacity utilization. The NAHB housing market index rose, reflecting an improvement in builder confidence but the increase fell short expectations. As long as these reports show an improvement in the economy, it poses very little threat to the dollar ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC rate decision.###5638||Empty###5639||A new-look £1 coin will have a familiar look but its hi-tech design will help to confound the counterfeiters who target the economy.

But there is no certainly it will be weighing down pockets north of the border because of the little matter of Scottish independence.

Chancellor George Osborne will today announce that the UK is to get the ultra-secure £1 coin. However, Treasury sources made clear it would come into force in Scotland only if there was a No vote in September's referendum.

The new coin will have the same shape as the old 12-sided three pence piece, known in pre-decimalisation days as the "thrupenny bit".

The current £1 coin has been in circulation for more than 30 years, which is much longer than the normal life cycle of a British coin. But it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters. Of the 1.5billion in circulation, the Royal Mint estimates 3%, representing £45m, are fakes. In some parts of the UK, the number of forgeries is as high as 6%.

The Treasury explained that while law enforcement agencies were successfully cracking down on the counterfeiters, the only sustainable way forward was to introduce a new, highly secure coin, that would reduce costs to business and the taxpayer.

The expectation is the new coin will be introduced in 2017. It is intended that, as with the current £1 coin, its obverse side will have images that represent the different parts of the UK.

But a senior Whitehall source stressed that, because all the main Westminster parties had ruled out a currency union between the UK and Scotland in the event of a Yes vote, then there would be no new Scottish £1 coin if Scots opted for independence. "The new coin would not be legal tender in Scotland and so would never come into circulation there," he explained.

The Royal Mint says the new £1 coin will be the most secure in the world. It will be of bi-metallic construction, consisting of two colours, and will include systems that will incorporate three tiers of banknote-strength security.

"After 30 years' loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," said a senior Treasury source.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it is vital we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."

The source pointed out there would be a consultation with industry, but insisted any changeover costs to business would be kept to a minimum because of new technology. The Payments Council, the Automatic Vending Association, the British Retail Consortium and the British Parking Association all welcomed the announcement.

He said the new design was a "fitting tribute" to Britain's heritage, sharing the same shape as the old three pence coin, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. The old threepenny bit was the first to have the dodecagon shape, which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War as its distinctiveness made it the easiest coin to recognise during the air-raid blackouts.###5640||Security giant Symantec fired its president and CEO Steve Bennett Thursday, sending shares plunging 7% in after-hours trading.

PERTH, Australia -- France provided new satellite data Sunday showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

The new information given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia shows "potential objects" in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.

Sunday's search was frustrating because "there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud," Royal Australian Air Force flight Lt. Russell Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.

Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because "we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody."

Details on the French data were not immediately released. The statement from Malaysia called the information "new satellite images," while a statement from France's Foreign Ministry said "radar echoes taken by a satellite" had located floating debris but made no mention of imagery.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is leading the search in waters off Australia, declined to offer details about the information from France. The authority did not respond to multiple requests by The Associated Press for access to the data.

"Any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans," AMSA said.

But a Malaysian official involved in the search mission said the French data consisted of radar echoes captured Friday and converted into fuzzy images that located objects about 930 kilometres (575 miles) north of the spots where the objects in the images released by Australia and China were located.

One of the objects located was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 metres (72 feet) by 13 metres (43 feet), said the official, who declined to be identified because he isn't authorized to speak to the media. It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

Information about the new data emerged as authorities co-ordinating the search, which is being conducted about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, sent planes and a ship to try to "re-find" a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours. It was spotted Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.

"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue co-ordinationcentre. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.

AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.

"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."

Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of Sunday night.

Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether Flight 370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared, but did not immediately respond to the email.

An official with Malaysia Airlines said Sunday night that the flight was carrying wooden pallets but provided no further details, including the number of pallets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy preventing the official from being named.

When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, they first found a wooden pallet. The military initially reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but backtracked hours later and said the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Changes to this year’s stress test

Starting in 2009 with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the stress tests are something of a work in progress. Every year the conditions change (and hopefully improve) to give the government a better idea of how the financial system will hold up during the next financial crisis.

This year the Federal Reserve stopped depending on banks’ own balance sheet and risk-weighted asset growth projections, instead using independent estimates that should improve the consistency of the results. The stress tests were also expanded from the original 18 banks that have taken part since 2009 to include an additional 12 institutions with at least $50 billion in total assets.

The revised capital framework that was approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 was partially phased in during this round of stress tests, and eight institutions with the largest trading and custodial operations were also tested under a global trading shock scenario by estimating losses from their largest counterparty defaulting unexpectedly.

Adverse and severe adverse scenarios

The serious adverse scenario is meant to model a severe recession: a sharp rise in unemployment, equity markets down 50%, and housing prices down to 2001 levels lasting nine quarters. Under this scenario the 30 BHCs would have a combined $366 billion in loan losses, and the aggregate tier 1 common capital ratio would drop from an actual 11.5% to an estimated 7.6%. Considering that the actual tier 1 ratio was 5.5% when the first stress test was conducted in 2009, it’s clear how much progress the financial system has made adjusting to the new capital requirements. Most BHCs fall in the range from just under 6%, still an improvement over the 2009 average, to more than 13%, but Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION)’s has just 3.5% tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the severe adverse stress test.

Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION)’s was also the worst performer under the adverse scenario, which models a moderate recession, but the gap was less pronounced. Overall, the average tier 1 capital ratio falls from 11.5% to 9.7% under adverse conditions, giving some confidence that the financial system is better equipped to deal with unexpected shocks than it was before the last crisis.###5647||Empty###5648||He may not take shirtless horseback rides across the steppes, or have a black belt in judo, but on Thursday, President Obama sent a message to Russian president Vladimir Putin about strength. Specifically, economic strength.

The message was this: Whenever I decide to, I can pick up a pen, and kill a significant financial institution in your country.

Obama’s victim was the St. Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya.

In response to Russia’s takeover of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, Obama yesterday authorized the Treasury Department to add 20 members of Putin’s inner circle, as well as Bank Rossiya, to the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s list of “specially designated nationals.”

The designation makes the individuals named ineligible to do business with U.S. financial institutions, which is likely a major personal inconvenience. But for Bank Rossiya, the designation is something like the kiss of death.



Bank Rossiya is not the largest bank in Russia by a long shot, but its significance lies in its clientele rather than its size. In announcing the sanctions, the Treasury Department noted that Bank Rossiya “is the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation” including members of the Ozero Dacha Cooperative, an exclusive community where members of Putin’s inner circle live. In addition, it provides financial services to the single largest segment of the Russian economy – the oil, gas, and energy sector.

Essentially, this is a credit union for oligarchs, with a side business in financing the Russian energy industry. Its customers include many more high-profile Russians than just those named in the Treasury statement. As of Thursday it is, for all intents and purposes, out of business.

If account holders want to do any kind of business at all short of paying their utility bills and using Russian ATMs, they are going to need to go elsewhere, said experts.

“They’ve got to go to another bank,” said Lester M. Joseph, former principal deputy chief of the Department of Justice’s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering section. “That bank is pretty much a pariah.”

Currently the international investigations manager at Wells Fargo Bank, Joseph said when heard about the sanctions on Bank Rossiya, the first thing he did was check to see if it was a customer of his institution. “It is not, thankfully,” he said.

The impact doesn’t stop there, Joseph explained. His next step, which is ongoing, is to see if any banks that Wells Fargo has relationships with are also doing business with Bank Rossiya, and to make sure that none of those banks are routing transactions from the Russian bank through Wells Fargo’s system. “If a transaction from that bank is coming from another bank, we would have to block it,” he said.

Joseph said that every other bank in the U.S. is – or ought to be – doing exactly the same thing.

Considering the volume of international wire transfers that flow through the systems of U.S. banks, he said, this essentially shuts down Bank Rossiya’s access to a huge portion of the worldwide banking system.

As one U.S. official told Reuters, Bank Rossiya will be “frozen out of the dollar.”

And it only gets worse.

Even if governments in other countries don’t join the U.S. in sanctions against Bank Rossiya, their bankers will have a very strong incentive to stop doing business with the Russian bank if they have any ties at all to U.S. institutions – which virtually all significant international banks do.

“If they are doing business with that bank, and they are also doing business in the United States, if something slips through,” then suddenly they’re facing U.S. regulatory action, said Robert Rowe, vice president and senior counsel for the American Bankers Association. International wire traffic is voluminous and largely automated, he said, making it easier for an international bank to simply stop doing business with Bank Rossiya rather than trying to route transactions associated with it away from the U.S.

Rowe said this would affect not only individuals who do their banking at Bank Rossiya, but perhaps more importantly, the oil and gas companies that arrange their trade financing through the bank.

“That’s where it’s going to have an impact,” said Rowe.

Banking experts said that one of the uncertainties surrounding yesterday’s move is how Russia will respond. The Russian government immediately released a widely mocked list of U.S. officials whom it said would be blocked from doing business in Russia.

Politicians named on the list rushed to Twitter to boast about being sanctioned and to leave sarcastic comments about being forced to forgo vacations in Siberia.

However, according to John Byrne, executive vice president of the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists – a trade group for bankers and law enforcement professionals who deal with issues including OFAC compliance – that’s likely not the end of it.

“There’s no question these sanctions are an appropriate and effective national security tool,

he said, “but this is a country that can fight back.”

How Russia reacts to the sanctions, Byrne said, will be closely watched by the financial community. And that reaction is by no means predictable. In general, major industrialized countries don’t try to shut down each other’s financial institutions without evidence of blatant illegal activity – which does not appear to exist in the case of Bank Rossiya.

“This is a new thing,” said Joseph. “It’s not a rogue bank. It’s a bank in a country where we do a lot of business. It’s not involved in a criminal case.” Compared to other actions by past administrations, he said, “It’s much more complex.”

Top Reads from The Fiscal Times###5649||The tit-for-tat sanctions and travel barring for named individuals between the US and Russia have predictably prompted a sell-off in Russian stocks as nervous investors flee ahead of further restrictions on sectors of the Russian economy.

So far, Bank Rossiya is the only company to be named in the US sanctions list, described by Washington as 'the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation'.

Visa and MasterCard have suspended payment processing services to its clients while Russia's central bank has countered that, if needs be, it will take appropriate measures to protect the interests of Bank Rossiya's depositors and creditors.

Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, part owned by Gennady Timchenko, one of Russia's leading businesmen, today fell by 8 per cent. Gunvor, the fourth-largest oil trader co-founded by Timchenko, is also at the centre of a debate about whether Putin, who is an investor, could commandeer its funds.

The sanctions prompted companies with links to Russia and Ukraine to take hasty action to protect themselves from sanctions particularly regarding their contractual entitlement to suspend their contracts.

Yet despite these dramatic troubles, big investment banks are playing down the impact of a new cold war on the medium-term economy. Hakan Enoksson, head of fixed interest at RBC Wealth Management, told Interactive Investor that the wealth manager's essential view on the economic outlook for European countries had not changed, although the firm has sold out of major Russian corporates such as state-owned energy company Gazprom, which is still at the centre of intense negotiations about the $2 billion (£1.2 billion) owed to it by Kiev.

Barclays also issued a report today which identified a hard landing in China as the biggest risk to derail the global recovery, and largely limits its concern about Russia's oil output, coming at a time when key producers in the Middle East and Africa face serious political and security challenges that are imperilling output.

Fears not unfounded

On China, it said: 'Such fears are not entirely unfounded in the medium term, as it will be very difficult for authorities to restructure the economy toward a more sustainable growth model and enact needed market reforms while at the same time maintaining strong growth and avoiding accidents such as the bursting of a property bubble.

'But so far Chinese policymakers have demonstrated a willingness to put aside their medium-term restructuring goals and employ policy tools such as easier credit and infrastructure spending to avoid any sharp slowdown from becoming sustained.

'Indeed, these measures are already being employed, suggesting to us that the next move in Chinese growth is up.'

On Russia, Barclays notes that while there has been no cut-off of Russian energy supplies through the Ukraine pipeline network to date, such a course of action cannot be ruled out if the crisis escalates, and that the crisis will also jeopardize much-needed long-term Western investment in the Russian energy sector. It will also impact the scope of the nuclear capabilities that Iran will be allowed to retain permanently.

Equity and fixed-income balance

Otherwise, the research highlights the benign 'environment of low inflation, modest growth and very supportive monetary policy [which] is likely to persist over the next several months', adding that with few credible alternatives in fixed income, 'it would be tempting for investors to overload their portfolios with stocks'.

Instead the bank recommends a balance between equities and fixed income on the basis that bonds will be an effective hedge to stockmarket correction.

'We have not seen a bona fide correction for nearly two years and investors have become optimistic, lowering the bar for disappointment,' it said.

'More broadly, stockmarkets have been going up in developed markets even as medium-term growth prospects have been falling due to structural factors such as slower growth in working age populations and higher dependency ratios.

'Unusually supportive monetary policy seems to be boosting financial asset prices more than economic growth, providing a reason to maintain strong positions in stocks in the near term, but hardly comforting in the medium term.'

Sarasin & Partners amongst others have suggested that a bigger risk to the global economy is the Japanese/Chinese row and posturing over five small islands in the Pacific Ocean, known as the Senkaku Islands by the Japanese and the Diaoyu Islands by the Chinese.

Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle Corporation's previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals.

On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors' targets.

Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion.

She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts' consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said.

"They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story," said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. "Investors need to see more. It continues to be a 'prove me' stock in the eyes of investors."

The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit.

SOFTWARE BUSINESS STILL WEAK

Revenue from Oracle Corporation's hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company's $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company's core software business, said Ives.

Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

In response, four-decade-old Oracle Corporation has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc.

"They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example," said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. "They're playing catch up, but they're working quickly and they're starting to make some progress."

On Tuesday's call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.

On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle Corporation is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company's salesforce last year.

"We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now," Hurd said. "We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer."

Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.

Most of Oracle's business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.

Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.

For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.

Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.

Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

It’s 12 days since the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A 250-ton Boeing 777-200 has, for the time being, vanished. Twenty-six countries have joined a search of 2.24m square nautical miles from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite images have given investigators cause to believe there may be debris in the southern Indian Ocean, but so far, a search of the area has found nothing.

In the absence of confirmed sightings, speculation has been rife about what happened to the plane and the 239 people on board, with competing theories feverishly discussed by professionals and amateurs. Some sound more plausible than others. Here, we assess the relative merits of the more prominent explanations for the plane’s disappearance.

1. What happened?

It was an accident …

Those remaining hopeful that no one deliberately wronged MH370 and its passengers were boosted by a much-shared online post by Christopher Goodfellow, a former pilot. Something malfunctioned, Goodfellow surmised, and a sharp turn to the left made in the flight’s first hour was, in fact, a swift attempted re-route by the pilot to the nearest runway on which he could land: a 13,000-foot strip on Pulau Langkawi, the largest island in an archipelago of 104 in the Andaman Sea.

The left turn is the key here. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a very experienced senior captain with 18,000 hours of flight time. We old pilots were drilled to know what is the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Airports behind us, airports abeam us, and airports ahead of us. They’re always in our head. Always. If something happens, you don’t want to be thinking about what are you going to do – you already know what you are going to do. When I saw that left turn with a direct heading, I instinctively knew he was heading for an airport. He was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi, a 13,000-foot airstrip with an approach over water and no obstacles.

Goodfellow theorised that “there was most likely a fire or electrical fire” He suggested that the plane’s transponder and ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) were shut off as casualties of a scramble to tackle this blaze. “In the case of fire the first response is to pull all the main [electrical] busses and restore circuits one by one until you have isolated the bad one,” he said, adding that the crew could have been incapacitated by smoke before they could land, leaving the plane to fly on for six or more hours on autopilot, before eventually crashing.

Goodfellow’s theory was comfortingly simple, but suffered from a major shortcoming. Malaysian authorities have said the plane appeared to have been re-routed a second time after that first sharp turn. A third tracking device, on the plane’s engines, continued sending intermittent electronic “pings” via satellite to the ground for another six hours, indicating that the plane continued to fly.

The final “ping” put its last known position on one of two arcs. Investigators said that the electronic “pings” put its last known position on one of two arcs of a circle emanating out from the satellite that detected it. One arc is to the north, over China, and the other is to the south over the Indian ocean, off the western coast of Australia. Goodfellow’s assumed autopilot could not have taken the plane to either destination.

“If the pings are accurate, the plane turned again,” said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and an author on aviation. “Autopilot only does what it tells you to.” He went on: “It is also very unlikely that the plane could have carried on flying for hours after it had indeed suffered a fire or other mechanical catastrophe”. Smith concluded: “It is not a strong theory.”

It was no accident …

After it was discovered that the two separate communications systems were turned off, investigators said that they had concluded that MH370 was the victim of a hijacking or sabotage. “These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,” Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said. Little other solid evidence has been produced or cited by the Malaysians for why this conclusion was reached. Still, two theories followed.

a) The pilot or co-pilot were responsible

Attention has focused on captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. A transponder and ACARS can only be shut down by someone who knows what he or she is doing. “The flight crew, by virtue of the controls and the circuit-breaker panels in the cockpit, have the ability to remove power from them,” said Dennis Schmitz, a veteran engineer and executive in the aviation communications industry. Malaysian ministers also initially said, at a 15 March news conference, that one of the communicating systems was switched off before the last known verbal message from the cockpit – “all right, good night”.

But authorities later backtracked on this, admitting they did not know exactly when the systems were shut down. The pilots did not show signs of radical activity, although Shah’s support for a Malaysian opposition leader jailed the day before the flight has been much analysed. The pair also did not request to fly together, and appear to have been upstanding professionals, according to several profiles. Adding to the confusion, US officials briefed reporters in recent days that the plane was first manually rerouted before that final verbal sign-off – again indicating foul play in the cockpit from someone with technical knowhow. “That is a red flag,” said Smith.



Shah kept a flight simulator at home. Malaysian officials said on Wednesday that some files had been removed from it several weeks ago. “The experts are looking at what are the logs, what has been cleared,” Malaysian police inspector general Tan Sri Khalid Bin Abu Bakar told reporters, at a news conference. Hishammuddin Hussein, the defence and acting transport minister, appeared to confirm reports that the FBI had been asked to help analyse the files, which he said were being looked at with “local and international expertise”.

b) The plane was hijacked by someone else

If the plane was deliberately sabotaged, and the pilots were not responsible, someone else on the plane must have been. Malaysian military radar “appeared to show that the missing airliner climbed to 45,000 feet” before descending steeply, the New York Times reported, which could potentially indicate a struggle in the cockpit. However, this report also prompted speculation that a knowledgeable flyer had deliberately flown that high in an attempt to deprive some on board of oxygen, thus knocking them out or even killing them.

There remains a lack of consensus among experts about the precise technicalities of ACARS. A full disabling of the system requires circuits to be broken not only in the cockpit “but also in the electronics bay”, according to Smith. This bay is found beneath the flight deck, indicating that someone involved was at one point outside the cockpit.

The passengers included two men flying on stolen passports and at least one from China’s restive Xinjiang region, whose separatist militants were blamed for a knife attack at a railway station that killed 29 people earlier this month.

Yet the men travelling on stolen passports appear to have been seeking asylum in Europe and had no clear connection to terrorism or militant groups. Background checks on passengers and crew have turned up no likely suspects, and China has announced that it has unearthed nothing untoward in the profiles of the two-thirds of passengers who were Chinese. Commandeering the plane, disabling its communications systems and flying it smoothly would require organisation and expertise that would seem difficult to hide.

However, no message claiming responsibility for taking the plane appears to have been left by any passenger, and no group has claimed responsibility for it. And – to state the obvious – nothing appears to have been done with it.

2. Where is the plane?

The northern of the two arcs identified by investigators as the possible locations from where the plane sent its final “ping” sweeps from southern to north-western China, prompting speculation that MH370 might have flown over south Asia towards smaller central territories, where it could have landed. Some have even suggested it could have been parked, awaiting use in a future terrorist attack. But “there are hundreds of planes in airports and depots all over the world,” Smith pointed out. “Why take this one and force the whole world to look for you?”

Kazakhstan and Krgyzstan were quickly singled out as potential landing spots. Yet both governments stressed that they would have detected the plane, and did not. “Even if all on-board equipment is switched off, it is impossible to fly through in a silent mode,” Serik Mukhtybayev, deputy head of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Committee, said in a statement. “There are also military bodies monitoring the country’s air space.” Dair Tokobayev, vice-president of Kyrgyzstan’s main civilian airport, told Reuters: “This plane did not fly over Kyrgyzstan’s territory.”

And for the plane to have reached that arc several hours after losing contact with the ground, it would have probably have needed to avoid detection by several major militaries in the region. While most countries protect the locations of their radar sites, researchers estimate that China alone has about 30 long-range systems.

“They must have long-range radar out there,” said Ron Ruggeri, a veteran air-traffic controller and instructor at Vaughn College of aeronautics and technology. “If the plane did go that way, somebody would have seen it.” He went on: “Things are also a little on-edge in that part of the world. If they did not know who this plane was, I’d expect them to scramble jets to find out”.

b) The plane flew somewhere else

Dismissing the significance of the two possible arcs, some have speculated that sightings show the MH370 went on to fly elsewhere. Residents of some remote islands in the Maldives said they had spotted a “low-flying jumbo jet” on the morning the MH370 disappeared, according to Haveeru, a local news site. Their description seemed to match that of the missing jet.

However the Maldives government swiftly dismissed the suggestion. “Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country,” said the Maldives National Defence Force in a statement, adding that airport radar had come up short, too.

Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox, suggested on Twitter that the plane might have been “effectively hidden, perhaps in northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden”. The Pakistani government has firmly rejected the notion and said the plane was not detected by its radars. Indian officials have also pushed back against speculation the plane flew over the country.

c) The plane flew to the south and probably crashed into the sea

Proponents of the second arc, which curves away gradually from the western coast of Australia, have MH370 heading south from its sharp left turn, over the Indian ocean. The lack of confirmed sightings by radar systems to the north, and the fact that no wreckage of the plane has been recovered in Asia, has boosted speculation that this is the more likely of the two directions. On Thursday, the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, told parliament in Canberra that satellite imagery had found two possible pieces of debris at a location 2,500km (1,500 miles) south-west of Perth. Detailed analysis of that imagery produced “new and credible information”, he said, although an initial aerial search turned up nothing.

Map shows where the Australian Maritime Safety Authority plans to search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on 18 March 2014.

After hitting the southern arc and flying on for a little longer, the plane could have descended into the two-mile-deep ocean and sunk, along with its two “black box” data recorders that will have collected information and audio from the cockpit. More than a third of the recorders’ 30-day batteries, which allow it to send a beacon-like signal to investigators, have now expired.



Experts stress that the south is likely to prove more fruitful. “I look for who would have the best intelligence,” said Dr Todd Curtis, a former airline safety analyst for Boeing. “The US has a view of what’s going on all over the world, and when the White House announced last week that it was despatching the seventh fleet to the Indian Ocean, it signalled to me that this was the most likely location. And since then, the Australians have taken the lead down there.”

Australia said on Thursday that it had halved the search area in the Indian Ocean – albeit to an area still covering 300,000 square kilometres – and moved it closer to Perth.

Reuters quoted a source close to the investigation on Wednesday as saying: “The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor.” Within hours, however, this had been challenged by the Malaysian defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein. “They are both equally important,” he said of the two arcs. “But the southern corridor is much more challenging.”###5653||Empty###5654||Empty###5655||Empty###5656||Empty###5657||Empty###5658||Empty###5659||Indiana's Unemployment Rate Drops To 6.4 Percent

Shares of enterprise and consumer software vendor Symantec (SYMC) are down $2.64, or almost 13%, at $18.26, after the company yesterday afternoon abruptly announced it terminated CEO Steve Bennett, saying it needed new management to "driver on the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth.

The stock has gotten gotten five downgrades this morning, that I can see, from Jefferies & Co., R.W. Baird, UBS, MKM Partners, and Cowen & Co.

The bears, including those downgrading today, see disruption despite much progress made by Bennett to date. Some bulls, however, defended the shares, pointing out the low valuation.

Brent Thill, UBS: Cuts his rating to Neutral from Buy, and cuts his price target to $21 from $27. "Our Buy-rating was predicated on the turnaround abilities of prior CEO Steve Bennett, view there was 1,000bp of OM expansion over the next few years, and belief that it could innovate in product. We believe the Board was happy w/ Steve Bennett's operational performance but less so with the product strategy which increases the risk profile of revs and leverage going forward. Don't see much downside at 11x CY14e EPS, 3% div yield, but no catalysts and absent a permanent CEO and new CFO arriving product strategy, revs growth and margins too opaque [...] Key risk is that the new product portfolio and strategy expected to be unveiled at the Vision user conference in May is not ready or worse underwhelming which raises earnings risk. If the Board felt a new CEO was needed to address the product direction and/or quicken the pace of the existing strategy, both scenarios suggest a prolonged turn in bookings which we see as required to resume stock momentum."

Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen & Co.: Cuts his rating to Market Perform from Outperform, and cuts his price target to $20 from $25. "Mr. Bennett's hiring had precipitated a wave of investor optimism that the former Intuit CEO could transform SYMC into a co. capable of material operating improvement. His strategy was, in our view, necessarily far-reaching, and some disruption had always been inevitable. Nonetheless, the impact to bookings over the last two quarters had been more painful than most, including us, had expected. We also suspect part of the reason for the change in leadership is that Bennett is short on technical expertise (and we note the co.'s integrated product strategy has taken longer to deliver than expected), although we don't believe that tells the entire story. While SYMC hasn't changed its long-term targets, the co. indicated that it will accelerate its focus on product innovation and growth. That may cause some investors to believe the co. will taper its cost-cutting. For our part, we continue to believe 30%+ op. margins by FY17 is very achievable; however, given the changing of the guard, our prior view that SYMC could be a mid 30s op. margin company in 3-4 years no longer holds. We also continue to be very skeptical of SYMC's 5%+ growth target, regardless of how much increased emphasis SYMC may opt to place on this going forward."

Walter Pritchard, Citigroup: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $28 price target. "It is clear the move was precipitated by the board and was made because the board didn't believe the company was moving fast enough towards goals outlined. Bennett had only been CEO for six quarters and had made significant change in the process. It is not clear in our view what could have moved faster. Perhaps waiting three quarters to make significant changes to the sales organization was the issue, although its unlikely this would have been decided without input from the board. September appeared to be the bottom (~17% billings decline), with billings declining 10% in December. We forecast "less bad" March (-5%) and then flattening of billings in FY15 and a return to modest growth. Our inputs up until this point continue to lead us to believe this is likely. The company did reiterate March quarter guidance, although with timing of quarter close in 10 days, it is not clear anyone can have great confidence in this reiteration. This is all in the stock at 8x cash flow, in our view – Shares are cheap and investor sentiment is worst in our space. Its been rare that software stocks trade below 8x cash flow, suggesting the market believes numbers are still too aggressive. While fundamentals may have taken a turn for the worst, we note that our FCF (unleveled) estimate for FY14 ($1.28B) is below average of last year's ($1.48B) and looks reasonable to us."

Raimo Lenschow, Barclays: Reiterates an Overweight rating, and a $26 price target. "Though it was clear that operational improvements were necessary at the company, it was likely too much and too quick for the BoD which ultimately led to today's event. While Symantec is committing to the previously set guidance, in addition to the "5/30" long-term goal set by Steve Bennett, it is nevertheless a short-term blow to the investment case. However, we feel longer term Symantec's positioning in the industry and the current valuation (c. 10x CY15 PE), which is one of the cheapest in our sector still supports the potential for share price improvement and ongoing earnings and cash flow growth […] Given that Mr. Brown expressed his wishes not to be considered for the permanent role, the candidate will likely be external though we would expect much of the operational actions introduced by Mr. Bennett to remain intact as in our view they were generally the right steps to take but were executed upon much too aggressively, like realigning 90% of the company's sales force in a single quarter and creating a sizable billings and deferred revenue hole for a mostly recurring revenue business model […] Given recent management hires, particularly the appointment of Amit Mital as Chief Technology Officer, who joined the company after a 20-year career at Microsoft, we believe that from a product perspective the company is still generally well positioned in the industry. We would also note that interim CEO Mike Brown does have public company CEO experience, joining Symantec through the acquisition of VERITAS Software in July 2005, and had also previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation which is likely to provide some level of business continuity throughout this transition."###5661||* Yen continues to lose safe-haven glow

* Focus on Putin speech later in session

* U.S. CPI, housing-related data awaited

By Shinichi Saoshiro

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen stayed below a recent peak against the dollar and the euro stood firm on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar held steady at 101.76 yen, staying above a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday. The dollar gained some support against the yen after U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday as safety demand for government debt receded.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.3934, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit on Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

Against the yen, the euro edged up 0.1 percent to about 141.79 yen.

After Sunday’s referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and the European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

“In immediate focus is Russian president Putin’s speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

“But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving U.S. government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar,” he said.

PUTIN SPEECH

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia’s State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow’s involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia’s armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

One possible resistance level for the dollar against the yen now lies around 102.30 yen, said Philip Wee, senior currency economist for DBS Bank in Singapore.

The dollar’s 20-day moving average now lies roughly around 102.30 yen, while the 100-day moving average comes in slightly above that level, around 102.38 yen.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8729. The dollar had hit a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8698 against the Swiss franc last week on trading platform EBS, but has since pulled up from that trough as investor risk aversion ebbed.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, was at 79.355, clinging above a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the U.S. consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar’s likely direction.###5662||Employers in Colorado added 7,300 nonfarm payroll jobs from December to January for a total of 2,412,200 jobs, according to the survey of business establishments. Private sector payroll jobs increased 7,600 and government decreased 300.

According to the survey of households, the unemployment rate decreased one-tenth of 1 percentage point to 6.1 percent. The number of people actively participating in the labor force increased 5,900 to 2,754,600 and total employment increased 8,000 to 2,586,100, causing the number of unemployed to decline 2,000.

The national unemployment rate decreased one-tenth of 1 percentage point over the same period to 6.6 percent.

Over the year, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased from 34.3 to 34.2 hours and average hourly earnings increased from $25.11 to $26.11.

The largest over-the-month private sector job gains were in leisure and hospitality, construction and education and health services. Other services declined by 1,100 jobs.

Over the year, nonfarm payroll jobs increased 63,200 with an increase of 59,400 in the private sector and an increase of 3,800 in government. The largest private sector job gains were in professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and education and health services. There were no significant over-the-year losses.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down one and one-tenth of 1 percent from 7.2 percent in January 2013. The number of Coloradans participating in the labor force decreased 2,000, total employment increased 28,300 and the number of unemployed decreased 30,300. The national unemployment rate declined from 7.9 to 6.6 percent from January 2013 to January this year.

In 2013 the Colorado labor force peaked at 2,758,400 in April, which is also a series peak, and declined steadily through December to 2,749,600, down 8,800. The labor force increased in January by 5,900 returning to within 2,900 of the 2013 peak.

Total employment, which reached a series peak of 2,611,300 in March 2008, climbed to an annual peak of 2,578,100 in December 2013. Total employment increased 8,000 from December to January to 2,586,100, which is 25,200 below the series peak.

The number of unemployed Coloradans reached a series peak of 246,700 in October 2010. The number of unemployed has declined steadily over 2013 to reach 170,600 in December 2013. In January the number of unemployed declined further by 2,000 to 168,500. (The numbers do not add due to rounding.) The last time the number of unemployed was at this level or lower was December 2008 when there were an estimated 167,500 unemployed.

The Colorado unemployment rate peaked at 9.1 percent in October 2010 and has declined almost without interruption since. The last time the unemployment rate was as low as 6.1 percent was December 2008. The 2013 annual average Colorado unemployment rate remains unchanged by the annual revision process and is 6.8 percent.

Colorado labor force participation reached a series peak of 74.4 percent in July 1998. Though labor force participation has alternately declined and increased as work attitudes have been affected by the business cycle, labor force participation is expected to continue to decline with the rate of decline accelerating as baby boomers continue to age out of the workforce.

Revised figures show Colorado lost 151,400 payroll jobs from a peak of 2,362,700 reached May 2008 to a trough of 2,211,300 reached January 2010. Revisions also indicate full recovery occurred in April 2013 when Colorado total nonfarm payroll jobs exceeded the May 2008 peak and reached a level of 2,367,300. Another milestone occurred when Colorado payroll jobs exceeded 2.4 million in October 2013 reaching 2,400,900, up from 2,397,100 in September 2013.

The annual growth rate of Colorado nonfarm payroll jobs was 3.0 percent in 2013 revised up from 2.4 percent. The U.S. annual payroll jobs growth rate in 2013 was 1.7 percent.###5663||By Eva Taylor and Kirsti Knolle

MANNHEIM, Germany, March 18 (Reuters) - German analyst and investor sentiment plunged in March at the fastest pace in nearly a year amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could weigh on Europe’s largest economy, a leading survey showed on Tuesday.

Mannheim-based think tank ZEW’s monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts. The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

It was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

“The Crimea Crisis is weighing on expert’s economic expectations for Germany,” said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. “Nevertheless, the indicator’s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.”

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The United States and European Union imposed personal sanctions on Monday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.

The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0 yet still underscoring the strength of the German economy.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said the combination of emerging market turbulences earlier this year and the stand-off between Russia and the West may have a “mildly dampening impact on Germany’s investment climate” and therefore on growth.

But he noted that “it would take a much more serious crisis in Ukraine to derail the recovery in Germany and the euro zone as a whole”.

The German economy, a growth locomotive in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8 percent this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.

Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January. Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.

The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said.###5664||If you change your mind, here's how to allow notifications:

Walmart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products – from canned beans to dishwashing soap – with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form of a store credit.

Additional Photos Walmart has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store →

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called Savings Catcher, on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could not only change the way people shop, but also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Citibank launched a similar program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if Citibank finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Walmart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it’s successful, others may follow.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

After sending queries to some of Walmart’s competitors, it wasn’t clear Friday afternoon whether they planned to follow the move. And Walmart did not immediately answer questions about why it does not compare online prices.

Walmart’s U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health.

For the new tool, a customer has to set up an account on www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately.

Oracle, after all, reports its third quarter after the market closes on Tuesday, and you would be well advised to preemptively arch your brow at the media coverage that stands to follow.

On the most fundamental level, Wall Street is expecting Oracle ORCL, +0.90% to earn 67 cents on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to Zacks, up from 63 cents on sales of $8.96 billion.

Not too shabby, but not too great either. The four-decade-old hardware, software and server peddler is, at least now, on the wrong side of industry history, competing against a wide range of nimble cloud-computing outfits from Salesforce.com CRM, -1.39% to Workday WDAY, -1.85% all of whom are playing for keeps. Oracle’s prospects for organic growth in this all-important and still-unformed sector is at best (and apologies ahead of time for the groaner) cloudy.

That’s why a problem may arise if Oracle manages to beat earnings by a penny or two in their third quarter, as they might. Look at what happened in response to Oracle’s second quarter. Even after pulling up short over the three previous quarters, Oracle touched their toe past expectations, and the media declared the company’s groove all but back. Trumpeted Forbes, “Smoother Sailing For Oracle.”

Stay cautious for more of the same today, which might cause the stock to get ahead of itself. Pronouncing a lumbering, rusty company back and better than ever after what amounts to little more than a technical beat can be a dangerous game.

That is because in the real world, of course, pennies do little more than weigh down coat jackets or line the bottom of sock drawers. But for the media, a penny takes on outsized importance.

Sarah Lawrence College Marek Fuchs

Never mind that a company beating expectations often symbolizes little more than the fact that management did a commendable job of gaming expectations, guiding low so they can come in high. For a company — like Oracle, The New York Times NYT, +0.42% or even Apple AAPL, +1.74% for that matter — trying to adjust to the stark new realities of their respective marketplaces, a penny often symbolizes nothing more than a strategic pairing down of the workforce or cutback in research or a more favorable tax rate or currency rate or one in a million other factors more cosmetic than substantive.

Granted: Oracle is a great company, even if it’s CEO is skipping out on the occasional earnings conference call these days to watch his America’s Cup boat sail. Moreover, their cloud business sales were up 35% in the second quarter, which is, to a degree, substantive. In true form, though, the media got all jiggy with this — as they might today. The Wall Street Journal even celebrated with an uncharacteristically p-unny headline: “Oracle: We’re Cloudier Than You Think”

The operative point is that Oracle’s cloud business is presumably up over a very small base and the company doesn’t even break out cloud revenues, which means at this point, who even knows? Pegging too much on such an ill-defined measure of progress is, well, clouded thought.

But beware another bad roll of clouds. Rather than holding a bias to the left or right, the business media tend to hold a bias toward a new story line. They love to declare a permanent shift in fortunes because that instantly transforms a standard just-the-facts-ma’am earnings story into a piece of greater import. That’s why the media go on such frequent goose chases for larger meaning.

Media coverage is not improvisational. It tends to run the same course each time. And we’ve seen this one before. If Oracle reports earnings that edge expectations, don’t believe the hype or triumphant coverage. For a company in a troubled industry, in the early stages of facing up to a host of secular challenges, one — or even two — quarter’s penny beat gives credence to nothing.

What we stand to hear on Oracle is not the truth. It’s just a tale told by the media, signifying nothing.

The country's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers bought its mobile-service business in 2008 from China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. as part of a government-mandated restructuring of the telecommunications sector and has spent heavily on the business.

Analysts have said that China Telecom's profitability is expected to improve from 2013 as its efforts to attract high-spending users begin to pay off.

Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 17.55 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) from 14.95 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 14% to 321.58 billion yuan.

China's telecommunications carriers have focused on improving their networks to meet an increase in data traffic as more consumers replace basic cellphones with smartphones. China has already overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest smartphone market and mobile-data demand is expected to rise.

China Unicom, another major Chinese carrier, reported last month a 47% increase in full-year earnings as smaller players continue to attract customers from market leader China Mobile Ltd.

China Mobile, the world's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, reports full-year earnings on Thursday and is expected to post a profit fall as it boosted network investments and handset subsidies to battle competition.

China Telecom and China Unicom will benefit from lower interconnection fees that they pay to China Mobile from the beginning of this year, as the government seeks to promote competition in the sector. Savings from lower interconnection fees will allow smaller carriers to fund network upgrades and marketing campaigns, allowing them to boost market share, analysts said.

China Mobile is the country's dominant mobile phone network carrier, with more than 770 million mobile subscribers and over 50% of domestic market share. China Telecom is the smallest of the country's three main mobile carriers.

Posted by Greg Palmer###5675||Empty###5676||**UPDATE: Given the enormous interest and response from readers, including many Walmart employees, vendors and other associates, I will continue to update this story on a new Page Five as more emails come in. Of course, if we receive an official Walmart response, I'll include that as well.



"Your reporting about Wal-Mart deserves wide distribution. Shareholders should be in open revolt about this train wreck of an organization." --Reader Email

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- As I have noted in recent days, the response to my recent Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stories has been nothing short of overwhelming.

It all started with 24 Pictures From a Walmart Store That Make Sears Look Classy.

A considerable portion of it comes from readers who work at Walmart. Many of the emails I have received from Walmart employees, independent of one another, corroborate one another. I'll publish a representative sampling in this article.

Of course, I keep identities anonymous if that was what was requested. In other cases, I mention specific stores but do not include details that would out specific individuals.

I have repeatedly asked Walmart for comment and have received no response.

The responses I received from readers indicates a systemic problem at Walmart -- one created by folks at the corporate level, not on the ground, in retail stores. In fact, given the position Walmart appears to have put many of its retail workers in, it's amazing enough of them can keep it together well enough to keep the business running. Without considerable intervention, this can't possibly end well. In fact, I really believe we're watching a failure unfold in front of our eyes. But it's one we're watching spring from the ground up, even though the people on the ground should not be held culpable.

If Walmart doesn't act fast to right the ship, disgruntled employees and dirty stores might become more than a minor irritation. They could further damage the business and, in turn, the company's stock price.

First, consider the following (lightly edited, bold emphasis added) email from a Walmart employee, who will remain completely anonymous:

Regarding your photos of Wal-Mart article, when I read it I just had to laugh. I work at a Wal-Mart and I can tell you with no uncertainty that the single reason for all of the problems in those photos is understaffing. This is not a store by store problem, either; it is a corporate problem. Corporate decides how many hours we are allowed to schedule employees with each week and how many employees we are allowed to hire, and it usually falls short of what we, the employees, feel we need.

For instance, resets used to be done by a 3rd shift team, but they were a small team and could only ever get grocery resets done, so we in the general merchandise area had to do our own during the day. It's irrelevant now, as the reset team has since been eliminated.

I address the excuse that the mess I photo-illustrated at the South LA Walmart exists because of "resets" (wholesale reshaping/restocking of large sections of a store) in Monday's Walmart: Retail's Biggest Embarrassment.

The emailer continues by outlining what happens on the ground as a result of this understaffing:

Every week for the last 5 years, and every DAY for the last 2-3 months, 1st and 2nd shift employees at our store have been responsible for stocking freight from the previous day's trucks because we don't have enough 3rd shift stockers to accomplish this. That means every single day we have pallets on the floor in almost every general merchandise department, with associates -- who are supposed to be focused on other things like helping customers -- stocking shelves. With so much time dedicated to stocking, we have little time left to put away carts of junk or clean up aisles (as seen in your photos). If we try to do our real job duties instead, we get yelled at by management for not dealing with the freight. Most days the backup of freight in the back room is so bad we literally can't move back there, which means if a customer wants something that's back there, they aren't getting it.

The emailer closes with this:

You are right to say executives should be embarrassed of all this.

Another emailer corroborates the original emailer's statement regarding "resets" with the following correspondence:

###5677||Empty###5678||Empty###5679||By Sneha Shankar - A combined review done by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, into the airplane maker's pioneering 787 Dreamliner, has concluded that its design and manufacture are sound.

According to the report released Wednesday, the FAA had ordered a review of the planes last year, after grounding the entire fleet following a series of problems with onboard batteries. The report said that some Boeing suppliers did not follow the right industry standards for quality control but added that “effective processes” had been put in place since then to correct the problem.

“The CSRT (Critical Systems Review Team) determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane’s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification,” the report said.

The report also concluded that the FAA should increase its supervision of foreign and "high-risk" subcontractor facilities and recommended that Boeing should ensure its suppliers "are fully aware of their responsibilities" and formulate a way to ensure that they "identify realistic program risk."

Although Illinois-based Boeing’s 787 is reportedly one of the most advanced planes in the market, it has been hit with a series of problems that have cast doubts on the plane’s airworthiness. Many of the company's customers, including Qatar Airways, Air India and LOT Polish Airlines have reported various problems with the plane.

Earlier this month, Boeing announced that it had found hairline cracks on the wings of some 787 jets under production after a Japanese supplier, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (TYO:7011), warned the airline manufacturer about it. Last July, a fire started aboard a 787 jet owned by Ethiopian Airlines while it was parked at London’s Heathrow Airport. In August, All Nippon Airways, or ANA, found faults in the battery wiring of locator transmitters on two of its Dreamliner airplanes, during checks. In another instance, a section of the fuselage of an Air India-owned Dreamliner was found missing on landing.

"The review team identified some problems with the manufacturing process and the way we oversee it, and we are moving quickly to address those problems," Michael P. Huerta, an FAA administrator, reportedly said in a statement, according to The Wall Street Journal.

“Boeing has mitigated issues related to aircraft assembly and manufacturing using proprietary processes and its QMS. Overall, the subteam noted continued improvement in all areas, as evidenced by the reduced number of interventions, negligible changes to the current processes, and higher quality of output coupled with an increased B787 production rate,” the FAA report said.###5680||The United States and the European Union are imposing targeted economic sanctions -- and threatening even broader measures -- against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. RFE/RL takes a look at some basics of the art of sanctioning.



Who has the authority to impose sanctions?



Russia insists that unilateral sanctions violate international law.



"Unilateral sanctions have never brought about anything good. They are illegitimate and have no international legal basis," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on March 20 to the Russian Duma.



"The [UN] Security Council is the only body that can make decisions about coercive measures toward sovereign states. No such decision has been made by it regarding the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian leadership represented by [ousted Ukrainian] President [Viktor] Yanukovych."



At the same time, Russia has repeatedly imposed trade barriers and restrictions on many countries, particularly ones like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia that have pursued aggressive European-integration policies.



What role does the World Trade Organization (WTO) play?



Russia joined the WTO in 2012, and the United States and all EU member states are also members. The EU itself is also a member of the WTO.



Although the WTO is intended to facilitate international trade, its rules, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), include provisions that enable countries to establish trade restrictions for "national security reasons."



"Under Article 21 of the GATT, there is an exception for national-security reasons. This is generally been interpreted as the provision under which any economic sanctions would fall," says Stephen Woolcock, an associate professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.



Russia could, however, challenge any sanctions through WTO dispute-settlement mechanisms. And, theoretically, the WTO could overturn sanctions that were determined to be in violation of GATT rules.



Such a turn of events is considered highly unlikely as long as sanctions remain at the level of targeted measures against individuals. If the West moves to broader sanctions aimed at the Russian economy, which U.S. President Barack Obama has said could happen, Russia might have more grounds to seek redress.



But Woolcock notes that sanctions have been imposed against WTO members in the past and none has been successfully challenged within the organization.



The WTO has no mechanism for sanctioning members or expelling them. Some countries have left of their own accord, however.



Some analysts have argued that the WTO could also be used to punish Moscow, as members could file complaints against Russia for some of its controversial trade practices. In July, for instance, the EU announced it would challenge a Russian law that imposes a fee on foreign car producers for scrapping used vehicles in Russia.



Do the sanctions extend to the family members of targeted individuals?



Not automatically, says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the London-based Center for European Reform and a veteran British diplomat. "They won't automatically extend to relatives, but they will, for example, extend to shell companies where the EU or the U.S. can identify that the controlling interest is held by a person who is subject to sanctions," he says.



It has been reported, for instance, that Russian oil trader Gennady Timchenko sold his stake in Swiss-based Gunvor to his business partner on the eve of the announcement of sanctions against him. Bond says financial authorities will certainly investigate that alleged sale and could rule that Timchenko continues to benefit from Gunvor's assets.



If EU or U.S. financial authorities can prove that a relative is merely holding assets that benefit a sanctioned individual, those assets could also be targeted.



Expanding the targeted sanctions to family members could be done as an additional measure of targeted sanctions before the West moves to broader sanctions against the Russian economy.



Why hasn't Russian President Vladimir Putin been sanctioned?



Sanctions against a sitting head of state are extremely rare and are generally reserved only for rulers that Western countries would like to see removed, such as Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe or the former ruling military junta in Burma.



Ian Bond says doing so is the "nuclear option" of targeted sanctions. "And I guess that everybody is trying not to go for steps that are really at the top of the list of things that could be done," he adds. "There is still a lot more that could go wrong, a lot more ways in which Russia could interfere in Ukraine and make the situation worse."



What about possible sanctions against Russian state journalists and publicists such as Sergei Markov or Aleksandr Dugin, who have been actively justifying Russia's intervention in Ukraine?



Bond says sanctions could be imposed upon such people if the West determines they are actively promoting violence or disseminating hate speech. It is, however, an issue on which Europe and the United States might not be able to agree.



"I realize that is very difficult territory particularly for the U.S. because of its very strong attachment to the First Amendment" of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech," Bond says. "It is in some ways less of an issue for Europeans because certainly in countries like Germany, for very good historical reasons, they have pretty strong laws on how far you are allowed to go."



The latest round of EU sanctions includes Dmitry Kiselyov, the head of the Russian state news agency Rossia Segodnya. The EU document describes Kiselyov as a "central figure of the government propaganda machine supporting the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine."

Troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox has said it has found 200,000 Bitcoin worth roughly £70m.

Chief executive of the company Mark Karpeles said the Bitcoin were found in an online wallet, which MtGox believed held none of the digital currency.

The exchange said:

MtGox had certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any Bitcoins. On March 7, 2014, Mt.Gox confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC.



In February, MtGox suspended trading and took its website offline, as well as erasing the company's twitter account. MtGox lost approximately 750,000 Bitcoin - close to seven per cent of all Bitcoin in circulation. The exchange had been plagued by the transaction malleability problem.

10 days ago the company received some welcome news as a Texas judge temporarily halted two US lawsuits, while bankruptcy proceedings continue in Japan.

In February, MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said it had an outstanding debt of $63m (£37m).

MtGox will return to court 1 April to attempt to extend the shielding of its asset's until the Japanese case is concluded.###5682||The euro held strong over the weekend even as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated.

The common currency traded at $1.39 at 5:45 GMT on Monday morning after economic data from the bloc supported the European Central Bank's view that the region was headed towards sustainable recovery.

The euro was resilient despite news that Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that asked the world not to recognize the Crimean vote on whether to join Russia and succeed from Ukraine. The veto highlighted the growing tension between Western leaders and Moscow as the crisis in Ukraine raged on.

On Sunday, more than 95 percent of Crimean citizens voted to join Russia in a vote that many Western leaders consider to be a violation of Ukraine's treaty as well as international law. In response, the US and Europe have said they will respond to the vote by enacting economic sanctions on Russia as early as Monday. Meanwhile, in other parts of Ukraine, pro-Russian rallies have flared up creating worries that Moscow could intervene further.

However, the euro remained supported despite the turmoil after data last week showed that the region's unemployment rate finally decreased. According to the Wall Street Journal , the EU's statistics agency reported that the number of people with jobs from October to December rose 0.1 percent to 145 million. That figure marks the first rise in eurozone employment since 2011 and added to the common currency's growing strength.

ECB President Mario Draghi expressed his concern about the rising euro last week, saying that the currency's strength could intervene in the bloc's efforts to increase inflation. Consumer prices in the region rose by just 0.8 percent in February, far below the bank's two percent target and dangerously close to deflation. Many are expecting the bank to step in and fight the region's falling inflation using monetary policy at its April meeting.

Antivirus and security software heavyweight Symantec certainly caught the market off-guard yesterday (20th March). The company’s shares are feeling the heat today – down around 13% at time of writing.

The US-based company announced the termination of Steve Bennett as President and CEO.

At the same time, Symantec reiterated its fourth quarter revenue and profit guidance: it expects revenue of between $1.62bn and $1.66bn (versus $1.75bn the previous year).

Still, the move to fire Mr Bennett has created something of a stir given that he was just 20 months into the job of trying to restore the company to growth.

Competition is fierce

Prevalent cyber-attacks and security breaches and the resulting sustained emphasis on the need for security means that the market is seen as growing.

So it’s no surprise that competition is fierce among both existing players and relatively new entrants as they grapple to gain a larger share of the growing security market. Following underperformance, and in a bid to reposition competitively, Symantec embarked on a transformation plan, which included developing new competitive products and cutting costs.

But, over the last few quarters, declining sales and a plummeting share price (down some 32% from highs reached last summer) have plagued the company.

In light of Symantec’s recent performance, it’s perhaps fair to say that, despite turnaround efforts, the journey towards renewed growth seemed a tad protracted under Mr Bennett’s helm.

That said, given that the Norton antivirus maker sports a net cash position of around $1.8bn (as at December last year), it does have some financial flexibility to embark on further investments as it continues pursuing a turn around.

But shareholders’ patience might be running out…

According to the company’s interim CEO, Michael Brown, “the need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market”.

Indeed, that’s true but it was also just as true some two years ago.

The sell-off on the back this latest news might arguably be a tad dramatic but – until such a time as the company is seen by the market as executing its turnaround effectively (near-term’s doubtful) – the widespread downbeat sentiment is unlikely to improve significantly.###5684||Empty###5685||Sign up for one of our email newsletters.

WASHINGTON — More than 20,000 taxpayers have been targeted by fake Internal Revenue Service agents in the largest phone scam of its kind the agency knows of, the IRS inspector general said on Thursday.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes and demand payment with a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration.

Legitimate IRS agents usually initiate contact by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early, the office said. But the scam has become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” he said in a statement. “The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming.”

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected.

The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the office said.

The scam has been effective in part because scammers mask caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of targets' Social Security numbers and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are not connected to a bank account.

Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores and use them just like a bank card until the money runs out or they add more.###5686||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

[WSJ] — Mark Maurer###5695||Is President Barack Obama trying to boost revenues for Russian-made credit cards? In his latest round of sanctions, he's banned Visa and MasterCard from operating in Russia, which could lure customers over to Putin-backed credit cards.

According to the Moscow Times, "Visa and MasterCard have stopped, without notification, providing services for payment transactions for clients at Russia's Bank Rossiya, the sanctions-hit bank said on Friday, Reuters reported."

Obama is punishing US-based credit card companies for allegedly supporting Crimea's annexation to Russia.

As reported by the Moscow Times, "The United States Treasury Department on Thursday published an updated list of individuals it was sanctioning for their involvement with Russia's absorption of Crimea or their role as part of President Vladimir Putin's "inner circle." It also stated that Bank Rossiya was on the list, "because it is controlled by, has acted for or on behalf of, or has provided material or other support to, senior Russian government officials."

Visa and MasterCard have been deemed as allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin and therefore, the global community must stand up and cut their Visa and MasterCards. The world welcomes their imminent demise.

Turkey’s telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to the social media network hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the website. Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis

Turkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country – to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.

President Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.

Sosyal medya platformlarının tamamen kapatılması tasvip edilemez. —

“I hope this implementation won’t last long,” he wrote.

Links to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan’s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.

Erdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.

“Prime Minister Erdogan’s move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Andrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain’s Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System – or DNS – blocking, which was easy to work around.

He said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google’s Domain Name System, which isn’t affected by the ban.

Earlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey’s lawyers’ association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey’s main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.

Twitter’s @policy account tweeted: “We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon.”

Earlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or “SMS.”

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey – a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.” Other EU officials also voiced concerns.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey’s minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders – although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy – not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating “personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives” and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

“Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,” Elvan said. “We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.”

Technology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.

The original source of the leaked recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news reports that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

“Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis,” said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch.

In Berlin, the German government’s human rights commissioner, Christoph Straesser, called on Turkey to reverse the decision immediately, saying “limiting freedom of the press and opinion on this scale is unacceptable.”

Britain’s Foreign Office also expressed concern, saying that social media has a “vital role to play” in modern democracy and helps promote transparency and public debate.###5697||Walmart is getting into the video game trade-in business once again. Starting March 26, Walmart will start accepting used games for Wii, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles at more than 3,100 U.S. Walmart locations.

For your aging game to qualify, you must bring in a working disc in its original packaging to Walmart's electronics department. After the game disc is checked for cracks and deep scratches, you'll receive a price quote for the amount Walmart is willing to pay.

Accepted games will receive their trade-in value in eGift cards that can be used at Walmart and Sam's club locations and online. Walmart's gift card policy is in line with other video game trade-in retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and Gamestop.

This is the second time Walmart has ventured into the used video game market, but the first time the company has managed the entire operation itself. In 2009, Walmart partnered with e-Play to bring automated video game trade-in kiosks into select Walmart stores in the U.S. The venture lasted less than a year, however, coming to an abrupt end in February 2010 after e-Play suspended operations, according to Joystiq.

This time around, Walmart wants to get its attempt at used games right and is launching with a more expansive program than the 80-store trial market with e-Play.

"With more than 110 million gamers in the U.S., we see enormous potential in the $2 billion pre-owned video game business opportunity," Walmart said in a blog post Tuesday.

Walmart didn't specify in its announcement exactly which console platforms its trade-in program will support. But Walmart Spokesperson Sarah McKinney told us the company will accept any game from any platform as long as the game has market value.

Walmart will start accepting games next Wednesday, but it doesn't plan on selling the used games in its stores until this summer. Used games will be sold at Walmart locations and online.

While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States.

The high price tag in America prompted questions from U.S. lawmakers on Friday, after U.S. health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill.

Gilead said it was "pleased to have finalized an agreement" for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.

"We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C," Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement.

Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with U.S.-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.

El-Adawi said Gilead's offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.

Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world's highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilised needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis.

Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie , Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections.

Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment - and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.

But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.

Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

Gilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.

The seller of beauty supplies is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm. It is also working with the U.S. Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Sally Beauty Holdings Inc., which is based in Denton, Texas, said Monday that it will provide more information on its website in coming days, including notification of affected consumers and others.

A spate of major data breaches in recent months has raised awareness about the vulnerability of cards used in the U.S.

Recent intrusions include those at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus. The Target breach compromised 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of up to 70 million customers. At Neiman Marcus, its breach may have compromised 1.1 million debit and credit cards.

Security experts have been long pushed for increased consumer protection through so-called EMV enabled credit and debit cards, which are already common in Europe. Most cards in the U.S. still feature magnetic strips.

Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard, which seek broader acceptance of EMV technology from retailers and ATMs, said that they are creating a group intended to help the retail and banking industries come together on more-secure credit card payments. Visa and MasterCard, which run the networks that carry the payments, said the group’s initial focus will be on chips embedded in newer credit cards that make them more secure.

NEW YORK � The �everyday low price� king is trying to shake up the world of pricing again.

Wal-Mart said it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products with those of its competitors. The world�s largest retailer began offering the feature that�s called �Savings Catcher� on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers such as Target and Best Buy are offering to match the lower prices of rivals � but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart�s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn�t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit-card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it�s successful, others might follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.�s U.S. discount division, said shoppers are looking for �technological answers to saving them money and time.�

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program will be rolled out nationwide, said it�s hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Walmart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart�s �everyday low price� model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper.

On top of that, the retailer�s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.###5707||* Short-term safe-haven bids for yen unwind

* United States, EU impose sanctions on Russia

* Euro firm despite Russia crisis, seen as safe haven

By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Michael Connor

NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors saw as modest economic sanctions against Russia and Ukraine following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow.

The dollar, often a shelter for investors against global stresses, was also down, with the dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, off 0.13 percent to 79.345 in afternoon trading.

“The market thinks, it’s not so bad,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets Online Trading in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. “You don’t see any signs of play against the euro. If the sanctions were serious, say against Russia’s oil and gas exports, you’d see selling of the euro because they don’t have much alternative for energy.”

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion in major markets. The absence of military conflict between the two countries also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia’s military incursion into Crimea. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, will impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday.

“The sanctions don’t sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In late New York trading, the dollar was up 0.3 percent against the yen at 101.66 yen, rising after four days of losses driven by investors buying the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.5 percent to 141.51 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.392, despite data showing a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe’s common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro’s strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn’t weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.2 percent versus the franc at 1.2159.###5708||China Telecom Corporation Ltd.: Press Release – 2013 Annual Results

"We call on Prime Minister Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society."

The prime minister made the threat to ban Twitter today in the western city of Bursa at a campaign rally for elections scheduled for March 30. Referring to an unspecified court order, the premier said, "We now have a court order. We'll eradicate Twitter. I don't care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic," the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported.###5714||Why did this happen?

According to New York Times, a Chinese satellite has spotted an object in the southern Indian Ocean that could be from the missing airliner. The object is close to the remote area of the ocean where a multinational search party has been looking for the Malaysia Airlines plane since the past two days.

Satellite images beamed by the China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), have spotted a large object that measures 74 feet by 24 feet (22.5 meters by 13 meters) in the ocean. The location of this object is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south west of the objects that were reported to have been sighted by a commercial satellite two days ago. According to Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein of Malaysia, Chinese ships would be sent to the location to verify if they were indeed from the Malaysia Airlines plane. SASTIND had spotted similar objects a few days ago which were later dismissed to be not from the plane.

It was on Thursday that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, revealed that an Australian commercial satellite had spotted large objects floating in a remote area in the Indian Ocean that could be from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. Since then, ships and planes combing the area were not able to find anything after two days of search. This new revelation by the Chinese authorities could be a breakthrough in what has been a depressing two weeks of search for the families and authorities. Meanwhile China has sent two military planes to Perth, where it would join other aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, USA and Japan for the massive search for the Malaysia Airlines plane.

Meanwhile, in a related Inquisitr report, we had mentioned that primary investigations by authorities which led to the unearthing of transcripts between the pilots of Malaysia Airlines and Air traffic controllers on the ground did not find anything amiss in the behavior of the pilots.

The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has become one of the most compelling mysteries in the history of aviation. The aircraft took off as a routine flight from Kula Lumpur on March 8 and was headed towards Beijing. On board the plane were 227 passengers and 12 crew members. After about two hours of normal flying, it disappeared from the radar screens that were tracking it – never to reappear again. Meanwhile the plane continued to ping an ACARS Inmarsat satellite for over 8 hours after its disappearance. The Rolls Royce manufactured engines from the Boeing 777 were designed to send reports to the UK monitoring center on a periodic basis using the satellite.

Do you think there is any chance that the Malaysia Airlines plane could have landed in some remote area of the planet where authorities haven’t looked at yet?

* Sees record sales in 2014 of more than 2 mln cars

* Launch of new models, higher production to drive sales

* Shares up 6.8 pct, biggest gainer on pan-European index (Removes extraneous text from headline)

By Edward Taylor

MUNICH, March 19 (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker BMW is looking at raising production capacity at its plant in the United States and releasing 12 new models as it chases record sales and a rise in pretax profit of up to 10 percent this year.

BMW’s plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is being readied to reach an annual production capacity of around 350,000 vehicles, up from 300,000 at the end of 2013. It makes sport utility vehicles including the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models.

“The U.S. will stay a market with great potential for us. This is why we are evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity in the U.S.”, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company’s annual results press conference on Wednesday.

Analysts welcomed the outlook from the Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands.

“We see BMW’s confidence as a major positive trigger for the stock,” analysts at ISI Global said in a note to clients.

BMW shares were up 6.8 percent at 86.207 euros at 1301 GMT, the biggest gainers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .

Reithofer declined to give a figure about future production levels at Spartanburg, or comment on whether BMW is thinking about producing a new model, the X7. The carmaker said it will make a further announcement about its U.S. plans on March 28.

Investments made at plants in China will allow BMW to raise production capacity there to 400,000 cars, from 300,000 in 2013.

BMW reiterated its aim to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014 to 2 million or more, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

“We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions,” Reithofer said.

Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner later said a “significant rise” meant “somewhere in the range of a high single-digit and a double-digit amount.”

Last week, BMW reported its automotive division’s fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

The forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable and on a steady recovery in European markets, BMW said.

BMW expects significant growth in markets outside Europe including high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in China.

The car maker said it expected sales in the second half of 2014 to be higher than in the first six months as a result of a large number of model launches, including the compact 2-series coupe and the 2-series Active Tourer.

BMW is also launching the i8, a diesel hybrid sportscar made of carbon fiber, later this year with a starting price of around 126,000 euros.

BMW board member for sales and marketing Ian Robertson said the i8 will have an initial production run of 1,000 vehicles.

BMW will make greater use of carbon fiber in other models from its vehicle range, and is developing the next generation Z4 roadster together with Toyota Motor Corp., Robertson said.

Separately, BMW published it annual report, which showed that CEO Reithofer received total compensation of 7.03 million euros in 2013, a 6 percent increase on the previous year.

Newslook

Wal-Mart's got game.

The world's largest retailer on Tuesday announced plans to seriously expand its video game trade-in program to its stores. Customer who bring in used video games can receive store credit -- but not cash -- at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores beginning March 26.

Until now, Wal-Mart offered trade-ins on a much more limited basis online.

For Wal-Mart, like most major retailers, it's about about driving more customers into the store and boosting revenue. Retailers like Wal-Mart and McDonald's that more widely appeal to lower-income customers have faced a tough time battling back from the economic downturn. These customers face bleaker employment prospects and many don't have extra money to spend.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.

Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Wal-Mart.com. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," added Mac Naughton.

Walmart is making plans to begin accepting trade-in video games on March 26, which will put a little bit of heat on GameStop, and other video game stores.

According to GameSpot, Walmart will begin taking trade-ins in 3,100 stores across the U.S, and will give consumers gift cards back as payment. This makes Walmart a little more enticing because the gift card can be used for other purchases within the store, whereas GameStop, they only have games to offer.

GameSpot reported, Walmart will send their games to a refurbishing center and get the games certified. They will also only be taking games and not consoles and hardware.

"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good," said Mac Naughton to GameSpot after being asked why the sudden change. "We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges."

Naughton also said they are planning to give back more money than any other video game trade-in place, pricing the average title at $35.

The NYTimes reported on the incredible profits on used games. It is a $2.4 billion global industry for GameStop alone, which is 27 percent of its sales. In America, GameStop made $1.6 billion on used games and hardware sales alone.

"It's extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins," said Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities to the NYTimes.

Used games are a touchy subject and a source of contention among developers and console makers as used game sales take away from new games sales, costing companies millions of dollars. However, it is a necessary evil because gamers will keep buying and selling games to grow their collections.

Microsoft tried to implement a used game system on the Xbox One that would require gamers to only register a game twice, and not work with used games. After public outcry, they reversed the policy.###5722||Photo by AMSA via Getty Images

The big news from overnight in the search for MH370, via the Associated Press:

Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in northeast Ohio.

An Australian search and rescue official says that planes have been sent to check on two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight that were spotted on satellite imagery in the Indian Ocean about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth.

But John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority cautioned Thursday against expectations that this may help solve the mystery of the plane that went missing with 239 people on board nearly two weeks ago. Young told reporters, "We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sited close-up."

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. One of the objects spotted was said to be 24 meters (nearly 80 feet) in length and the other 5 meters (about 15 feet) long. Both were in an area that officials described as being about a four-hour flight off Australia's southwestern coast.

The satellite images represent the first significant new lead investigators have had in days, but there is still plenty of reason for caution. This search has already contained more than its fair share of red herrings, including (most notably in this particular case) satellite images released by China in the days after the jetliner went missing that appeared to show debris floating roughly in the area the 777 disappeared from air traffic control radar. A search of that area, however, turned up nothing and investigators have since shifted their attention to the opposite side of the Malaysian peninsula and well beyond.

The new images were actually recorded four days ago—on March 16—but were somewhat lost in the shuffle given the massive scale of the area being searched. "Due to the volume of imagery being searched, and the detailed process of analysis that followed," the info wasn't brought to the attention of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority until Thursday morning local time, according to an official statement from the agency.



Australia quickly dispatched four planes to investigate the area in question—described as a 23,000 square-kilometer area about 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth—but the search produced no debris sightings by the end of the day local time. (The fact that it's a four-hour flight out and a four-hour one back isn't making things any easier for the planes doing the sweep.) The search will begin again Friday morning, according to officials.

Visa and Mastercard stock movements

The stock price of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) traded in the range opened at $223.17 per share and then it fluctuated from $219.70 to $232.6 per share and eventually closed at $223.37, up by 0.70%.

On the other hand, the equities of Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) opened at $79.34 per share. The stock traded from $79.50 per share to $79.83 a share and eventually closed at $75.99 per share, down by 3.09%.

Court of Appeals ruling on Debit Card Swipe Fees

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated that the Federal Reserve ensure that interchange fees reflect the actual cost of processing debit cards transactions. In order to comply with the law, the Federal Reserve initially proposed limiting the fees to $0.12 per debit card transaction, but finally set it to $0.21 per swipe with the possibility of a few cents increase to cover some costs such as fraud. Prior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.

Several retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) among others filed a case requesting a federal judge to nullify the ruling of the Federal Reserve. Last year, a District Court Judge in Washington tossed the Federal Reserve rule and cited that it misinterpreted the Dodd-Frank law. District Court Judge Richard Leon opined that the Fed rule “utterly indefensible” interpretation and “runs completely afoul of the text, design and purpose” of the Dodd-Frank law.

Today, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees. However, the court noted that the Dodd-Frank amendment was written poorly and a clarification is necessary to determine the appropriate cap for debit card transaction fees. The Court of Appeal said, “Its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”

Analysts’ comments

In a note to investors, Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies believed that the ruling of the Court of Appeals is positive for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) as it eliminates concerns regarding its superior U.S. signature debit market share being eroded by increased competition, which should have been the case if the fed lost the exclusivity part of the appeal.

Kupferberg believe that the ruling will “likely be an incremental positive” for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and it “would reduce potential risks of further downward pressure on debit network fees paid by issuers.”

On the other hand, analysts at JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) opined that the ruling was a “big win” for the payments industry particularly for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) because it can keep its 70% share in the signature debit card market.###5724||Empty###5725||Empty###5726||ISS crew members willing to grab the camera and post on Twitter are met with a huge following.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept. The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam's Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com.

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary, the company said.

Walmart stated that customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com, later this year. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

THE missing Malaysia Airlines plane went down in the Indian Ocean presumably killing all those on board, authorities said after viewing new satellite data.

Malaysia Airlines has informed the relatives of those aboard missing flight MH370 that they believe no one on the plane survived.

The following SMS message was sent to relatives: “Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived. ... we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a 1am AEDT news conference that a new analysis of satellite data showed that the missing plane plunged into the southern Indian Ocean.

Mr Najib said the Inmarsat satellite company had employed never-before used technology and found that MH370 flew along the southern corridor.

“Its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean west of Perth,” he said 17 days after MH370 disappeared enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board.

“This is a remote location far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness that I regret that I must inform you that according to this new data that MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.

“The past few weeks have been heartbreaking. I know this news must be harder still.”

The news was greeted with an outpouring of grief by the relatives of passengers, whose agonising wait to find out what happened is now apparently over.

Relatives of Chinese passengers, who were the overwhelming majority of those on the plane, were called to a hotel near the airport in Beijing to hear the announcement. Afterward, they filed out of a conference room in heart-wrenching grief.

One woman collapsed and fell on her knees, crying “My son! My son!”

The overnight developments came after Prime Minster Tony Abbott announced that two “objects” were located by a RAAF P3 Orion in the search for MH370.

Mr Abbott told Parliament the first object was grey or green and circular and the second was orange and rectangular.

Distraught family members of those on board were being booked on charter flights to take them to Perth to be near the expected salvage operation.

News_Image_File: Bearer of bad news ... Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak after his press conference.

HMAS Success is in the vicinity of the possible debris, about 2500km southwest of Perth, and hopes to be there within hours to recover the objects.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority emergency response division general manager John Young said the P3 Orion had to leave before the HMAS Success arrived last night and it was possible the ship would have to wait until the first light of morning to find the objects.

MH370 WAS CO-PILOT’S FIRST 777 FLIGHT WITHOUT MINDER

“Relocation is proving difficult. That is partially a function of the poor visibility and the fact that the aircraft are a long way apart. It is quite difficult to get the next aircraft or the next ship into the spot to take over the watching where the object is because they are all at the end of their endurance and have to leave,” he said.

“You may find that we will be doing this for maybe three or four more days before we are confident that we have either found all of the objects there, or if they are there we simply can’t find them. And that’s the plan.”

News_Image_File: Searching for answers ... HMAS Success is nearby and will be there within hours to recover the objects.

Earlier in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein had told a media conference that the new items had not yet been identified or linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

“Two orange objects, approximately one metre in length, and one white-coloured drum were sighted by search aircraft, but remain unidentified and have not been conclusively linked to MH370,” he said.

News_Image_File: On the way ... the commanding officer of HMAS Success, Captain Allison Norris of the Royal Australian Navy.

“HMAS Success detected two radar targets within the search area but could not locate the targets on further investigation of the area.

“Earlier today a Chinese search plane reportedly sighted objects within the Australian search area. These objects are not in the vicinity of those that were identified by Australian authorities last week.

“A few minutes ago the (Malaysian) Prime Minister received a call from the Prime Minister of Australia who informed him that an Australian search aircraft had located two objects in the Australian search area — one circular and one rectangular.

“HMAS Success is in the vicinity and it is possible that the objects could be received within the next few hours or by tomorrow morning at the latest.”

News_Image_File: Items located ... Malaysian PM Najib Razak takes the call from Tony Abbott.

Mr Abbott said an RAAF P3 Orion located the two objects about 2.45pm AEDT.

The PM said a US Navy Poseidon, a second Australian Royal Australian Orion and a Japanese Orion are also en route to the search area.

“I caution again ... that we don’t know whether any of these objects are from MH370, they could be flotsam,’’ he told Parliament.

“Nevertheless we are hopeful that we can recover these objects soon and they will take us a step closer to resolving this tragic mystery.’’

News_Image_File: On a mission ... Prime Minister Tony Abbott says a US Navy Poseidon, a second Australian Royal Australian Orion and a Japanese Orion are also on the way to the search area.

Hishammuddin said Malaysian police have interviewed over 100 people, including the families of both the pilot and co-pilot.

“As far as the transcript is concerned, the technical committee is considering releasing it and we will keep you informed about the decision,” he said.

“The Inspector General of the Police will attend tomorrow’s press conference to answer further questions on the investigation.

“We can also confirm that MH370 was carrying wooden pallets. However, there is as yet no evidence that these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the Australian search area.”

Hishammuddin said France has now provided two lots of images of potential debris from MH370.

EXPERTS SAY NEW FINDINGS ‘COULD BE LIFE RAFTS’

Paul Edwards, former chief of staff of British Army Aviation, told Britain’s Sky News the sightings were “quite significant”.

“It is certainly encouraging because of the shape, because of the colour orange obviously, it could be from the aircraft.

“The good news is that the aircraft has spotted it and surface ships are in the area which means that quite quickly we’re going to get an Australian warship alongside to get eyes on it, and actually identify it and — if it’s small — fish it out of the sea. To me that’s quite a significant development and very encouraging.

“(As it’s only been) a short time, there’s more chance of getting there and, crucially, actually identifying it.”

News_Image_File: Duty ... Leading Seaman Luke Horsburgh stands watch on the bridge of HMAS Success during the search for MH370.

Professor Chris Bellamy, from Britain’s Greenwich Maritime Institute, said the orange items could possibly be life rafts.

“I’m afraid that doesn’t give much hope that there will be anybody in the life rafts. If the plane broke up then the slides might have inflated automatically,” he told Sky News UK.

“We’re against the clock here because in the 16 or 17 days since the plane disappeared that stuff could have gone an awfully long way.”

The development comes after Chinese aircrew earlier spotted objects in the search area off Perth.

News_Image_File: Hunt for clues ... the families of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his co-pilot Fariq Hamad have been interviewed, say Malaysian officials. Picture: YouTubeThe official Xinhua news agency said earlier on Monday that “white and square” objects were spotted by searchers on board a Chinese Ilyushin-76 plane, which was on its way back to Perth at the time of the sighting.

US Navy P8 Poseidon was unable to relocate the objects after it was tasked to investigate the reported sightings by the Chinese aircraft at 33,000ft.

At the request of the RAAF, one Australian pilot was on board the Chinese plane to join the search.

Chinese icebreaker Xuelong changed its course and was heading towards the area.

Multiple countries are now helping in the search with new satellite images pushing the Australian-led operation towards further areas of potential debris.

Civil and military aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, the US, China and Japan are all taking part in the massive hunt for the Malaysia Airlines plane, which disappeared more than 16 days ago with 239 people on board.

After a fruitless day of searching yesterday, satellite images from France provided some fresh impetus. They were reportedly taken on Friday although few details have been released.

“Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor. Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre,” the transport ministry said in a statement in Kuala Lumpur.

While the statement from Malaysia called the information “new satellite images’’, France’s Foreign Ministry said they were “radar echoes”. It is thought the radar echoes — electronic signals — had been converted into fuzzy images.

PLANE FLEW AS LOW AS 3650 METRES BEFORE VANISHING

New evidence supports previous eyewitness accounts that the missing Malaysian airliner flew as low as 3650 metres over Malaysia before it vanished.

Military radar tracking showed the plane changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea and headed back over the peninsula towards the Straits of Malacca, according to a source close to the investigation, CNN reports.

The Boeing 777 with 239 people on board flew as low as 3650 metres feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source.

Malaysian authorities have not confirmed the CNN report.

‘PALLET’ MYSTERY

So far there has been nothing concrete found, only the grainy satellite images and a visual sighting of what appeared to be a wooden pallet which has yet to be located.

Authorities co-ordinating the search yesterday sent planes and a ship to try to “re-find’’ the pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colours.

It was seen Saturday by spotters on a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate it could not find it.

News_Image_File: Objects ... satellite imagery from AMSA.

“That’s the nature of it,’’ AMSA aircraft operations co-ordinator Mike Barton said. “You only have to be off by a few hundred metres in a fast-travelling aircraft.’’

AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.

READ MORE: WHEN TRAGEDY TURNS TO GRIM ROUTINE

“We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry,’’ Mr Barton said. “They’re usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft ... It’s a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well.”

News_Image_File: More data ... the Chinese satellite image.

During a visit to Papua New Guinea, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the satellite images were good leads but it was “still too early to be definite”.

“But obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope — no more than hope, no more than hope — that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,” he said.

LARGE FLOATING OBJECTS

On Saturday it was revealed that a Chinese satellite had picked up what appeared to be a floating object, about 22.5 metres by 13 metres. It was seen about 120km from the position where an Australian satellite image showed what also appeared to be debris of about 24 metres in length.

News_Image_File: On the lookout ... Japan’s P-3C Orion arrives to help in the search. Pic: Jason Reed.

One of the objects located by the French satellite on Friday was estimated to be about the same size as the object captured by the Chinese satellite (22 metres by 13 metres), according to a Malaysian official, who declined to be identified because he isn’t authorised to speak to the media.

It was not possible to determine precise dimensions from the French data, the official said.

The Australian image was taken on March 16 and the Chinese image was taken on March 18.

Authorities have not yet officially revealed what date the French image was taken or what it showed.

News_Image_File: First light ... a Japanese P-3C Orion readies to join the search.

The southern Indian Ocean is thought to be a potential area to find the jet because Malaysian authorities have said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled.

They are unsure what happened next.

‘MYSTERY CALL’ DENIED

Malaysian police have denied that a mystery phone call was made to Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the missing plane.

It was reported earlier that a mystery woman called the captain before takeoff, raising fears about his motives.

The Mail Online reported that the captain’s phone records revealed he took a two-minute phone call from a woman using a mobile phone number obtained under a false identity.

But Assistant Commissioner Datin Asmawati Ahmad dismissed the report as “mere speculations”.

“Please be advised that the Royal Malaysia Police take no responsibility over the dissemination of such information which originates from unnamed and unverified sources. The news in the tabloid are mere speculations,” Asst Comm Ahmad said in a statement.

“We would like to draw your kind attention to the fact that the news was picked up from a foreign tabloid which has no exclusive rights to the details of our investigations.

“Secondly the IGP has never issued any public statement that categorically places the MH370 investigation under an act of terrorism.”

RELATIVES STILL FURIOUS

Earlier in Beijing, a Malaysian Government team had spent a marathon six hours briefing relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on the plane. It was the third meeting and comes after criticism by Chinese relatives that they were being kept in the dark about the search.

“The government wishes to reiterate its commitment and continued engagement with the relatives of those on board MH370,” the Transport Ministry said.

Some relatives were still dissatisfied, however.

“I’m so furious,’’ said one woman after the meeting in Beijing. “I watch the television every day. Very often I feel like I’m about to go insane. My emotions are all over the place. I asked the Malaysians to give the answers and they said they couldn’t.”

This weekend’s Formula One grand prix in Malaysia is also causing problems, with relatives of passengers on the missing flight forced to move hotels.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.

NEW YORK | The "Every Day Low Price" king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.



Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.



The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.



Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.



The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.



Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.'s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for "technological answers to saving them money and time."



Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.



The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's "every day low price" model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.



As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.



Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.



Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.



Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.



The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.



The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.



Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.



Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.



As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.



"They're doing the work for me," said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. "The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away."###5731||The royal mint

A new shape for the £1 coin has been revealed which is said to be the most secure coin in the world.

The new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one, but has 12 edges and is both gold and silver coloured.

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983. There are concerns that it has become too easy to copy illegally.

It's thought around 45million fake £1 coins exist. The new coin will be introduced in 2017.

The Queen's portrait appears on one side of the coin and a competition will be held to decide what goes on the other side.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, said: "It is our aim to produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting."###5732||Indiana’s unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been since September 2008, but House Minority Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, said officials need to “take a longer look before gushing praise.”



According to the Department of Workforce Development in a report issued Monday, Indiana’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points, to 6.4 percent, in January. That is lower than all neighboring states and 0.2 percentage points below the national average.



“Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today’s unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a prepared statement. “Indiana’s rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow.”



The Hoosier state added 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector in January, the most in the country. But Indiana also lost 7,100 private sector jobs, leaving the state at a net loss of 2,500 jobs for the month.



“While others may gush about ‘the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years,’ I look at the report and find myself wondering many things,” Pelath said.



He noted all but one of the state’s metropolitan statistical areas – and 82 of the 92 counties – actually saw unemployment rise in January.



“These disparities only serve to heighten the concern that many of us have about the so-called ‘job creation’ engine that the governor, his administration, and his super-majorities like to tout so often,” Pelath said.



But Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center, said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the recent administration’s job-creation strategies.



He said the Hoosier economy is closely tied to the national economy so these numbers may be result of the general economic upswing throughout the country.



But Conover also said Indiana has a “well-deserved” reputation as a business-friendly state. The legislature recently passed a bill that will give Indiana the lowest corporate tax rate in the country.



The lowering of the business personal property tax was one of the landmark items of the Pence agenda.



“With this legislative session’s accomplishments in cutting the corporate income tax rate, giving counties new tools for reforming the business personal property tax, and offering new opportunities for career education and retraining, we continue to work hard to ensure the future economic prosperity of our state,” Pence said.



The DWD – along with the U.S. Federal Reserve – cited January’s severe winter weather as one of the main reasons for a loss of jobs around the country.



Conover agreed with the assessment and noted that more than 9,000 jobs were lost in the areas of trade, transportation and utilities, and construction alone.



But that explanation was not enough for Pelath.



“People can talk about seasonal adjustments all they want, but I continue to be concerned about the raw employment and unemployment numbers,” he said. “Those tell me who has a job and who is able to take care of their family.”



Pence agreed that there is still more work to be done.



“Amidst this good news, we know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy,” he said. “Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve Indiana’s economic climate, to attract more jobs, and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future."###5733||The £1 coin is to be replaced by a new model based on the old threepenny bit, George Osborne will announce in the Budget.

The Chancellor will say that the current coin, which has been in circulation for 30 years, is no longer suitable for use because it has become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

The new 12-sided coin will be as secure as modern banknotes and will save taxpayers’ money by cutting down on millions of pounds worth of fraud.

“After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,” the Chancellor is expected to tell MPs.

The Royal Mint estimates that about 45m £1 coins in circulation are now forgeries.

The Government expects the new coin to be introduced in 2017.

As with all British coins, the Queen’s effigy will be on the “heads side”. However, there will now be a public competition to decide the design for the “tails” side of the coin.

The Treasury said: “With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

“We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

A source said that the new coin, which will be roughly the same size as the current £1, will still fit in supermarket trolleys, parking meters and vending machines.

The threepenny bit was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. It replaced the old silver threepence, known as a "Joey".

It was particularly popular during the Second World War, when its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during blackouts.

By the time of decimalisation 1.2bn of the coins had been issued for circulation.

A Bank of England spokesman said: “The Bank welcomes [the] news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”

Kelvin Reynolds, director of policy and public affairs at the British Parking Association, said: “Parking operators have long expressed concerns about a rise in counterfeit £1 coins and the inconvenience this causes to motorists when coins are rejected by parking payment machines and the losses incurred as a result.”

The eligible borrowers, who are seeking ideal home purchase or refinancing home loans from TD Bank this Friday, will have to deal with the same interest rates as yesterday, which will certainly not have any serious impact on the overall demand of its loan products in the market.

Today, in the standard, long term home loan department, 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loan deals are being advertised at an interest rate of 4.438% and are carrying an annual percentage rate of 4.551% today. However, in the relatively shorter home financing section, the bank is offering its 15 year fixed rate mortgage home loan deals at an interest rate of 3.438% and an annual return rate of 3.632% this Friday.

With regards to the flexible home loan options, the potential customers can find the best 3 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans being listed against an interest rate of 2.688% and being backed by an APR yield of 2.839% to begin with. On the other hand, the 5 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans are now coming out at an interest price of 3.062% and are backed by an APR yield of 2.961% during the starting years of the home loan tenure.

For the borrowers, who are interested in securing more flexible home loan deals, the bank is offering its best 7 year adjustable rate mortgage packages at a starting interest rate of 3.438% and an annual return rate of 3.172% to start with. Alternatively, the 10 year adjustable rate mortgage home loan deals can be locked in at a lending rate of 3.688% and an annual percentage rate of 3.431% today.

Shifting sights towards the refinancing division, the customers who are looking forward to refinance their existing investments, can spot the popular 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loans being published at an interest rate of 4.688% and being backed by an APR yield of 4.803% today. On the other hand, the short term, 15 year counterparts of the 30 year refinancing fixed rate mortgage home loan plans can be acquired at an interest rate of 3.688% and an APR yield of 3.883% this Friday.

As far as the flexible home loan deals are concerned, the Canadian mortgage lender is providing the 5 year refinancing adjustable rate home loans at a starting interest price of 3.312% and an APR yield of 3.048% to start with. However, the more flexible, 7 year refinancing adjustable rate mortgage home loan options can be seen tagged with an interest cost of 3.688% and offering an APR yield of 3.290% on the basic amount of home loan acquired from the bank.

The cable operator, which generates about $500 million in annual revenue from its Los Angeles system, owes $7.2 million in fees for 2010 and 2011, and $2.5 million in fees from 2008 and 2009, according to the complaint.

TWC said in a prepared statement that it believes the lawsuit is without merit. "As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen," TWC said in the statement.

As The Los Angeles Times noted, the lawsuit was filed a few weeks after TWC announced that it would hike subscription fees on its cable systems in Southern California by about 6 percent on average.

Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle Corporation's previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals.

On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors' targets.

Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion.

She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts' consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said.

"They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story," said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. "Investors need to see more. It continues to be a 'prove me' stock in the eyes of investors."

The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit.

SOFTWARE BUSINESS STILL WEAK

Revenue from Oracle Corporation's hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company's $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company's core software business, said Ives.

Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

In response, four-decade-old Oracle Corporation has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc.

"They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example," said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. "They're playing catch up, but they're working quickly and they're starting to make some progress."

On Tuesday's call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.

On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle Corporation is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company's salesforce last year.

"We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now," Hurd said. "We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer."

Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.

Most of Oracle's business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.

Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.

For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.

Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.

Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Morning Glory tanker was due to arrive later on Saturday at Libya's government-controlled Zawiya port after being seized by U.S. commandos and escorted back through international waters by the U.S. Navy, Libyan officials said.

Hours before the handover, at least 16 people were wounded when Libyan rebels occupying three eastern oil ports clashed with troops and attacked an army base, where pro-government forces had been preparing to break the rebel blockade.

Anti-aircraft gunfire and explosions were heard overnight and after dawn on Saturday in Ajdabiya, the hometown of rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran, whose fighters seized the ports last summer to demand a greater share in Libya's oil resources.

The struggle for control of Libya's vital petroleum resources is one of the key challenges facing the weak central government, which has still failed to secure the North African country three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.

Brigades of former anti-Gaddafi rebels and militias refuse to disarm and often use armed force or control of oil facilities to make demands on a state whose army is still in training.

U.S. special forces boarded and seized the Morning Glory tanker last Sunday off Cyprus, days after it left Libya with a cargo of crude from one port, Es Sider, occupied by Jathran's men who had vowed to export oil themselves to resist Tripoli.

"The handover took place in international waters off the coast of Libya, and the Government of Libya and its security forces are now in control of the vessel," the U.S. embassy said in a statement.

Once the Morning Glory docks, crude from the tanker will be fed into Zawiya refinery, which has been forced to lower its production because of a protest at another oil facility, the El Sharara oilfield, officials at Zawiya port said.

Zawiya port is 55 km (34 miles) west of the capital Tripoli.

The Tripoli government gave Jathran a two-week deadline on March 12 to end his port blockade or face a military assault, though analysts say Libya's nascent armed forces may struggle to carry out that threat.

Jathran's self-declared Cyrenaica government is demanding more autonomy for his eastern region. Attempts to broker a deal between the rebels and Tripoli have so far failed.

LANA state news agency said tribal community leaders helped stop the fighting earlier on Saturday between the rebels and Libyan soldiers. But the agency reported 16 people were wounded.

SPLITS, RIVALRIES

After months of threats, Jathran's federalist gunmen managed to load crude onto the Morning Glory tanker. The ship left port and escaped Libya's navy, embarrassing Tripoli's government and prompting parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

The seizure of the tanker in international waters was a rare boost for the government, which has struggled to end a standoff that has cost the state more than $7 billion in lost revenue.

The three rebel-held ports account for around 700,000 barrels per day of Libya's oil export capacity, or around half of its total petroleum shipments.

The town where Saturday's battle broke out, Ajdabiya, is divided between Jathran supporters and those who fear his oil blockade will lead to the collapse of the state.

But any major assault on the three ports may bolster support for Jathran's cause for a federalist state.

Tripoli's government is also stymied by infighting among Islamists, secular parties and tribes that has delayed Libya's transition to democracy since the fall of Gaddafi, whose one-man rule left few state institutions.

Western governments, which backed NATO's air strikes to help the 2011 anti-Gaddafi revolt, are training Libya's armed forces and are pressing the factions to reach a political settlement.

(Writing by Patrick Markey; Editing by Gareth Jones)###5748||Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attracted fresh criticism in EU circles after banning Twitter.

The EU commissioner on digital affairs, Neelie Kroes, tweeted on Thursday (20 March) that the move “is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl [international] community will see this as censorship. It is.”

Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, himself a prolific user of the US micro-blogging site, noted: “Erdogan is not only damaging himself, but his entire nation.”

The EU’s former ambassador to Turkey, Marc Pierini, now an analyst at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels, said: “Turkey is estranging itself from the world.”

The ban entered into force shortly before midnight on Thursday.

It came just a few hours after Erdogan at a party rally in Bursa, near Istanbul, ahead of local elections on 30 March, said: “We now have a court order. We will dig up Twitter and so on - all of them - by the roots… I don't care what the international community says. They will see the Turkish republic's strength.”

His press service later noted: “It is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens.”

The “court rulings” refer to a Twitter account called Haramzadeler, meaning “son of thieves” in Turkish, which has been publishing leaked documents on alleged corruption in Erdogan’s inner circle.

The Haramzadeler leaks are part of wider anti-Erdogan exposures which began late last year, when he fell out with Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic teacher living in the US, over education reforms.

A Turkish official told Reuters “at the moment there is no [similar] decision for other social media like Facebook.”

The Twitter ban comes after Turkey in February passed a new law giving authorities the right to block access to websites if they are seen as having "insulting” content.

It also comes after Erdogan established political control over judicial appointments and fired hundreds of policemen and prosecutors looking into the corruption affair.

Even before the new measures, Turkey already ranked among the lowest of the low in terms of free speech.

It arrested more government-critical journalists than China or Iran last year, while the Twitter ban puts it in the company of China, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, and Pakistan.

Some MEPs have said accession talks, revived last year after a long gap, should once again be put on hold, while some EU officials, in private conversations, have likened Erdogan to Europe’s Communist-era autocrats.

Amid mounting, and at times deadly, clashes between young anti-government protesters and Erdogan’s police, the Twitter ban also risks backfiring inside Turkey, which has more than 12 million Twitter users.

Twitter itself noted that users can get round the ban by posting tweets via SMS-es from their mobile phones.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey trended to the top of worldwide postings on the site late on Thursday and early on Friday, with the majority of the #TwitterisblockedinTurkey posts coming from inside Turkey despite the restriction.

The ruling issued Friday by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a lower court’s decision in July that favored the merchants and was a setback for banks.

In the July ruling, a federal judge struck down the Fed’s cap on so-called “swipe fees,” saying the Fed didn’t have the authority to set the limit the way it did in 2011, improperly including data that made the cap too high.

The retail groups had sued the Fed over its setting the cap at an average of about 24 cents per debit-card transaction. The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.

Congress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.

The retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.

The three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.

The National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.

“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”

The Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.

The banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Hunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”

“Make no doubt about it – consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.

The American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.

The fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.

Banks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.

Banks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.

The retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.

The Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, a big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop, based on an industry fixed-rate system that allowed lower rates for companies with bigger customer volume. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.

The Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.###5755||Empty###5756||Empty###5757||Why did this happen?

The seller of beauty supplies is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm. It is also working with the U.S. Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Sally Beauty Holdings Inc., which is based in Denton, Texas, said Monday that it will provide more information on its website in coming days, including notification of affected consumers and others.

A spate of major data breaches in recent months has raised awareness about the vulnerability of cards used in the U.S.

Recent intrusions include those at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus. The Target breach compromised 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of up to 70 million customers. At Neiman Marcus, its breach may have compromised 1.1 million debit and credit cards.

Security experts have been long pushed for increased consumer protection through so-called EMV enabled credit and debit cards, which are already common in Europe. Most cards in the U.S. still feature magnetic strips.

Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard, which seek broader acceptance of EMV technology from retailers and ATMs, said that they are creating a group intended to help the retail and banking industries come together on more-secure credit card payments. Visa and MasterCard, which run the networks that carry the payments, said the group’s initial focus will be on chips embedded in newer credit cards that make them more secure.

For the second time in less than two years, Symantec Corp. has a new chief executive officer.

In a that surprised observers, the Mountain View, Calif-based security and storage vendor Thursday fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named board member Michael Brown as his interim replacement.

In a statement, Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said Bennett's organizational realignment and cost cutting efforts have positioned the company for future growth.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth," Schulman said.

The decision to terminate Bennett "was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," he added.

Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as Symantec CEO in July 2012. He was president and CEO of Intuit between 2000 and 2007 and joined Symantec's board in 2010.

In the 20 months or so that he was at the helm, Bennett did a decent job of managing the company, said Gene Ruth, lead Symantec analyst at Gartner.

"Bennett brought business acumen to Symantec," Ruth said. "He was a business architect type of person. My observation was that he was rearranging the organization and repositioning it," by bringing in new people and refreshing the company culture. "He was redirecting them to be more focused on delivering products that customers really wanted."

Some of the changes being implemented by Bennett required time to take hold, time he wasn't given. It doesn't happen in a month. But it looks like the board was not patient." Ruth said.

As recently as November, Gartner gave Symantec a positive rating for its efforts, Ruth noted. The chief criticisms at that time were that Symantec had to better realign its sales force and address some support issues related to one of its core data backup products.

"In general they were holding their own. It wasn't like they were grabbing a lot of market share, [but] it wasn't like they were losing market share." Clearly for Symantec's board though, maintaining market share does not appear to have been enough, Ruth said.

Newly named interim CEO Brown has been on Symantec's board of directors since the company acquired Veritas Software in July 2005. Brown sat on the Veritas board.

He was previously chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

Symantec today said the move won't impact its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The company still expects revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion, down from $1.74 billion in the same period last year, Symantec noted.

The company has already raised more than $300 million in funding, but the WSJ reports Airbnb is in “advanced talks” to raise an additional $400 million to $500 million.

With that report as a backdrop, Airbnb has shared some stats this morning that show its guests increasingly are traveling to, from, or in-between nations in Europe. In a blog post today, the company said that 50 percent of its guests over the last year were from Europe, and that number is only expected to grow over time.

Airbnb said that more than a million guests each from the U.K. and France have booked stays through its platform. Meanwhile, more than a million guests have stayed at places listed on Airbnb in both Italy and Spain. It’s likely that those guests and stays overlapped quite a bit — according to the company, more than 80 percent of European guests staying with Airbnb traveled to other destinations within Europe.

The growth comes as Airbnb has been investing in the continent over recent years — in 2012, the company opened offices in London, Paris, Barcelona, and Milan, among other European cities.

Airbnb has had a particularly international audience for a while, with three-quarters of all stays involving a stay by an international guest or a guest staying in an international listing. But this announcement marks a serious shift in the makeup of Airbnb guests. Back in 2011, about half of all guests were from the U.S., but that’s dropped to below 30 percent.

That said, the company expects its growth in Europe to accelerate even further. It forecasts that the number of European guests staying in unique listings will more than double in 2014.

That’s great news for a company that had already shown impressive growth in 2013 — seeing its overall stays jump from a total of 4 million at the beginning of the year to 11 million by the end of it.

Airbnb’s valuation is also seeing a big increase, according to the WSJ. Its last funding round of $200 million led by Founders Fund valued it at $2.5 billion, while the latest raise, which is expected to include private-equity firm TPG, values the company at around $10 billion.

For what it’s worth, Airbnb declined to comment on the report of new funding.###5767||McDONALDS TO GET 47% REDUCTION IN GRAFTON STREET RENT - McDonald's fast food chain is to have its rent reduced by 47% on Dublin's Grafton Street less than two weeks before the Supreme Court is due to review a separate High Court ruling that the rent on another Grafton Street café, Bewley's, must be allowed to fall in line with the depressed open market rate. The background to the two rental arrangements are entirely different, writes the Irish Times. McDonald's has negotiated a lower rent under a new lease agreement while the Bewley's lease is still subject to five yearly upwards-only reviews. McDonald's had been paying an overall rent of €1.15 million under a 35-year lease which ran out at the end of 2011. That figure has now dropped to €600,000 and with upwards-only clauses no longer allowed, five yearly reviews are now based primarily on open market rental values. The landlords in this case - Royal London Mutual Life and Pension Fund - had indicated in advance of the review that it would also be looking for a premium of at least 30% on the rent to take account of the scarcity value of having a round-the-clock food business on the city's premier high street and also because of the sheer size of the building - it extends to 1,858sq m (20,000sq ft). Natalie Brennan of CBRE said the issue of the premium "was factored into the discussions and was taken on board". Grafton Street earned a reputation during the property boom for being one of the most expensive high streets in the world.

BANK OF IRELAND TO SCRAP 'DELEVERAGING' ROLE FOLLOWING DONOVAN'S RETIREMENT - Bank of Ireland will not appoint a new head of its "non-core division" following the retirement of previous head Denis Donovan, the Irish Independent has learned. As well as heading up the unit, Mr Donovan sat on the group executive committee, the team under chief executive Richie Boucher that oversees the day-to-day running of the bank. Following his retirement the role of head of group non-core division is "no longer required", according to an internal memo sent to staff and seen by the newspaper. The group non-core division was responsible for meeting a "deleveraging" target set for the bank, which included selling off €10 billion of international loan assets, as well as being charged with the bank's management of NAMA loans. Its understood the decision not to appoint a senior manager to replace Mr Donovan reflects the fact that much of the unit's work has already been completed. Instead, the bank has appointed two senior managers as new members of the group executive committee, according to the memo.

'NO FIRMS HIT BY TAX CLAMPDOWN' - Not a single company has contacted the tax authorities to say they have been affected by changes announced in the budget as part of Finance Minister Michael Noonan's clampdown on international tax avoidance, reports the Irish Examiner. In October's budget, Mr Noonan included a measure that required any company incorporated in Ireland to be tax resident either in this country or another jurisdiction. Multinationals had been exploiting a loophole in the Irish tax system that enabled them to incorporate companies here that were not tax resident in any other state. In response to a parliamentary question from Michael McGrath, Fianna Fáil's finance spokesman, Mr Noonan said no companies had been affected by this change. "I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not, to date, been advised by any company that is or will be affected by the change in residence rules as to where it is actually resident following the announcement of the change in the budget," he said. Mr McGrath said he was "amazed" that not a single company had been hit by the rule change.

OSBORNE LOSES POUND AND FINDS THREEPENCE - George Osborne is to scrap the current £1 coin and replace it with a 12-sided version reminiscent of the old threepenny bit, in a Budget move that may appeal to the patriotism and nostalgia of a key section of the electorate. The chancellor took a personal interest in the design of the new coin, whose retro-look will incorporate anti-forgery features which Mr Osborne claims will make it the most secure coin in circulation in the world, says the Financial Times. In a Budget with little money for populist “giveaways”, Mr Osborne’s back-to-the-future coin may turn out to be one of the biggest talking points of his statement. Mr Osborne says the current £1 coin, which has been in circulation for over 30 years, is increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters so that about 3% of all the coins in circulation are fakes. In his role as Master of the Mint, Mr Osborne will announce plans for a replacement coin to be introduced in 2017, of bimetallic construction and of two colours, but crucially with 12 sides. Treasury officials admit the coin’s resemblance to the old threepenny bit has little to do with security and everything to do with nostalgia; the new design is a reincarnation of a coin that was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation 1971.###5768||Empty###5769||While Gov.

Walmart will allow for trade-ins to Walmart employees starting today, with official trade-ins to customers beginning on March 26th at over 3,100 stores. Then, in the Summer, Walmart will be reselling the used games in stores and online, calling them “Certified Pre-Owned”.

Walmart made sure to note that “new releases will still remain the focus of our business,” but when it comes to trading in games for a Walmart gift card (which can be used to buy anything in stores and online), their strategy is “to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want.” They also added, “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins.”

It's hard not to see this as having to do with the audio files Twitter users are passing around involving the prime minister and a corruption investigation.

ISTANBUL — Turkey has blocked Twitter hours after the prime minister vowed he’d “eradicate” the popular social media site.

A controversial new internet law passed last month allows the country’s telecommunications authority to order content removed within hours without a court order.

On Thursday night, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed Twitter wasn’t complying with the new law, and told a rally of thousands that he’d bring the site down.

The press advisory of the Prime Ministry later in the night clarified Erdogan's statement, arguing that Twitter officials currently "ignore" some court rulings in Turkey, which order the social media platform to "remove some links" as per the complaints filed by Turkish citizens.

"[In Erdogan's speech] it is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens," the statement said.

Reaction to the move — which came around midnight Friday local time — was swift. Major newspapers posted instructions offering simple technical workarounds to access the site.

“This is certainly a step backwards in terms of openness, transparency and the democratization process of Turkey,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Restrictions on political speech and discourse of this scale is unacceptable in any country including in Turkey.”

Twitter representatives confirmed reports that the site had been disrupted.

“We're looking into this now,” said Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler. The company’s official account offered Turkish cell phone subscribers ways to send tweets via text message.

The cause of the ban is most certainly political as Turkey prepares for March 30 local elections, seen as a key test of power for the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, now in its 11th year of rule.

Anonymous users have been posting links to YouTube of audio recordings purporting to be wiretaps that expose rampant corruption within Erdogan's inner circle.

This follows a corruption scandal that erupted Dec. 17 that implicated three cabinet ministers as well as businessmen with close ties to the prime minister’s closest associates.

The government has responded to the accusations with mass purges of the police and judiciary as well as by ordering evidence destroyed. Erdogan has said the accusations are part of a plot hatched by a former ideological ally, Fethullah Gulen — a Pennsylvania-based Islamic cleric — whom he accuses of conspiring to bring down his government.

“It was just a matter of moment for Prime Minister Erdogan and his men to decide to ban Twitter,” said Erkan Saka, an outspoken blogger and communications lecturer at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Twitter remains the main channel for freedom of expression and dissemination of corruption file leaks.”

Cyber law experts say the ban on Twitter is reminiscent of the YouTube ban that lasted for 18 months from 2008-2010.

“Certainly this is politically motivated just prior to the local elections,” Akdeniz said. “I suspect the decisions were issued prior to the PM's speech but they were only executed subsequent to his speech.”

Some of the alleged leaked wiretaps appeared to record Erdogan himself instructing media companies to censor coverage of last spring’s Gezi Park protests. Such censorship — during the protests CNN Türk famously showed a documentary on penguins in Antarctica in place of the news — is another reason why Twitter has been an important tool for Turkish citizens to share information, unrestricted, in real time. Several media companies during Erdogan’s tenure as prime minister have been fined or taken over by companies close to the government.

The recently passed internet law was panned by press freedom groups, including the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which warned it would have a chilling effect on free speech. The Turkish government claimed that the law was meant to protect children and the privacy of individuals.

Right now, the warnings from CPJ and other press freedom groups are looking prescient.

“CPJ urges the Turkish government to immediately unblock Twitter, and to respect the press freedom and free expression rights of its citizens,” said Geoffrey King, the group's internet advocacy coordinator, late Thursday.###5780||By Sneha Shankar - A combined review done by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, into the airplane maker's pioneering 787 Dreamliner, has concluded that its design and manufacture are sound.

According to the report released Wednesday, the FAA had ordered a review of the planes last year, after grounding the entire fleet following a series of problems with onboard batteries. The report said that some Boeing suppliers did not follow the right industry standards for quality control but added that “effective processes” had been put in place since then to correct the problem.

“The CSRT (Critical Systems Review Team) determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane’s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification,” the report said.

The report also concluded that the FAA should increase its supervision of foreign and "high-risk" subcontractor facilities and recommended that Boeing should ensure its suppliers "are fully aware of their responsibilities" and formulate a way to ensure that they "identify realistic program risk."

Although Illinois-based Boeing’s 787 is reportedly one of the most advanced planes in the market, it has been hit with a series of problems that have cast doubts on the plane’s airworthiness. Many of the company's customers, including Qatar Airways, Air India and LOT Polish Airlines have reported various problems with the plane.

Earlier this month, Boeing announced that it had found hairline cracks on the wings of some 787 jets under production after a Japanese supplier, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (TYO:7011), warned the airline manufacturer about it. Last July, a fire started aboard a 787 jet owned by Ethiopian Airlines while it was parked at London’s Heathrow Airport. In August, All Nippon Airways, or ANA, found faults in the battery wiring of locator transmitters on two of its Dreamliner airplanes, during checks. In another instance, a section of the fuselage of an Air India-owned Dreamliner was found missing on landing.

"The review team identified some problems with the manufacturing process and the way we oversee it, and we are moving quickly to address those problems," Michael P. Huerta, an FAA administrator, reportedly said in a statement, according to The Wall Street Journal.

“Boeing has mitigated issues related to aircraft assembly and manufacturing using proprietary processes and its QMS. Overall, the subteam noted continued improvement in all areas, as evidenced by the reduced number of interventions, negligible changes to the current processes, and higher quality of output coupled with an increased B787 production rate,” the FAA report said.###5781||Empty###5782||If water managers wielded a divining rod, the forked end would not point toward the heavens nor the Sierra Nevada. It would bend toward a major water source hundreds of feet beneath the Earth”s crust.

Indeed, with zero percent allocation from the State Water Project and a state mired in the third year of drought, even recent rainstorms can”t bring the familiar sources — aqueducts carrying water from Northern California — back to normal.

Instead, managers must find salvation in vast, underground lakes holding billions of gallons of fresh water stretching from the San Fernando to the San Gabriel Valley, from Southeast L.A. County to the West Basin and the Santa Ana River into the Inland Empire.

Once the man-made reservoirs run low — say by this time next year — water managers will depend on their last resort, the basins.

In short, water managers say they have enough supplies to get us through a third year of drought and a dusty summer without pressing the crisis button. But “Drought 2015” will become a game of aquifers and attitudes.

For example, jumping ahead a year, the city of Los Angeles may be in the worst shape.

Thirty years ago, Los Angeles received 70 percent of its water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct and 15 percent from both ground water aquifers and imported water purchased from Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Today, the numbers have changed dramatically to 40 percent from the L.A. Aqueduct, 10 percent from ground water and 50 percent from MWD, said Marty Adams, head of water operations at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Relying more and more on state water imported from Northern California is not a secure formula. This year, the agency celebrated the 100th anniversary of the L.A. Aqueduct. Hidden amid the fanfare was this statistic: the lowest amount of water came down the concrete channel in its history, Adams said.

In its heydey, the L.A. Aqueduct, which once turned Mono Lake into a salt flat, yielded 460,000 acre-feet of water. This year, it yielded 60,000 acre-feet, he said. An acre-foot of water is one acre of land covered in water 1 foot deep or about enough water for two families for a year.

In 2015, the LADWP will be forced to buy between 70 percent and 75 percent of its supplies from MWD, Adams said. The MWD reserves — stored since 2009, the year the last drought ended — are available at near 100 percent capacity at Pyramid Lake, Castaic Lake and Diamond Valley Lake in Hemet.

The only problem may be getting that water to the people in the San Fernando Valley, Adams said. “Their (MWD”s) biggest pool of water is not physically accessible to the San Fernando Valley but we can shift. We can make it work,” he said.

One of the angles is to clean up the ground water basin in the Valley, buy supplemental water from MWD, blend it with the aqueduct water and deliver it to customers. LADWP can also buy water from East Los Angeles that originated in the Colorado River and pump it through an underground pipeline beneath the Santa Monica Mountains to the west San Fernando Valley, he said.

Of course, Adams is concerned about using up all the reserves.

“Metropolitan has said they have enough storage for this year. The question is, how much do we use from those reservoirs? You want to use them very judiciously,” Adams said.

The biggest losers will be farmers that do not have contracts for water from the State Water Project or the federal Central Valley Project. Both have decided not to release water to any users not signed up. Also, allocations will be drastically reduced.

“I can”t impress enough how serious the situation is, particularly for agriculture in the state,” said Shane Chapman, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a wholesale water agency whose district includes about 1 million people.

About 1.5 million acres of land could be fallowed in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, he said. Farmers will not plant some crops in order to maximize high-profit crops, such as almonds and pistachios, he said.

The recent torrential rainstorms dumped 4 inches in downtown Los Angeles and brought the season total to 5.72 inches, about 49 percent of the average, said Bill Patzert, meteorologist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge.

“We are still 50 percent down. It is still a dry year,” he said

Rainfall in the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains was higher, but the runoff didn”t reach the underground aquifers.

“It didn”t help the drought at all. It is like trying to catch water in a champagne glass when someone is shooting a firehose at you. Most of it ends up in the ocean,” he said.

Adams would rather see the snow build up in Mammoth and the Eastern Sierra. But it will take close to 40 feet of snow there to return water supplies to normal, he said.

The Los Angeles County Flood Control District experts say they”ve been able to capture 100 percent of the water from the San Gabriel River during a normal year. That”s because the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers are mostly soft-bottomed, meaning they allow water to seep into the ground. Most of the L.A. River is concrete and impervious.

Water is captured in spreading grounds — areas of rock and gravel and berms — that like a sponge soak water into the underground aquifer. The most important aspect, aside from protecting homes from floods, is recharging the ground water, said Adam Walden, senior engineer with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works.

Unfortunately, Southern California”s basins are over pumped and abused. San Gabriel and San Fernando are peppered with contamination from years of dumping by the aerospace industry going back to the 1950s, rendering some wells inoperative.

“Ground water … is a diminishing resource as it is being pumped at rates that exceed current rates of natural recharge, leading to challenges related to saltwater intrusion, basin salinity, and increased need for imported water,” according to the Council for Watershed Health”s report on the Central and West basins.###5783||Empty###5784||Empty###5785||Empty###5786||Empty###5787||BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- After more than a year of planning and intense media curiosity, the Walmart to Go convenience store "quietly" opened in Bentonville, Ark., on March 15, with the grand opening set for March 19, reported The City Wire. It is Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s new effort to capture a different and growing element of the retail market.

The newspaper described the small store is a "hybrid format--part traditional convenience store, part grocery, part quick-serve restaurant." The site also features six canopied gasoline dispensers.

Walmart partnered with Bentonville Butcher & Deli to operate a deli counter in the back of the store. There are soda and frozen drink fountains, milk shakes and full coffee bar.

Refrigerated food-to-go includes market fresh pizzas, sandwiches and other meat entrees. There is also fresh fruit and a Greek yogurt smoothie station.

The store offers beer and wine in a walk-in cooler, as well as frozen food.

The small grocery component includes five aisles with hundreds of packaged foods and nonfood items from breakfast cereals to dog food and diapers. Shirley's Flowers has a fresh flowers kiosk near the front doors next to the Hallmark Cards. The store also has Krispy Kreme doughnuts, magazines, books and an ATM, as well as interior and exterior seating areas.

The center of the store closely resembles a traditional c-store with cashiers in a corral with a wide range of tobacco products.

The retailer is testing an online grocery delivery service with a similar name, WalmartToGo.com, said a report by Arkansas Business. Wal-Mart spokesperson Deisha Barnett told the newspaper that the Walmart to Go c-store is a "one-off project."

"It's a convenience store test concept," she said. "We're not planning any more across the country."

Walmart currently operates 20 small-format Walmart Express stores, approximately 15,000 square feet in size. The units have performed well, it said, and the company is expanding them beyond the initial three-market pilot. The company also is testing several 2,500-square-foot, college-based convenience store-type retail outlets called Walmart on Campus.

Bill Simon, Walmart U.S. president and CEO recently said that its "small-store expansion … including fresh, pharmacy and fuel, will help us usher in the next generation of retail." In what industry observers have pegged as a strategy to quell competition from the dollar-store channel, Wal-Mart has announced that it is significantly accelerating its capital plan for U.S. small-store format openings for the current fiscal year.

Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores has 10,942 stores under 71 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 10 countries, with fiscal-year 2014 sales of more than $473 billion.###5788||10.17.18 in Gadgetry

Starting next week, Walmart shoppers looking for something to do with those Batman: Arkham Origins discs they no longer play will have one more option for unloading their used video games, as the nation’s largest retailer aims to likely become the largest purchaser of customers’ old games.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Walmart will soon start buying used video games from shoppers at 3,100 locations. Of course, this being Walmart, you don’t get cash your old game, you get a Walmart gift card. The value of that card will be tied to the value of the game in question.

Unlike some major retailers who have trade-in programs but don’t directly resell used games back to its shoppers, Walmart will reportedly be selling these old titles at its stores; and the company says it will soon be doing so at lower prices than people pay for used games elsewhere.

For Walmart, it’s a way to get a slice of the still-lucrative, $2 billion/year used game market at a time when an increasing number of game-buyers are getting their new games digitally, thus bypassing retailers like Walmart and Best Buy. Walmart also sees it as a way to let customers cash in on games they aren’t playing — and then spend that “found” money at Walmart.

One might assume that GameStop — until now, the retail market leader in used game sales — would be shaking in its boots at the notion of Walmart stomping on its business.

“We win those market share battles because we’ve been at it a long time,” CEO Paul Raines tells the Journal, presumably while flipping through the help-wanted ads.

Walmart hopes that shoppers will choose it over existing competitors because you can’t trade in a copy of Borderlands 2 for a head of lettuce or a pair of sweatpants at GameStop.

Raines cautioned that big retailers might not understand the logistical nightmare they face when jumping into the used game business, saying, “there are lots and lots of risks when you’re buying a preowned product.”###5790||"We had heard the concerns raised in the letter and had reached out to a number of members of Congress prior to this letter to address those concerns," said Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller.

Business News###5793||Empty###5794||Istanbul: Turkey on Friday blocked access to Twitter nine days before local elections, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan acted on his vow to shut down leaks targeting his government amid a corruption probe.

The move was criticised both within Turkey and overseas, as users accessed Twitter via proxies and other work-arounds. President Abdullah Gul was one of them, posting to his Twitter account that the total ban of a social media platform "can't be condoned" and that he hoped it wouldn't last.

"Twitter, mwitter!" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Credit:Getty Images

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called Erdogan's ban a "groundless, pointless, cowardly" act of censorship. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the premier is "waging a campaign against all the media and press that he cannot directly influence or control."

The shutdown began hours after Erdogan said San Francisco-based Twitter had ignored court orders to remove content related to the graft investigation. He's also threatened to block Facebook and YouTube, where users have shared material including videos, recordings and transcripts that were first leaked via Twitter. Some of them are tied to a police investigation of government corruption which has cost four cabinet ministers their jobs and roiled markets.

It has been estimated that there are 10 million Twitter users in Turkey.###5795||The United States and the European Union are imposing targeted economic sanctions -- and threatening even broader measures -- against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. RFE/RL takes a look at some basics of the art of sanctioning.



Who has the authority to impose sanctions?



Russia insists that unilateral sanctions violate international law.



"Unilateral sanctions have never brought about anything good. They are illegitimate and have no international legal basis," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on March 20 to the Russian Duma.



"The [UN] Security Council is the only body that can make decisions about coercive measures toward sovereign states. No such decision has been made by it regarding the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian leadership represented by [ousted Ukrainian] President [Viktor] Yanukovych."



At the same time, Russia has repeatedly imposed trade barriers and restrictions on many countries, particularly ones like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia that have pursued aggressive European-integration policies.



What role does the World Trade Organization (WTO) play?



Russia joined the WTO in 2012, and the United States and all EU member states are also members. The EU itself is also a member of the WTO.



Although the WTO is intended to facilitate international trade, its rules, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), include provisions that enable countries to establish trade restrictions for "national security reasons."



"Under Article 21 of the GATT, there is an exception for national-security reasons. This is generally been interpreted as the provision under which any economic sanctions would fall," says Stephen Woolcock, an associate professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.



Russia could, however, challenge any sanctions through WTO dispute-settlement mechanisms. And, theoretically, the WTO could overturn sanctions that were determined to be in violation of GATT rules.



Such a turn of events is considered highly unlikely as long as sanctions remain at the level of targeted measures against individuals. If the West moves to broader sanctions aimed at the Russian economy, which U.S. President Barack Obama has said could happen, Russia might have more grounds to seek redress.



But Woolcock notes that sanctions have been imposed against WTO members in the past and none has been successfully challenged within the organization.



The WTO has no mechanism for sanctioning members or expelling them. Some countries have left of their own accord, however.



Some analysts have argued that the WTO could also be used to punish Moscow, as members could file complaints against Russia for some of its controversial trade practices. In July, for instance, the EU announced it would challenge a Russian law that imposes a fee on foreign car producers for scrapping used vehicles in Russia.



Do the sanctions extend to the family members of targeted individuals?



Not automatically, says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the London-based Center for European Reform and a veteran British diplomat. "They won't automatically extend to relatives, but they will, for example, extend to shell companies where the EU or the U.S. can identify that the controlling interest is held by a person who is subject to sanctions," he says.



It has been reported, for instance, that Russian oil trader Gennady Timchenko sold his stake in Swiss-based Gunvor to his business partner on the eve of the announcement of sanctions against him. Bond says financial authorities will certainly investigate that alleged sale and could rule that Timchenko continues to benefit from Gunvor's assets.



If EU or U.S. financial authorities can prove that a relative is merely holding assets that benefit a sanctioned individual, those assets could also be targeted.



Expanding the targeted sanctions to family members could be done as an additional measure of targeted sanctions before the West moves to broader sanctions against the Russian economy.



Why hasn't Russian President Vladimir Putin been sanctioned?



Sanctions against a sitting head of state are extremely rare and are generally reserved only for rulers that Western countries would like to see removed, such as Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe or the former ruling military junta in Burma.



Ian Bond says doing so is the "nuclear option" of targeted sanctions. "And I guess that everybody is trying not to go for steps that are really at the top of the list of things that could be done," he adds. "There is still a lot more that could go wrong, a lot more ways in which Russia could interfere in Ukraine and make the situation worse."



What about possible sanctions against Russian state journalists and publicists such as Sergei Markov or Aleksandr Dugin, who have been actively justifying Russia's intervention in Ukraine?



Bond says sanctions could be imposed upon such people if the West determines they are actively promoting violence or disseminating hate speech. It is, however, an issue on which Europe and the United States might not be able to agree.



"I realize that is very difficult territory particularly for the U.S. because of its very strong attachment to the First Amendment" of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech," Bond says. "It is in some ways less of an issue for Europeans because certainly in countries like Germany, for very good historical reasons, they have pretty strong laws on how far you are allowed to go."



The latest round of EU sanctions includes Dmitry Kiselyov, the head of the Russian state news agency Rossia Segodnya. The EU document describes Kiselyov as a "central figure of the government propaganda machine supporting the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine."

Gul himself used Twitter to express criticism, by posting on his account that "shutdown was unacceptable".

On Thursday evening, Erdogan vowed to close the social network, through which a series of wiretapped conversation allegedly proving corruption in the cabinet have reached Turkish society.

Erdogan claimed that "everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic" and he did not care "what the international community says at all," as the BBC quoted him as saying. Hurriyet Daily News also reveals he expressed readiness to "eradicate" the micro-blogging platform.

Later on, Prime Minister's spokesman said the measure had been taken after the social media had failed to respond to a court ruling to remove links from the platform.

On Friday morning, millions of Twitter users reported they were unable to into their accounts, even though the ban later proved to be futile as many ways could be found to circumvent it.

In response President Gul, who had previously approved a controversial Internet bill allowing for the closure of websites by the Turkish Telecommunications Authority, said Friday that sites should be blocked if courts found that they had violated personal privacy. He also said he hoped the ban would not last long.

Earlier he also turned on Erdogan when the latter suggested he might crack down on social media to put an end to what he considers a plot against the government led by his rival Fethullah Gulen.

The EU expressed criticism at Turkey's move to shut down Twitter, with EU enlargement commissioner Stefan Fuele saying he was "gravely concerned." European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes even described the move as "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

Twitter did not immediately comment on the issue, but announced later it had hired a lawyer to negotiate with the Turkish Telecommunications Authority and discuss a possible legal solution.

Some Turkish ministers tried meanwhile to justify the move, with Forestry Minister Veysel Eroglu quoted by Hurriyet Daily as saying that blocking Twitter would ensure a more peaceful election and will prevent the spreading of "sensational and deceitful news".###5801||* Short-term safe-haven bids for yen unwind

* United States, EU impose sanctions on Russia

* Euro firm despite Russia crisis, seen as safe haven

By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Michael Connor

NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors saw as modest economic sanctions against Russia and Ukraine following Crimea’s weekend vote to join Moscow.

The dollar, often a shelter for investors against global stresses, was also down, with the dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, off 0.13 percent to 79.345 in afternoon trading.

“The market thinks, it’s not so bad,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets Online Trading in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. “You don’t see any signs of play against the euro. If the sanctions were serious, say against Russia’s oil and gas exports, you’d see selling of the euro because they don’t have much alternative for energy.”

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion in major markets. The absence of military conflict between the two countries also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia’s military incursion into Crimea. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, will impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday.

“The sanctions don’t sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In late New York trading, the dollar was up 0.3 percent against the yen at 101.66 yen, rising after four days of losses driven by investors buying the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.5 percent to 141.51 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.392, despite data showing a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe’s common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro’s strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn’t weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.2 percent versus the franc at 1.2159.###5802||Warning - there was an unexpected script error. Application may not work as expected.###5803||Empty###5804||It was handbags at dawn yesterday and the bloodied loser was Mulberry boss Bruno Guillon, who paid with his job for meddling with middle England's favourite handbag-maker.

The Somerset firm announced Guillon's departure with "immediate effect" after the firm's attempt to chase the spending power of high end shoppers on New York's Fifth Avenue and Hong Kong's Causeway Bay alienated the John Lewis crowd back home – who were its most loyal shoppers, even if they had to save up for months to buy one of its soft leather bags.

In a terse statement to the stock exchange, the company's chairman Godfrey Davis said he was returning to lead the business and thanked the Frenchman for his hard work.

That "hard work" included engineering a slump in sales and profits that has seen the company's stock market value crash from £1.5bn to just £400m.

His two year reign also saw the departure of Emma Hill, the creative genius who was credited with bringing about the brand's renaissance in the first place, with bestselling designs such as the Alexa – a satchel named after presenter Alexa Chung – and the Del Rey, dedicated to singer Lana Del Rey.

It has been reported that Hill, who had previously worked for Burberry and Marc Jacobs, did not agree with Mulberry's push upmarket and her important position remains vacant.

Davis politely insisted that Guillon, who joined from Hermès in 2012, had improved the quality of the Mulberry offering and increased its appeal in overseas markets. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he said.

Four years ago, when Davis was still running Mulberry, he told the Guardian it was a "grave mistake for luxury brands to think all their customers are super-rich". He drilled into staff the importance of being friendly to customers and the firm's internal mantra "we don't believe in bad manners, fashion egos or size zeros" was an antidote to austere Bond Street boutiques.

Back then, Mulberry's classic Bays-water bag, costing £500, was within touching distance for many British women. Today, after Guillon introduced more exotic finishes such as ostrich skin, they start at around £900. Its smallest bag – a clutch style wallet measuring 11cm by 20cm – costs £495, while keyrings run to £100.

Having watched Burberry's success over the last decade, Guillon was eyeing the $390bn global market for designer clothes and accessories, where well-heeled shoppers do not bat an eyelid at a four- or five-figure price tag. Recent initiatives include a collaboration with model Cara Delevingne unveiled at London fashion week and included a bag inspired by her lion tattoo.

But with more than 60% of Mulberry's sales rung up in the UK, its traditional shoppers were priced out of the market and have since defected to fast-growing brands such as Michael Kors and Coach whose arm candy are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals.

When Guillon took over in 2012 Mulberry could do no wrong for shoppers or investors. It was the sleeper success of the luxury goods sector, having quietly metamorphosed from a staid brand, adopted by the green welly brigade in the 1980s, into a fun and unpredictable label capable of conjuring up "it-bags" that "it-girls" such as Chung were happy to sling over their shoulders. Like many brands it owes a debt to Kate Moss, a friend of Hill's, who lit a fuse in the fashion press when she stepped out with a Bayswater in the crook of her arm a decade ago. Moss's patronage proved a turning point for the brand, putting it on the radar of Grazia readers.

Lorna Hall, head of retail at trend consultancy WGSN, said it can be very hard for fashion brands to move upmarket and even more so in the glare of the stock market where executives are forced to publish regular sales updates. "When you make this kind of shift there is always a danger of alienating your existing customers," she said. "Mulberry has made a big shift in its prices.

Antivirus and security software heavyweight Symantec certainly caught the market off-guard yesterday (20th March). The company’s shares are feeling the heat today – down around 13% at time of writing.

The US-based company announced the termination of Steve Bennett as President and CEO.

At the same time, Symantec reiterated its fourth quarter revenue and profit guidance: it expects revenue of between $1.62bn and $1.66bn (versus $1.75bn the previous year).

Still, the move to fire Mr Bennett has created something of a stir given that he was just 20 months into the job of trying to restore the company to growth.

Competition is fierce

Prevalent cyber-attacks and security breaches and the resulting sustained emphasis on the need for security means that the market is seen as growing.

So it’s no surprise that competition is fierce among both existing players and relatively new entrants as they grapple to gain a larger share of the growing security market. Following underperformance, and in a bid to reposition competitively, Symantec embarked on a transformation plan, which included developing new competitive products and cutting costs.

But, over the last few quarters, declining sales and a plummeting share price (down some 32% from highs reached last summer) have plagued the company.

In light of Symantec’s recent performance, it’s perhaps fair to say that, despite turnaround efforts, the journey towards renewed growth seemed a tad protracted under Mr Bennett’s helm.

That said, given that the Norton antivirus maker sports a net cash position of around $1.8bn (as at December last year), it does have some financial flexibility to embark on further investments as it continues pursuing a turn around.

But shareholders’ patience might be running out…

According to the company’s interim CEO, Michael Brown, “the need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market”.

Indeed, that’s true but it was also just as true some two years ago.

The sell-off on the back this latest news might arguably be a tad dramatic but – until such a time as the company is seen by the market as executing its turnaround effectively (near-term’s doubtful) – the widespread downbeat sentiment is unlikely to improve significantly.###5807||The domain woi-tv.com maybe for sale.

Of course, if we receive an official Walmart response, I'll include that as well.



"Your reporting about Wal-Mart deserves wide distribution. Shareholders should be in open revolt about this train wreck of an organization." --Reader Email

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- As I have noted in recent days, the response to my recent Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stories has been nothing short of overwhelming.

It all started with 24 Pictures From a Walmart Store That Make Sears Look Classy.

A considerable portion of it comes from readers who work at Walmart. Many of the emails I have received from Walmart employees, independent of one another, corroborate one another. I'll publish a representative sampling in this article.

Of course, I keep identities anonymous if that was what was requested. In other cases, I mention specific stores but do not include details that would out specific individuals.

I have repeatedly asked Walmart for comment and have received no response.

The responses I received from readers indicates a systemic problem at Walmart -- one created by folks at the corporate level, not on the ground, in retail stores. In fact, given the position Walmart appears to have put many of its retail workers in, it's amazing enough of them can keep it together well enough to keep the business running. Without considerable intervention, this can't possibly end well. In fact, I really believe we're watching a failure unfold in front of our eyes. But it's one we're watching spring from the ground up, even though the people on the ground should not be held culpable.

If Walmart doesn't act fast to right the ship, disgruntled employees and dirty stores might become more than a minor irritation. They could further damage the business and, in turn, the company's stock price.

First, consider the following (lightly edited, bold emphasis added) email from a Walmart employee, who will remain completely anonymous:

Regarding your photos of Wal-Mart article, when I read it I just had to laugh. I work at a Wal-Mart and I can tell you with no uncertainty that the single reason for all of the problems in those photos is understaffing. This is not a store by store problem, either; it is a corporate problem. Corporate decides how many hours we are allowed to schedule employees with each week and how many employees we are allowed to hire, and it usually falls short of what we, the employees, feel we need.

For instance, resets used to be done by a 3rd shift team, but they were a small team and could only ever get grocery resets done, so we in the general merchandise area had to do our own during the day. It's irrelevant now, as the reset team has since been eliminated.

I address the excuse that the mess I photo-illustrated at the South LA Walmart exists because of "resets" (wholesale reshaping/restocking of large sections of a store) in Monday's Walmart: Retail's Biggest Embarrassment.

The emailer continues by outlining what happens on the ground as a result of this understaffing:

Every week for the last 5 years, and every DAY for the last 2-3 months, 1st and 2nd shift employees at our store have been responsible for stocking freight from the previous day's trucks because we don't have enough 3rd shift stockers to accomplish this. That means every single day we have pallets on the floor in almost every general merchandise department, with associates -- who are supposed to be focused on other things like helping customers -- stocking shelves. With so much time dedicated to stocking, we have little time left to put away carts of junk or clean up aisles (as seen in your photos). If we try to do our real job duties instead, we get yelled at by management for not dealing with the freight. Most days the backup of freight in the back room is so bad we literally can't move back there, which means if a customer wants something that's back there, they aren't getting it.

The emailer closes with this:

You are right to say executives should be embarrassed of all this.

Another emailer corroborates the original emailer's statement regarding "resets" with the following correspondence:

But we're open to other alternatives."###5811||The USS Elrod has taken over escort duties from the USS Stout for the hijacked oil tanker Morning Glory, the Defense Department said Friday.

Army Col. Steven Warren said the Elrod assumed escort duties Wednesday, two days after a team of U.S. Navy SEALS seized control of the commercial tanker from three armed Libyan hijackers.

The escort change was for administrative reasons: The Stout is assigned to the U.S. European Command area, and the Elrod is assigned to U.S. Africa Command, Warren said.

About 25 members of the Stout's crew who had been aboard the Morning Glory to provide security, navigation and communications assistance have been replaced by about 34 sailors from the Elrod, according to Warren. The Elrod and Morning Glory are expected to reach international waters just outside Libya this weekend, where the Morning Glory will be turned over to Libyan authorities, Warren said.

The Morning Glory, hijacked from the port of As-Sidra, is carrying oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. Libya and Cyprus had requested assistance from the U.S. government in regaining control of the ship. The SEALS embarked from the USS Roosevelt, which is deployed in the Mediterranean as part of the George H.W. Bush carrier strike group.

No one was hurt in the SEAL operation, Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a news release earlier this week.

Gamers, get your game face up! Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.

The company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.

Net income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.

"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.

The trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. "Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Mac Naughton also said.

CE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.

A report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.

There are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.

Wal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with "certified pre-owned" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.

TPG Capital, a private-equity firm based in both Texas and California, is expected to be the dominant investor. The round of fundraising could reach $500 million. Dropbox and Chinese cell-phone manufacturer Xiaomi were the biggest of the 21 companies that raised new funds in the last year that pegged their valuation at $1 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported. The value for Airbnb has grown four-fold in a two-year period.

As of November, New York state’s top 40 Airbnb hosts each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a total of $35 million over that time. In that same period, the top 100 hosts grossed $54 million, as previously reported.

Also last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed data from Airbnb as part of a probe into the website’s compliance with a 2011 law, which makes it illegal to rent out an apartments for less than 30 days unless the owner or renter is also present in the home.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – In the coming months you may be able to trade in your used video games at your local Walmart.

For the first time, the world’s largest retailer will be accepting thousands of video games at their brick and mortar stores in exchange for store credit which can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade in programs. Walmart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones. Credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

The EU commissioner on digital affairs, Neelie Kroes, tweeted on Thursday (20 March) that the move “is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl [international] community will see this as censorship. It is.”

Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, himself a prolific user of the US micro-blogging site, noted: “Erdogan is not only damaging himself, but his entire nation.”

The EU’s former ambassador to Turkey, Marc Pierini, now an analyst at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels, said: “Turkey is estranging itself from the world.”

The ban entered into force shortly before midnight on Thursday.

It came just a few hours after Erdogan at a party rally in Bursa, near Istanbul, ahead of local elections on 30 March, said: “We now have a court order. We will dig up Twitter and so on - all of them - by the roots… I don't care what the international community says. They will see the Turkish republic's strength.”

His press service later noted: “It is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens.”

The “court rulings” refer to a Twitter account called Haramzadeler, meaning “son of thieves” in Turkish, which has been publishing leaked documents on alleged corruption in Erdogan’s inner circle.

The Haramzadeler leaks are part of wider anti-Erdogan exposures which began late last year, when he fell out with Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic teacher living in the US, over education reforms.

A Turkish official told Reuters “at the moment there is no [similar] decision for other social media like Facebook.”

The Twitter ban comes after Turkey in February passed a new law giving authorities the right to block access to websites if they are seen as having "insulting” content.

It also comes after Erdogan established political control over judicial appointments and fired hundreds of policemen and prosecutors looking into the corruption affair.

Even before the new measures, Turkey already ranked among the lowest of the low in terms of free speech.

It arrested more government-critical journalists than China or Iran last year, while the Twitter ban puts it in the company of China, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, and Pakistan.

Some MEPs have said accession talks, revived last year after a long gap, should once again be put on hold, while some EU officials, in private conversations, have likened Erdogan to Europe’s Communist-era autocrats.

Amid mounting, and at times deadly, clashes between young anti-government protesters and Erdogan’s police, the Twitter ban also risks backfiring inside Turkey, which has more than 12 million Twitter users.

Twitter itself noted that users can get round the ban by posting tweets via SMS-es from their mobile phones.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey trended to the top of worldwide postings on the site late on Thursday and early on Friday, with the majority of the #TwitterisblockedinTurkey posts coming from inside Turkey despite the restriction.

“Closing barn door after cow fled,” Ken Roth, the head of the New-York-based NGO, Human Rights Watch, said.###5816||Empty###5817||First Alert Weather: Cold front on the way

Today the UK Royal Mint has unveiled the new £1 coin that has been in development for some time and now includes new security features such as a bi-metalic construction and a 12 sided two colour design.

The new £1 coin also includes the Royal Mint’s new iSIS technology, or Integrated Secure Identification System. The iSIS technology comprises of three tiers of banknote-strength security enabling the coin to be authenticated using high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle reducing the likelihood of forgeries slipping into the cash system.

A public design competition for the new £1 coin will be held at a later date to choose the design for the reverse, or ‘tails’, of the coin. The new £1 coin is expected to be introduced in 2017.

“The new £1 coin also pays a fitting tribute to Britain’s heritage. It is the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny bit, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971.

The threepenny bit was in the first group of coins ever to feature the portrait of HRH Queen Elizabeth II.

The new version coined in 1953 bore a design of a Tudor chained portcullis, which was inherited by the 1p piece after decimalisation and remains on the coin today, as well as being the badge of the Palace of Westminster.

The threepenny bit was the first British coin to use a 12-sided shape which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War, as its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during the blackout.

By the time of decimalisation 1.2 billion had been issued for circulation.”

Bond prices crept steadily higher as the day progressed before moving roughly sideways going into the close. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.5 basis points to 2.75 percent.

The modest move to the upside by treasuries partly reflected easing concerns about the outlook for interest rates.

While worries that the Federal Reserve could raise rates sooner than anticipated contributed to a sharp drop by treasuries on Wednesday, traders seemed to realize that the guidance was not all the surprising.

In her post-meeting press conference, new Fed Chair Janet Yellen seemed to suggest that the central bank could begin raising rates by mid-2015.

The comments initially triggered fears across the , although analysts later noted that many economists have been offering the same forecast.

Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota released a statement this morning explaining his dissenting vote at the Fed meeting.

Kocherlakota said he wanted the Fed's statement to include language indicating that the central bank would keep rates at near-zero levels at least until the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent.

On Thursday, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected increase by its index of leading economic indicators, while a separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a significant turnaround in regional manufacturing activity.

Market Analysis###5821||The board of directors is looking for someone with more security prowess.

In the week of Symantec’s firing of CEO Steve Bennett, a leading analyst familiar with the security firm has suggested he lacked the technical expertise for the role.

Bennett, who became CEO less than two years ago, was replaced by board member Michael Brown on an interim basis as the antivirus maker suffered from declining revenue and slumping shares.

A statement released by Symantec said that the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety".

However, Gene Ruth, the leading analyst of Symantec at Gartner, told CBR: "He was not a technical person and it’s possible that the board of directors were looking for someone that has more technical vision and prowess in that area.

"So my guess would be that now that the organisation has been set up and the implementations are underway now, what they need is a technically oriented person who can set the vision for the company, so I’d be looking for someone to come out of a high tech area to fill Steve shoes."

He added: "I sat down with him four days after he took the job and a couple of times after that. He’s a measured type of person, and he seemed quite interested and level-headed… and he knows how to build teams and get productivity out of teams."

The firm reported in January a 5% decline in revenue for the third quarter ending December 27, which Bennett blamed on changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.###5822||Empty###5823||After two days of gains that have taken U.S. stocks right back to within sneezing distance of their all-time highs, one might expect the market to remain in a holding pattern until the outcome of the Fed's monetary policy meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release its statement at 2 p.m. EDT, followed by Janet Yellen's first press conference as Fed chairwoman. The benchmark S&P 500 and the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) were up 0.01% and 0.09%, respectively, as of 10:20 a.m. EDT. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will be on investors' radar this morning after releasing disappointing fiscal second-quarter results yesterday afternoon -- shares are down 3% this morning.

The enterprise software giant missed Wall Street's expectations for adjusted earnings per share, revenue, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- a crude measure of cash flow). On EPS, this constitutes Oracle's third miss in the past five quarters; on revenue, it's four misses in five quarters; and on EBITDA, it's five misses in five quarters. But look at the magnitude of the latest misses: its largest, for EPS, was less than 3%; on revenue, the miss was less than half a percentage point.

There were more positive aspects to the results, too. Notably, revenue from hardware systems products rose 8% to $725 million -- the first such increase since Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 (although it's not clear that this is enough to justify the $5.6 billion purchase price). The growth in hardware revenue relates to the 30% growth (on a constant currency basis) in the engineered server systems business, which was one of the highlights of the quarter. As Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement:

Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have to.

Cloud software subscription revenue grew 25% in the quarter, with quarterly cloud application revenue now approaching $300 million. Large enterprise software vendors, including IBM and Microsoft, are now offering their products in the cloud -- software running on hosted hardware -- as corporate IT buyers shift toward this lower-maintenance format.

Oracle suffers from the curse of size, both in terms of its ability to be nimble and to grow its revenue base. Nevertheless, I continue to think the company is well positioned to serve its corporate customers. No one is reasonably expecting Oracle to generate massive growth at this stage, but at less than 12.5 times next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate, one can expect the shares to produce reasonable returns going forward, with good odds of outperforming the broad market.###5824||Empty###5825||Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Reynolds tries to access the site

Twitter users in Turkey report that the social media site has been blocked in the country.

Some users trying to open the twitter.com website are apparently being redirected to a statement by Turkey's telecommunications regulator.

It cites a court order to apply "protection measures" on the website.

This comes after PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "wipe out Twitter" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle.

The BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul reports that he is unable to access Twitter.

"I don't care what the international community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic," Mr Erdogan said earlier on Thursday.

He spoke after some users had posted documents reportedly showing evidence of corruption relating to the prime minister - a claim he denies.

His office said that Twitter had not responded to Turkey's court rulings to remove some links, forcing Ankara to act.

Twitter has so far made no public comment on the issue.

There are about 10m Twitter users across Turkey.

In-depth analysis News Writer Brandan Blevins reports that experts say Symantec's strategic problems root deeper than just its CEO.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based security vendor has appointed Michael Brown, a member of its board of directors, as its interim president and CEO. Bennett also stepped down from Symantec's board of directors.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future," said Symantec board chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement.

In searching for its next CEO, Schulman said the company's priority is to identify a leader who can leverage Symantec's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.

Bennett assumed the top job at Symantec in July 2012, shortly after the company's board removed its previous CEO, Enrique Salem.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process," said Schulman, "and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Just last week in an interview with CRN, Bennett detailed his plans for growing Big Yellow's market share in key information security product segments, emphasizing the so-called "Symantec 4.0" strategy that included new road maps for its information security, information management and mobility product lines.

However, many have questioned Symantec's strategy in recent years as enterprises have shifted away from endpoint security products, Symantec's core market, instead favoring a mix of emerging network security products.

The company is also facing a Justice Department investigation regarding whether its sales practices violated the U.S. False Claims Act. Symantec said efforts related to the investigation are likely to cost the company close to $150 million.

Symantec said it is convening a special committee of its board of directors to begin an immediate search for a permanent CEO, with assistance from an executive search firm.###5827||Today, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) announced that it is going to try to bury GameStop's (NYSE:GME) still-warm corpse by accepting used video games for trade-in. GameStop's unique selling point has always been the fact that it is the one big chain where you can go and trade in games, so does this mean that we're watching the end of an era? Probably not.

As it turns out, a handful of big chains have already tried to get in on the used-game market. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been accepting games for years now, and they've taken very little from GameStop. Analysts have said that they "do not believe Wal-Mart will have a material impact on GameStop's dominant used video game market share" and that "[history] suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share." In classic market style, GameStop's stock fell 5% on the news.

Why GameStop can hold it down

There are two main reasons that GameStop has been able to defend its moat. First, the company is, ostensibly, staffed with video game fans. When video gamers are looking for someone to talk to, they head to GameStop, where the in-depth discussion never ends. Just kidding: No one talks to employees anymore. What do you think this is, 1950?

The real reason GameStop can hold off Best Buy is that it generally has a bigger selection of games, and the value you get for trading in doesn't fluctuate enough between the two to drive business to Best Buy. If you're going to get the same amount for your game but you've got a broader selection of things to buy at GameStop, you're probably going to go there.

Wal-Mart is likely going to face the same headwinds as Amazon has. Amazon -- a company that competes on price for everything else -- has done, at best, a mediocre job of paying players for used games. Wal-Mart's plan is to take used games for store credit, without selling used games until they build up a collection. So for the first few months, you can walk in, leave your game, get some Wal-Mart credit -- the company won't give cash for games -- and then come back in a few months to buy a different used game.

GameStop isn't out of the woods

Just because Wal-Mart isn't going to crush GameStop doesn't mean that GameStop is fine. The company is still grappling with the increase in digital sales and the fact that the future is going to be all digital. While that time is still a ways off, GameStop needs to have a plan in place ahead of time. The good news is, if you believe that GameStop will get its act together -- I'm still on the fence -- today's fall would offer you a nice discount to get into GameStop. On the other hand, if you think it's all on its way to pear-shaped, maybe now is the time to cash out on those old Sonic games.###5828||Iowa’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January edged up to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent in December

Vladimir Putin yesterday mocked the West's sanctions against Russia - as eastern Europe began boosting its defences amid fears of further Kremlin land grabs.



Putin dismissively brushed aside concerns raised by Washington, Brussels and London and inked Crimea's switch to rule by Moscow in defiance of international objections.



He also laughed off punishments imposed by the U.S. and EU on his closest friends and their banks.



Putin opened an account in blacklisted St Petersburg-based Rossiya Bank, which was singled out for sanctions by America, and ordered that his monthly £4,500 salary be paid into the bank.



'I have ordered the administrative department to transfer my salary there,' he said.

Vladamir Putin today said he would be transferring his salary to Russian Bank Rossiya Bank - despite the fact that the U.S. has said that it plans to sanction the organisation

The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, joined him. 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it,' he said.



And Putin joked in abusive slang that a gaggle of oligarchs including Yuriy Kovalchuk and Gennadiy Timchenko - seen by the U.S. as his 'cronies' and subjected to sanctions in support of Kiev - are 'typical moskali', bearing Ukrainian names.



But the Ukrainian premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday said he was signing an EU association deal - the first step to membership - to protect his country from 'armed gangster' Putin.



He insisted 'Russia has undermined the global security system.



'Russia has started to behave like an armed gangster in Europe, therefore we should find an adequate answer to stop an international crime because this is an international crime.'



In slashing a gas subsidy to Ukraine, he was using 'energy as a new nuclear weapon,' he said.

Poland responded by announcing that it will speed up the £3 billion purchase of a missile defence system, with Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz calling the turmoil in neighbouring Ukraine the 'biggest crisis' since escaping the Soviet noose 25 years ago.

France yesterday offered to send four fighter jets to the Baltic states and to ensure twice weekly AWACS patrols.



Yesterday 32 Crimean Tatars has requested refugee status in Poland following Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula.



Meanwhile, Ukraine was plunged into a corruption crisis amid claims that officials in the new government maybe complicit in an alleged £2.5 billion embezzlement scandal involving the Naftogaz state oil and gas company.



Naftogaz chief Yevgen Bakulin is suspected of heading a 'criminal group' whose members include other senior current and former Ukrainian government members.



Bakulin was detained last night after the corruption claims by Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.###5830||Welcome to the new digital hendersondispatch.com!

In U.S. trading on Monday, was up 0.07% at 1.3923.

Investors spent the session digesting events in Europe, after over 90% of Crimean voters on Sunday chose to break with Ukraine and join Russia. Crimea's Parliament on Monday formally asked to join the Russian Federation.

Sanctions followed as expected.

European Union foreign ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people they have linked to the push to have Crimea secede from Ukraine and be annexed by Russia. U.S. President Barack Obama also imposed sanctions on several Russian officials involved in the incursion of Crimea, which included freezing assets in the U.S.

Still, markets were expecting more widespread action from the West, and the response enticed investors away from safe-haven gold positions, which softened the precious metal.

Gold has served as a safe-haven of choice during the Ukraine crisis, and the dollar found room to rise somewhat as gold fell, as the two assets tend to trade inversely with one another.

Hit-or-miss U.S. economic indicators watered down gains.

Data revealed earlier that U.S. industrial production rose 0.6% in February, exceeding expectations for a 0.1% gain. Industrial production in January was revised to a 0.2% fall from a previously estimated 0.3% decline.

In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State manufacturing index ticked up to 5.6 this month from 4.5 in February, missing expectations for a rise to 6.0.

The conflicting data sent many to the sidelines awaiting the Federal Reserve's March decision on monetary policy due out on Wednesday, the first under new Chair Janet Yellen.

Meanwhile in Europe, official data revealed earlier that the euro zone's consumer price index rose 0.3% last month, below expectations for a 0.4% increase, after a 1.1% decline in January.

Year-on-year, consumer price inflation rose 0.7% in February, compared to expectations for a 0.8% increase, after a 0.8% gain in January.

However, core consumer price inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco, rose 0.5% in February, after a 1.7% fall the previous month and in line with market expectations.

The euro zone's core consumer price index rose 1.0% in February, also in line with expectations.

Monetary authorities pay close attention to core consumer prices when deciding policy.

The dollar was up against the yen, with up 0.39% at 101.75, and up against the Swiss franc, with up 0.10% at 0.8730.

The greenback was up against the pound, with down 0.08% at 1.6632.

The dollar was down against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with down 0.45% at 1.1055, up 0.60% at 0.9086 and up 0.40% at 0.8568.

The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.03% at 79.50.

On Tuesday, the U.S. is to produce data on consumer inflation, in addition to reports on building permits and housing starts.###5832||Shoppers wheel their purchases out of a Wal-Mart store in Los Angeles, California - ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images

Starting next week, you can take your old video games to Wal-Mart and get store credit for them. According to Carl Howe, Vice President of Research at the Yankee Group, it's a smart move for the superstore.

"I think what the retailers have found is that there’s a very robust secondary market for games. They’re expensive enough and the demographic that buys games is young enough that they’re pretty cost sensitive."

The used game market in the US is worth more than $1.5 billion, which is not great news for game publishers. Companies like GameStop and Best Buy, however, have deep roots in the used game market.

Wal-Mart does have size on its side. Its hired an outside company to handle refurbishment of the old games that come in, and plans to start selling them at Wal-marts by the end of the year.

* Board member Michael Brown to take over as interim CEO

* Reaffirms fourth-quarter outlook

* Shares fall 10 pct in extended trading (Adds details, analysts’ comments)

By Soham Chatterjee

March 20 (Reuters) - Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” the company said.

“It’s a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company’s turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5 percent organic growth and higher than 30 percent adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5 percent revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.

Symantec had been reorganizing its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

“Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list,” Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. (r.reuters.com/jur77v)

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

British financial markets largely followed that pattern although sterling recovered some recent losses before a raft of potentially market-moving news including the government’s annual budget, Bank of England minutes and unemployment data.

Europe’s major stock markets were down as much as a third of one percent in early trading, following Asian shares lower after the the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.2 percent.

Underlying worries over China’s financial and property sectors bubbled to the surface, pushing Chinese stocks lower and the yuan to its weakest level in a year through 6.20 per dollar.

This is the first time the yuan has traded more than 1 percent beyond the midpoint set by the central bank after the daily trading band was widened to 2 percent.

Global investors’ main focus, however, remain the Fed and Russia.

“I expect gradually the focus to shift away from the tensions between Russia and the West, unless we see actual violence or some type of events other than sanctions that would be seen as an escalation,” Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea in Helsinki, said.

Earlier, pro-Russian units took control of part of a naval base in Ukraine, in the clearest sign so far that Russian soldiers and volunteers who support them had begun to take control of Ukrainian military facilities across the Black Sea peninsula.

Ukraine’s acting defence minister Ihor Tenyukh said shortly after that his country’s forces would not withdraw from Crimea even though Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty to make it part of Russia.

Later on Wednesday in Washington, the Fed is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus by $10 billion a month for a third time in a row and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.

The moves would represent both continuity at the U.S. central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to indications that recent economic weakness is not solely down to harsh winter weather.

By 0900 GMT Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.25 percent at 6,589 points, Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 percent at 9,250 points and France’s CAC 40 was down 0.2 percent at 4,304 points.

The FTSE Eurofirst index of the leading 300 European stocks was flat around 1,305 points.

In currencies, the euro was down slightly at $1.3920, retreating further from last week’s 2-1/2-year high of $1.3967 and was down further against sterling at 83.71 pence.

“Our analysis suggests that sterling is oversold against the euro,” Valentin Marinov, G10 currency strategist at Citi in London, said. “Sterling maybe in for a rebound ahead of the UK labour market data and BoE minutes and the March budget today.”

British finance minister George Osborne will announce a pre-election budget on Wednesday that is likely to offer some tax relief to voters but will stick closely to his tough decade-long plan to fix the public finances.

The British jobs market is expected to show further signs of improvement in February, and investors will scrutinise the latest Bank of England minutes for clues on when rates might be raised.

The dollar was up about 0.2 percent on the day at 101.65 yen. The yen showed little reaction to Japan’s larger-than-expected trade deficit.

In metals, spot gold was down 0.7 percent at $1,346 an ounce, slipping further back from a six-month high of $1,391.76 hit on Monday.

Chancellor George Osborne's facelift for the £1 coin could have unintended consequences for the UK's economy.

Designed to tackle counterfeiting in the UK, the new 12-sided coin should be much harder to forge than existing currency.

The Royal Mint estimates that three per cent of all £1 coins are fakes, or £45m worth.

Some warn that this counterfeiting - in a demand-driven recession - is less of a problem that it might seem.

Ben Southwood, head of macro policy at the Adam Smith Institute, says that production of fake coins means higher aggregate demand, less unemployment, and a narrower output gap.

"While the Bank of England kept policy too tight, counterfeiters were doing their job for them," says Southwood.

But counterfeiting is merely a partial band-aid for the Bank of England's unwillingness to support aggregate demand.

Southwood recommends that as Osborne closes down the counterfeiting route to buoying aggregate demand, "he should open up a more legitimate one, telling the Bank of England to ignore inflation and switch to targeting nominal income or wages."###5840||iNVEZZ.com, Tuesday 18 March:

The ZEW German Economic Sentiment Index for March has checked in today at 46.6, missing by a country mile the market consensus for 52.8 and even more measurably below February’s 55.7. As well, ZEW’s Economic Sentiment Index for the Eurozone has dropped to 61.5 this month, falling short of expectations for a more modest decline to 67.3 from February’s 68.5.

Since the releases, the EUR/USD has dropped to as low as 1.3889, marginally above yesterday’s bottom at 1.3878.

Nordea Markets FX strategist Aurelija Augulyte believes that, contrary to common understanding, the best chance for the US dollar to strengthen against the euro is if the US economic data should continue to surprise to the downside.

“In normal times, the EURUSD will trend higher”, writes Augulyte. By ‘normal times’ she means a period when the US economy is growing and the country is spending more than it’s earning and running a current account deficit.

Augulyte emphasizes that “USD strengthening needs panic, recession, volatility”. In her view, the relatively low volatility since the start of 2014 coupled “with the hope that the US data weakness is temporary has brought the EURUSD up, almost to the projected level (1.3967)”.

The weakness of US data over the winter months has been partly weather-affected, “but to which extent, we will only find out in April/May”, notes the FX strategist. Should the data keep weakening in Q2, then the euro could take a sharper turn lower, but, Augulyte says, Nordea’s official view is that that is not likely to happen.

Augulyte’s baseline scenario is for the EUR/USD to experience “a temporary correction” to 1.365-1.37 before going back to 1.395 and ultimately above 1.40.

Right now, the currency pair is trading at around 1.3915, down 0.07 percent intraday.###5841||Comcast Today: States Will Scrutinize Time Warner Merger, Too

It’s not just the federal government that will scrutinze Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner. The states are coming, too.

Reuters reports:

Florida and other U.S. states will join the Justice Department in seeking to determine if Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable is legal under U.S. antitrust law, Florida said in a statement to Reuters. “We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ (Justice Department) Antitrust Division,” the Florida state attorney general’s office said in an emailed statement. The attorneys general group is focused on broadband rather than cable in assessing the $45.2 billion deal, according to a source familiar with the effort who was not authorized to speak on the record.

It’s in the broadband business that Comcast would actually seem to be in less danger of generating monopoly concerns — in Philadelphia alone, after all, the company has broadband competition from Verizon FIOS and RCN. In cable, meanwhile, a single company is usually regionally dominant. Still, we’ll keep an eye on what the states are doing.

With the ability to also stream more than 25,000 On Demand choices and download thousands of movies and TV shows to watch offline, the app now offers more than 50 live channels to enjoy on-the-go, wherever there is a WiFi connection. “Everything we do revolves around providing our customers with the very best content wherever and whenever they want it, and the Xfinity TV Go app is just another example of that,” Matt Strauss, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Video Services, Comcast Cable. “Xfinity TV customers can now enjoy live programming from more than 50 of the most popular networks. We will continue to aggressively expand both the live and On Demand offerings on the app and provide our customers with the ultimate selection of content across all devices.” (Comcast)

The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 – and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake. Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million. The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.

“Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin” Chancellor George Osborne As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales. A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. "We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit." Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $10bn, it is understood.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400m.

Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39bn.

In the week of Symantec’s firing of CEO Steve Bennett, a leading analyst familiar with the security firm has suggested he lacked the technical expertise for the role.

Bennett, who became CEO less than two years ago, was replaced by board member Michael Brown on an interim basis as the antivirus maker suffered from declining revenue and slumping shares.

A statement released by Symantec said that the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety".

However, Gene Ruth, the leading analyst of Symantec at Gartner, told CBR: "He was not a technical person and it’s possible that the board of directors were looking for someone that has more technical vision and prowess in that area.

"So my guess would be that now that the organisation has been set up and the implementations are underway now, what they need is a technically oriented person who can set the vision for the company, so I’d be looking for someone to come out of a high tech area to fill Steve shoes."

He added: "I sat down with him four days after he took the job and a couple of times after that. He’s a measured type of person, and he seemed quite interested and level-headed… and he knows how to build teams and get productivity out of teams."

The firm reported in January a 5% decline in revenue for the third quarter ending December 27, which Bennett blamed on changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.###5854||Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

The eligible borrowers, who are seeking ideal home purchase or refinancing home loans from TD Bank this Friday, will have to deal with the same interest rates as yesterday, which will certainly not have any serious impact on the overall demand of its loan products in the market.

Today, in the standard, long term home loan department, 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loan deals are being advertised at an interest rate of 4.438% and are carrying an annual percentage rate of 4.551% today. However, in the relatively shorter home financing section, the bank is offering its 15 year fixed rate mortgage home loan deals at an interest rate of 3.438% and an annual return rate of 3.632% this Friday.

With regards to the flexible home loan options, the potential customers can find the best 3 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans being listed against an interest rate of 2.688% and being backed by an APR yield of 2.839% to begin with. On the other hand, the 5 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans are now coming out at an interest price of 3.062% and are backed by an APR yield of 2.961% during the starting years of the home loan tenure.

The safe-haven yen slipped against the dollar as European stocks edged up on expectations the West will impose only limited sanctions on Russia after Ukraine's Crimea region voted in favour of annexation by Moscow.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a referendum to join Russia on Sunday, an outcome that was denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

While the risk of flare-ups in tension between Russia and Ukraine is underpinning demand for safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc, the market's immediate focus this morning is on final euro zone inflation data due at 1000 GMT.

A Reuters poll forecast no revision to the annual rate of 0.8 percent reported for February, but there is a risk it could be revised down, keeping alive concerns about disinflation in the euro zone.

“Our economists expect that the strong 0.8 percent which the flash estimate produced will be revised downwards to 0.7 percent,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank, Frankfurt.

“This combined with fears that the March result might be even lower is likely to keep alive speculation as to whether the ECB might cut rates once more after all.

The area around $1.3970 will have to constitute a natural barrier.

In the end the risk-reward-ratio is more attractive on the downside.”

The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3883, off a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 touched last Thursday, before European Central Bank President Mario Draghi knocked it lower when he voiced concerns about its strength.

Against the yen, the euro was flat at 140.98 yen off a session high of 141.34 yen struck in Asia.

It remained well shy of its March 7 high of 143.79 yen, which was its highest since Jan. 2.

Symantec, which produces Norton Antivirus and other anti-virus software, announced Thursday afternoon that president and CEO Steve Bennett is out, and board member Michael Brown has been elected as interim president and CEO and will take Bennett's place immediately. Symantec said that the search for a permanent CEO will also begin immediately.

The chairman of Symantec's board, Daniel Schulman, said in a statement that Bennett's termination was "not precipitated by any event or impropriety," but rather the result of an ongoing deliberative process. Schulman also said that the board recognizes Bennett's contributions as CEO, which included "developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness."

Bennett has only been Symantec's CEO since July of 2012, and was chairman of Symantec's board from 2011 to 2013. Prior to joining Symantec, Bennett served as president and CEO of technology company Intuit from 2007 to 2011; before that, he had a 23-year career at General Electric , holding management roles in a variety of GE businesses including GE Capital, GE Appliances and GE Medical Systems.

Schulman said that Symantec's priority now is "to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

In the release announcing Bennett's termination, Symantec also reaffirmed its fourth quarter fiscal 2014 outlook, saying that it expects revenue of $1.6 to $1.66 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in the prior-year period. Including special items, it expects its fourth quarter profit to fall somewhere between 29 cents and 31 cents per share compared to 27 cents during the same time in 2013, and excluding those special items expects to see a profit between 40 cents and 42 cents per share, compared to 44 cents per share this same time last year.

Following the news that Bennett has been fired, shares of Symantec halted briefly in Thursday's after-hours trading session after finishing the day with a 1.58%; when trading resumed, shares fell as much as 10%. They've since recovered some of those losses and are currently down about 6.5%. After finishing 2013 trading with a 20% gain, Symantec shares have fallen 12.3% during the first two and a half months of 2014.###5869||Airbnb, the room-letting network, is in advanced talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10bn (£6bn).

The company, which allows people to list spaces to rent including tree-houses, castles or even an astronomic geodesic dome , has previously outlined its aim to become the world’s largest hotelier this year.

Private equity group TPG is likely to lead the fundraising valuation, which could total between $400m and $500m, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Its fundraising valuation will see it overtake Intercontinental Hotel Group’s market value of £4.8bn.

The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, a computer science graduate.

Struggling to pay rent, the trio came up with the idea of renting out three airbeds on their living room floor during a San Francisco design conference which saw most of the city’s hotels being fully booked. The next day they created a website airbedandbreakfast.com, which later became Airbnb.

Over 11 million guests have stayed on Airbnb to date, and Airbnb now lists over 600,000 properties in over 35,000 cities worldwide.

Earlier this week the company reported that over one million guests from the UK have now used the service with Paris, New York, Barcelona and Amsterdam being the most popular destinations.

Mr Blecharczyk told The Sunday Telegraph in November: “InterContinental and Hilton have more than 650,000 rooms. We have 500,000, though they have a much higher occupancy rate.”

Asked if he expects Airbnb to overtake the two groups next year, he replied “yes”.

“If you look at our historical growth curve, I don’t think that’s going to change very quickly,” he added. “We’ve been growing bookings and revenues two to three times every year and I would expect that to continue

The company, which counts Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher as an investor, last raised $2.5bn in 2012 from venture capital investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.

The fundraising attempts come despite an Airbnb horror story going viral after a host wrote a public letter to the company alleging his home was used for a weekend orgy and he was facing eviction from his landlord.

Prostitutes using NYC Airbnb properties as brothels###5870||Empty###5871||The safe-haven yen stayed below a recent peak against the dollar and the euro stood firm on Tuesday as anxiety over the Ukraine crisis ebbed for the time being.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union against Russia following Crimea's weekend vote to join Moscow were seen as too modest to dramatically escalate near-term tensions over the former Soviet republics - reducing demand for flight-to-safety currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc.

The dollar held steady at 101.76 yen, staying above a recent trough near 101.20 yen hit on Friday. The dollar gained some support against the yen after US Treasury yields rose on Monday as safety demand for government debt receded.

The euro edged up 0.1 % to $1.3934, within reach of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 hit on Thursday on diminished expectations of easing by the European Central Bank.

Against the yen, the euro edged up 0.1 % to about 141.79 yen.

After Sunday's referendum in Crimea in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to join Russia, the United States and the European Union on Monday imposed personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.

"In immediate focus is Russian president Putin's speech later today. If he plays down an immediate annexation of Crimea by Russia, the dollar could gain further ground on unwinding of risk aversion," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief strategist at Praevidentia Strategy in Tokyo.

"But an expression of desire for a swift annexation and retaliation against sanctions placed by the European Union and the United States will rekindle economic fears, driving US government bond yields lower and weighing on the dollar," he said.

PUTIN SPEECH President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday will address a special joint session of Russia's State Duma, or parliament, which could take a decision on annexation of the majority ethnic-Russian region.

With Crimea seemingly set to split from Ukraine, market players are watching eastern Ukraine and the possibility of Moscow's involvement in the region with a large population of Russian speakers.

With Russia's armed forces holding war games near the border and Moscow threatening to intervene to halt violence against Russians in Ukraine, some fear Putin will not stop at Crimea and may try to grab more territory in the east and south.

Market players said any re-emergence of tensions would support the yen and Swiss franc.

One possible resistance level for the dollar against the yen now lies around 102.30 yen, said Philip Wee, senior currency economist for DBS Bank in Singapore.

The dollar's 20-day moving average now lies roughly around 102.30 yen, while the 100-day moving average comes in slightly above that level, around 102.38 yen.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 0.8729.

The dollar had hit a 2-1/2-year low of 0.8698 against the Swiss franc last week on trading platform EBS, but has since pulled up from that trough as investor risk aversion ebbed.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against six major currencies, was at 79.355, clinging above a four-month low of 79.268 hit last week.

Investors will watch the US consumer price index and housing-related dated due later in the session for clues to the dollar's likely direction.

Walmart is making plans to begin accepting trade-in video games on March 26, which will put a little bit of heat on GameStop, and other video game stores.

According to GameSpot, Walmart will begin taking trade-ins in 3,100 stores across the U.S, and will give consumers gift cards back as payment. This makes Walmart a little more enticing because the gift card can be used for other purchases within the store, whereas GameStop, they only have games to offer.

GameSpot reported, Walmart will send their games to a refurbishing center and get the games certified. They will also only be taking games and not consoles and hardware.

"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good," said Mac Naughton to GameSpot after being asked why the sudden change. "We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges."

Naughton also said they are planning to give back more money than any other video game trade-in place, pricing the average title at $35.

The NYTimes reported on the incredible profits on used games. It is a $2.4 billion global industry for GameStop alone, which is 27 percent of its sales. In America, GameStop made $1.6 billion on used games and hardware sales alone.

"It's extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins," said Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities to the NYTimes.

Used games are a touchy subject and a source of contention among developers and console makers as used game sales take away from new games sales, costing companies millions of dollars. However, it is a necessary evil because gamers will keep buying and selling games to grow their collections.

Microsoft tried to implement a used game system on the Xbox One that would require gamers to only register a game twice, and not work with used games. After public outcry, they reversed the policy.###5873||£1bn equity release milestone reached For the first time, more than £1bn has been unlocked through equity release in a single quarter.

Mulberry was the it-brand a few years ago, its handbags adorning the arms of every celeb worth their salt, from the Duchess of Cambridge to Alexa Chung (who had a satchel named after her). However, after just two years in charge of the luxury fashion house and three profit warnings in the space of 18 months, boss Bruno Guillon has left.



‘I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years. He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales,’ said Godfrey Davis, who has been promoted from non-exec chairman to exec chairman until the company finds a successor to Guillon.



A tad disingenuous perhaps, given the brand’s struggle to sell its pricey bags in Asia last year. Mulberry’s troubles have also coincied with the exit of creative director Emma Hill, credited with giving the company that je ne sais quoi. Hill quit in June last year amid rumours she’d fallen out with Guillon over pushing up prices.



Investors took the news of Guillon’s departure rather well – shares were up almost 2% in mid-morning trading. After the Frenchman presided over a 66% slump in the share price, shareholders will be hoping Mulberry can find the next big thing.

Source: Yahoo Finance###5875||NEW YORK — Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade in their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores.

Starting next week, customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam”s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

The world”s largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market. It”s a business that”s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world”s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart”s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers for in return for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games. The latter was an apparent reference to GameStop”s program.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They”ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think the move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn”t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

And Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia pointed out that GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it”s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers” grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer”s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###5876||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

During the first three months of 2014, Fannie Mae expects mortgage production at all U.S. lenders to total $227 billion.

All three of Ohio's largest banks passed the latest round of stress tests mandated by regulators, meaning they would be expected to survive if the economy collapsed like it did six years ago.

Only one of the 30 banks most significant to the U.S. financial system, Zions Bank of Salt Lake City, didn't pass the stress test imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Locally, KeyCorp of Cleveland, Fifth Third of Cincinnati and Huntington of Columbus all passed, as did three other banks with a significant presence in Northeast Ohio: PNC, Chase and U.S. Bank.

The tests have been assessed four times since 2009 on the 18 most significant banks. This year, however, 12 banks with more than $50 billion in assets were added. That added banks like Huntington.

The tests look at how the bank would fare if it were pounded by loan losses and were hemorrhaging capital.

Specifically, regulators looked at the health of the banks if the economy was hit by a deep recession with high unemployment, a tanking stock market and a drop in home values to 2001 levels.

In addition, the tests this year looked at what would happen if a bank's largest counterparty defaulted.

One part of the stress test looked at potential loan loss rates among the banks. Key, Fifth Third and Huntington all were below the average of 5.6 percent.



In this post-meltdown era, banks must get approval for things they spend capital on, such as dividends paid to shareholders and purchases of other banks. The Federal Reserve next week will release results on whether the banks' requests for their capital have been approved.



###5880||Russia's SMP Bank says that Visa and MasterCard have stopped processing transactions for its clients after the US imposed sanctions on its major shareholders.

On Thursday SMP Bank's owners - brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - were among 20 Russians hit by US sanctions after president Vladimir Putin moved to annex the region of Crimea.



Within hours and without notification, card giants Visa and MasterCard reacted by cutting off payment services for SMP customers.



In a statement to Reuters, the bank says: "Due to the fact that the sanctions were imposed on shareholders and not on the bank, we consider the moves by the payment systems unlawful and we are confident that we can resolve the encountered difficulties in the near future."



Arkady Rotenberg has close tie with Putin, dating back to when the pair were members of the same judo club. The US says that the brothers have given "support to Putin's pet projects" and received billions of dollars in contracts related to the recent Sochi Olympic Games.



The 20 people targeted in the latest round of sanctions have "substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership," says president Barack Obama.



A financial institution, Bank Rossiya, has also been hit and will be frozen out of dollar transactions.



Update

Visa and MasterCard have told Reuters that they have now resumed processing transactions for SMP customers.###5881||Shoppers wheel their purchases out of a Wal-Mart store in Los Angeles, California - ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images

Starting next week, you can take your old video games to Wal-Mart and get store credit for them. According to Carl Howe, Vice President of Research at the Yankee Group, it's a smart move for the superstore.

"I think what the retailers have found is that there’s a very robust secondary market for games. They’re expensive enough and the demographic that buys games is young enough that they’re pretty cost sensitive."

The used game market in the US is worth more than $1.5 billion, which is not great news for game publishers. Companies like GameStop and Best Buy, however, have deep roots in the used game market.

Wal-Mart does have size on its side. Its hired an outside company to handle refurbishment of the old games that come in, and plans to start selling them at Wal-marts by the end of the year.

BEFORE YOU GO###5882||Investing.com - The pound on Tuesday slipped against the dollar, which saw relief demand after Russian President Vladimir Putin assured the world he has no plans to annex Ukraine.

In U.S. trading on Tuesday, was trading at 1.6584, down 0.32%, up from a session low of 1.6546 and off a high of 1.6647.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6383, the low from Feb. 10, and resistance at 1.6666, Monday's high.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine," signaling that Russia's moves in the area would be limited.

The speech came one day after President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters opting to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy, which came at the pound's expense.

Trading was somewhat edgy, as CNN reported that Ukraine Defense Ministry Spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Elsewhere, mixed U.S. housing and consumer inflation data watered down the dollar's gains against the pound albeit slightly.

The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.

The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase..

U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Sterling was down against the euro, with up 0.33% at 0.8396, and down against the yen, with down 0.58% at 168.31.

On Wednesday, markets will pay close attention to the Federal Reserve.

The U.S. central bank is to announce its decision on interest rates and monetary policy followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen, her first as head of the monetary authority.###5883||Empty###5884||Empty###5885||Airbnb may raise a massive $500 million round with a valuation of $10 billion, according to an anonymously sourced report from the Wall Street Journal.

###5887||Empty###5888||Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has led a massive US$280m Series D round in messaging app Tango, literally weeks after Facebook spent US$19bn to acquire WhatsApp.

The move shows the heat hasn’t gone out of mobile and social messaging just yet.

Alibaba is understood to have contributed US$215m to the round. The investment values the Silicon Valley start-up at around US$1bn.

So far, Tango has raised US$367m in funding from DFJ, Qualcomm and Yahoo! co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang.

Tango allows users to send free text messages, photos and video messages over their phones.

It also has something of its own social network in the making, where users can send updates and play games.

Tango has so far attracted more than 200m users, more than double its user base a year ago.

It is estimated that about 70m people log into the app on a weekly basis. Its users are typically aged between 25 and 45.

Vision of the founders

Tango was forged in 2009 by CEO Uri Raz and CTO Eric Setton, initially as a competitor to Apple’s FaceTime. However, it quickly realised it could provide an alternative by breaking beyond the confines of iOS and embracing Android, as well.

“We launched Tango in September 2009 out of the personal need to stay connected to our own families,” the founders wrote in their blog.

“It helped tremendously that both of us came from deep video technology backgrounds and had strong entrepreneurial spirits. But it was the emotional connection with family living in other parts of the world that inspired our mission here at Tango. Back then we felt that free online communication through texts, voice and video calls would remove barriers and change the world. The world agreed: we signed up our first million members in the first 10 days after launch.”

The platform has evolved to allow users to communicate around photos, music, voice and video messages, as well as video games.

It has even created its own SDK for developers to create Tango-powered games.

“While we’ve made progress on our mission to enable people to communicate, share and feel more connected, we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible. The opportunity for Tango goes well beyond just providing a messaging app for free communications. We see an even bigger opportunity – one where people can have access to free communication, social networking features and enjoyable content – all within a single platform.

“Over the past eight months, Tango has evolved. We’ve introduced a content platform that is now home to more than 30 games. We’ve introduced new social networking features that allow members to share updates or photos and to find new friends. And we’ve introduced social music sharing through integration with Spotify, which means members can now send each other songs.

“Quite honestly, the results have blown us away. We’re excited by the 2x increase in daily engagement since last July. And we love it that our members are huge fans of music and love to send hundreds of millions of songs to their friends through Tango. These changes are reflected in huge growth in registered users: over the last year we’ve doubled to more than 200m,” Raz and Setton said.###5889||Time Warner Cable is on the verge of merging with Comcast, but as the contractual paperwork begins to take effect, the cable company has to deal with another legal matter of the courtroom variety. The Los Angeles City Attorney’s office announced March 14 it filed a lawsuit against Time Warner seeking nearly $10 million.

According to a statement released by City Attorney Mike Feuer, Time Warner has allegedly refused to pay fees to the municipality despite “raking in billions of dollars of revenue.”

“The City of Los Angeles enabled Time Warner to make billions and in turn they shortchanged the taxpayers millions,” Feuer stated.

ADVERTISEMENT

Specifically, the lawsuit seeks $9,697,896 from Time Warner, including more than $2.5 million in fees owed for 2008 and 2009, plus nearly $7.2 million for 2010 and 2011.

The money allegedly owed is for franchise Public, Educational, and Government (PEG) fees.

“Time Warner Cable … has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the City of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the City of Los Angeles … fully for this privilege,” the opening salvo of the 24-page complaint alleges.

City attorneys made two contentions to support its allegations against Time Warner.

“Time Warner enjoys a virtual monopoly for the provision of cable television services to the residents of the City, and it has blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the City resulting from the grant of that effective monopoly,” the complaint asserted.

The funds City Hall alleges have not been paid by Time Warner could have been used to pay for “core services,” such as fire and police protection, sanitation services, and operation of libraries, parks, and senior centers, the complaint continued.

Since 1986, City Hall has authorized “local cable franchises” divided into geographic segments within city limits.

“The Cable Act (and California law) permitted the City to require an operator to assume certain obligations in return for the non-exclusive right to occupy valuable public property – the rights-of-way – to build a system to provide cable,” the complaint stated.

In exchange for the “right to occupy valuable public property,” City Hall was authorized under the Cable Act (also known as the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984) to collect a franchise fee equal to five percent of the operator’s gross revenues.

The Act also allowed a city could enforce requirements for PEG facilities and equipment.

City Hall issued 12 local franchises to Time Warner, according to the complaint.

The complaint details City Hall’s relationship with Time Warner and how that relationship may have changed in light of new state legislation and a law enforcement action filed in 2008 by Los Angeles against the cable provided and alleging deceptive, fraudulent, and unfair practices.

Mike Dundas, a deputy city attorney, will oversee the litigation.###5890||Empty###5891||Empty###5892||Malaysia’s police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the simulator, taken from the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, showed its data log had been cleared on Feb. 3, more than a month before the airliner, carrying 239 people, disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian to Beijing.

“The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,” he told a news conference.

No wreckage has been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8, less than an hour after taking off.

Malaysia has now made available to the FBI electronic data generated by both pilots of Flight MH370, including data from a hard drive attached to the captain’s flight simulator, and from electronic media used by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters.

The official said he could not confirm that some data had been wiped from the simulator and stressed that there was no guarantee the FBI analysis would turn up any fresh clues.

U.S. investigators had become increasingly frustrated in recent days that Malaysian authorities had not asked them for more help.

The FBI has extensive experience investigating airplane crashes, including those of TWA 800 and EgyptAir 990 off the U.S. East Coast in the 1990s and Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

In the case of EgyptAir 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot, while in the case of Pan Am 103, the agency worked with British and U.S. intelligence to build a case against the government of Libya.

In Kuala Lumpur, at the headquarters of a search operation that has so far turned up few leads, Chinese relatives’ anger over sparse information on the fate of their relatives sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday.

Malaysia’s transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency.

“They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don’t know how long we have to wait,” cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum.

Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish.

“Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,” he said in a statement.

Dwindling hopes

Prospects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north.

“Our top priority is being given to that area,” Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.

It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 230,000 square miles roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.

The unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER had focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia’s Sumatra island to west of Australia.

“The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,” said a source close to the investigation.

That view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.

Some sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could stall due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took.

Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.

“These are basically spy planes; that’s what they were designed for,” said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters.

Hishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance.

“The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,” he told the news conference, held in aKuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations.

Deliberately diverted

Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.

If the plane did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.

Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital data links: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.

U.S. agencies have looked for evidence that anyone other than the pilots knew how disable ACARS but have found nothing.###5893||Empty###5894||After many rumors and even a brief trial program, Walmart is finally following Best Buy, Amazon and, of course, GameStop in taking trade-ins of used games.

But there is no certainly it will be weighing down pockets north of the border because of the little matter of Scottish independence.

Chancellor George Osborne will today announce that the UK is to get the ultra-secure £1 coin. However, Treasury sources made clear it would come into force in Scotland only if there was a No vote in September's referendum.

The new coin will have the same shape as the old 12-sided three pence piece, known in pre-decimalisation days as the "thrupenny bit".

The current £1 coin has been in circulation for more than 30 years, which is much longer than the normal life cycle of a British coin. But it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters. Of the 1.5billion in circulation, the Royal Mint estimates 3%, representing £45m, are fakes. In some parts of the UK, the number of forgeries is as high as 6%.

The Treasury explained that while law enforcement agencies were successfully cracking down on the counterfeiters, the only sustainable way forward was to introduce a new, highly secure coin, that would reduce costs to business and the taxpayer.

The expectation is the new coin will be introduced in 2017. It is intended that, as with the current £1 coin, its obverse side will have images that represent the different parts of the UK.

But a senior Whitehall source stressed that, because all the main Westminster parties had ruled out a currency union between the UK and Scotland in the event of a Yes vote, then there would be no new Scottish £1 coin if Scots opted for independence. "The new coin would not be legal tender in Scotland and so would never come into circulation there," he explained.

The Royal Mint says the new £1 coin will be the most secure in the world. It will be of bi-metallic construction, consisting of two colours, and will include systems that will incorporate three tiers of banknote-strength security.

"After 30 years' loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," said a senior Treasury source.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it is vital we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."

The source pointed out there would be a consultation with industry, but insisted any changeover costs to business would be kept to a minimum because of new technology. The Payments Council, the Automatic Vending Association, the British Retail Consortium and the British Parking Association all welcomed the announcement.

He said the new design was a "fitting tribute" to Britain's heritage, sharing the same shape as the old three pence coin, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. The old threepenny bit was the first to have the dodecagon shape, which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War as its distinctiveness made it the easiest coin to recognise during the air-raid blackouts.###5900||* Sees significant rise in pretax profit in 2014

* Sees record sales in 2014 of more than 2 mln cars

* Launch of new models, higher production to drive sales

* Shares up 6.8 pct, biggest gainer on pan-European index (Removes extraneous text from headline)

By Edward Taylor

MUNICH, March 19 (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker BMW is looking at raising production capacity at its plant in the United States and releasing 12 new models as it chases record sales and a rise in pretax profit of up to 10 percent this year.

BMW’s plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is being readied to reach an annual production capacity of around 350,000 vehicles, up from 300,000 at the end of 2013. It makes sport utility vehicles including the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models.

“The U.S. will stay a market with great potential for us. This is why we are evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity in the U.S.”, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company’s annual results press conference on Wednesday.

Analysts welcomed the outlook from the Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands.

“We see BMW’s confidence as a major positive trigger for the stock,” analysts at ISI Global said in a note to clients.

BMW shares were up 6.8 percent at 86.207 euros at 1301 GMT, the biggest gainers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .

Reithofer declined to give a figure about future production levels at Spartanburg, or comment on whether BMW is thinking about producing a new model, the X7. The carmaker said it will make a further announcement about its U.S. plans on March 28.

Investments made at plants in China will allow BMW to raise production capacity there to 400,000 cars, from 300,000 in 2013.

BMW reiterated its aim to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014 to 2 million or more, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

“We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions,” Reithofer said.

Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner later said a “significant rise” meant “somewhere in the range of a high single-digit and a double-digit amount.”

Last week, BMW reported its automotive division’s fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

The forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable and on a steady recovery in European markets, BMW said.

BMW expects significant growth in markets outside Europe including high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in China.

The car maker said it expected sales in the second half of 2014 to be higher than in the first six months as a result of a large number of model launches, including the compact 2-series coupe and the 2-series Active Tourer.

BMW is also launching the i8, a diesel hybrid sportscar made of carbon fiber, later this year with a starting price of around 126,000 euros.

BMW board member for sales and marketing Ian Robertson said the i8 will have an initial production run of 1,000 vehicles.

BMW will make greater use of carbon fiber in other models from its vehicle range, and is developing the next generation Z4 roadster together with Toyota Motor Corp., Robertson said.

Separately, BMW published it annual report, which showed that CEO Reithofer received total compensation of 7.03 million euros in 2013, a 6 percent increase on the previous year.

Shares of GameStop plunged 5% in morning trading on Tuesday after Wal-Mart announced it was entering a prime space for the video game chain: used games.

Wal-Mart unveiled its new used games service, which will allow consumers to trade in older video games and apply it to any item purchased at Wal-Mart or Sam's Club. The program kicks off March 26.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart, in a blog post.

The used games industry has been dominated by GameStop, which makes a healthy chunk of its revenue off trade-ins. Wal-Mart isn't the only retailer to wade into the used games market. Both Amazon and Best Buy host similar services.

Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia estimates 43% of Gamestop's gross profit dollars come from their used games business.

Meanwhile, Microsoft stock is up 4.2% following reports the company plans on making its Office software available for Apple's iPad.

According to The Verge, Microsoft plans to host an event next week where it will unveil a version of its suite of Office apps for the Apple tablet. The report says the interface and features will be similar to the Office app for iPhone.

Also, Hewlett-Packard shares are up nearly 2% after Barclay's upgraded the personal computer maker's stock to "overweight." As CNBC reports, Barclay's thinks HP can improve how it implements its tech services and gain share in its x86 enterprise server business.

###5911||(Updates with details of other litigation facing Credit Suisse)

By Nate Raymond and Silke Koltrowitz

NEW YORK/ZURICH, March 21 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay $885 million to resolve claims by a U.S. regulator that the Swiss bank misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.

The settlement announced on Friday would resolve claims in two lawsuits filed in New York by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies.

It is the ninth settlement that the FHFA has reached in litigation that began in 2011, when it filed 18 lawsuits over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the recent global financial crisis.

The accord resolves claims pending in New York federal court against Credit Suisse over $16.6 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and ends what the Swiss bank called the largest mortgage-related investor litigation it still faced.

Credit Suisse will pay $234 million to Fannie Mae and $651 million to Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.

So far, the FHFA has recovered more than $10.1 billion from banks over similar securities.

This includes nearly $9.8 billion in settlements of litigation with such banks as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The FHFA also reached a separate $335.2 million accord with Wells Fargo & Co, which it did not formally sue.

Many of the settlements were reached after a series of series of court rulings that went against the banks.

Lawsuits remain pending against several other banks, including Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

Credit Suisse said on Friday it will reduce previously reported fourth-quarter and 2013 results by 275 million Swiss francs ($311.17 million) after taxes for the settlement, resulting in a fourth-quarter net loss of 8 million Swiss francs.

While Credit Suisse said the settlement resolves the biggest mortgage case it faced, the bank still must deal with other mortgage cases in the United States, including ones by the National Credit Union Administration and attorneys general in New York and New Jersey.

Credit Suisse is also one of 14 Swiss banks targeted by U.S. prosecutors for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank has said it is trying to settle that matter.

Last month, the Zurich-based bank agreed to pay $196.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it provided unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients.

The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06200.###5912||This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

The rate was 4.3 percent in January compared to 4.2 percent in December.

The rate was 5.0 percent last January. The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent -- the lowest national rate since October 2008.

"Despite a slight increase in the January unemployment rate, Iowa's unemployment conditions have improved substantially from one year ago," said Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development in a news release issued Monday. "The state's annual average unemployment rate for 2013 dropped to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2012. Iowa had the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation in 2013."

INDEPTH LOOK AT STATS:

Iowa nonfarm employment decreased by 7,300 jobs in January, lowering the total to 1,536,900. The monthly drop was dominated by larger-than-expected service sector layoffs in trade and transportation, as seasonal workers were laid off. In the goods-producing sector, construction also contributed to the loss.



Government was down 800 jobs in local and federal government, outweighing the gains in state government. Nonfarm employment has steadily trended upward despite the recent weakness, and is currently 19,500 jobs higher than one year ago (+1.3 percent).

Professional and business services added the most jobs in January (+1,600), partly due to early seasonal hiring in accounting and tax specialty firms. This monthly gain more than offset the slight loss in temporary help services. Financial activities added 900 jobs to offset smaller losses over the last few months. This sector has been resilient in Iowa, and is 900 jobs higher than a year ago and also at an all-time high.



Alternatively, retail trade accounted for over half of the jobs lost this month (-4,500), which was largely due to retail stores reducing their staff to pre-holiday levels. Transportation and warehousing industries also dropped employment (900), reflecting the seasonal layoffs of package delivery couriers. The construction sector pared jobs for the second month in a row (-2,600). However, the outlook for this sector is bright with the demand for new residential housing and commercial buildings on the rise.

Compared to last January, nonfarm employment has added 19,500 jobs. As a result of the annual benchmark revision, manufacturing is once again leading all sectors in year-over-year gains (+4,100). Education and health services followed closely behind (+4,000), and professional and business services ranked in third place (+3,900). Information services has been on a downward trend for the past decade, and trails last year’s level by 800 jobs. Construction is down a slight 400 jobs from one year ago.

(WMT) said that customers will be able to trade in their video games starting Wednesday, March 26 and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online.

The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

"Gaming continues to be an important for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

The company asked customers to bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department. It said that associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks. The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept. The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam's Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com.

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary, the company said.

Walmart stated that customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com, later this year. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

It’s not just the federal government that will scrutinze Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner. The states are coming, too.

Reuters reports:

Florida and other U.S. states will join the Justice Department in seeking to determine if Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable is legal under U.S. antitrust law, Florida said in a statement to Reuters. “We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ (Justice Department) Antitrust Division,” the Florida state attorney general’s office said in an emailed statement. The attorneys general group is focused on broadband rather than cable in assessing the $45.2 billion deal, according to a source familiar with the effort who was not authorized to speak on the record.

It’s in the broadband business that Comcast would actually seem to be in less danger of generating monopoly concerns — in Philadelphia alone, after all, the company has broadband competition from Verizon FIOS and RCN. In cable, meanwhile, a single company is usually regionally dominant. Still, we’ll keep an eye on what the states are doing.

From Comcast PR:

• Today, Comcast announced the addition of 18 live streaming channels to the Xfinity TV Go app:

With the ability to also stream more than 25,000 On Demand choices and download thousands of movies and TV shows to watch offline, the app now offers more than 50 live channels to enjoy on-the-go, wherever there is a WiFi connection. “Everything we do revolves around providing our customers with the very best content wherever and whenever they want it, and the Xfinity TV Go app is just another example of that,” Matt Strauss, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Video Services, Comcast Cable. “Xfinity TV customers can now enjoy live programming from more than 50 of the most popular networks. We will continue to aggressively expand both the live and On Demand offerings on the app and provide our customers with the ultimate selection of content across all devices.” (Comcast)

By Phil Wahba

March 19 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday called on eBay Inc to sell 20 percent of its PayPal payments unit in an initial public offering, a change in tack from his previous call for a complete spinoff.

Icahn in January called for eBay to hive off its fast growing PayPal business, arguing the unit is undervalued as part of eBay.

In recent weeks, Icahn has sent a series of open letters critical of eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe, the board, and corporate governance at the e-commerce company.

In his latest missive to fellow eBay shareholders, he said selling off only part of PayPal would retain the benefits of a stand-alone PayPal while maintaining the efficiencies of having eBay and PayPal together.

“A partial separation of PayPal is not a new idea, and we’re glad to see that Mr. Icahn now seems to agree that a full separation of PayPal is not a good idea,” eBay said in a statement, re-iterating its position that the two businesses are better off under the same umbrella.

As a public company, the payments firm should also command a higher valuation than as part of a larger corporation, shedding the “conglomerate discount,” Icahn said. Its stock could then also be used to bankroll future acquisitions.

“Conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal - and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses - will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,” said Icahn, who owns more than 2 percent of eBay.

EBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002.

The billionaire Icahn said eBay and PayPal could enter into a long-term commercial contract that does not require eBay to own all of PayPal, to preserve their ties.

He also said PayPal has a significant opportunity to offer new services such as check writing and direct deposits.

A standalone PayPal and eBay would benefit from having their own independent management teams, Icahn argued.

PayPal needs to be independent to compete in the mobile payments industry, Icahn said, repeating an assertion he has frequently made in a series of open letters in recent weeks. (Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; editing by Andrew Hay and Tom Brown)###5928||Empty###5929||A market dominated by GameStop is about to see another huge entrant as Walmart is set to launch a used video game purchasing program next week across its nationwide network of 3,100 retail stores. The Wall Street Journal reports that Walmart will begin buying used games next week and will pay gamers anywhere from a few dollars to $35 or more for used titles. Payments will be made in the form of Walmart gift cards that can be used to purchase any products from Walmart stores or the company’s website.

Walmart’s move into the space that has traditionally been dominated by GameStop comes as sales of Microsoft and Sony’s next-generation video game consoles really get underway. Despite the surge in console hardware sales, however, new software sales are still lagging — likely thanks in part to the large market for buying and selling used games.

Where gamers are concerned, Walmart’s move could lead to increased competition for used game acquisition. This could mean more money and more promotions ultimately being made available to gamers as Walmart, GameStop and other retailers battle for business.###5930||Text size

GameStop shares are being zapped on worries about Wal-Mart 's entry into the used-videogame market.

Early Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores (ticker: WMT) announced that on March 26 it would begin accepting used videogames from customers, who could then use the value of their trade-in for any purchases at the chain or at its Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart will in turn refurbish the games and sell them in "like-new condition."

While Wal-Mart was flat in recent trading, GameStop (GME) shares fell 4.2% to $38.06 on the news. However, we think the market is underestimating GameStop's expertise and staying power.

Certainly, Wal-Mart's entering the fray is a near-term negative for GameStop, as it provides a new competitor and headline risk for the stock.

Yet this is not the first time that a bigger, deeper-pocketed retailer has tried and failed to thrive in the used-videogame market. As Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Arvind Bhatia notes, companies from Best Buy (BBY) to Target (TGT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have tried to move in on GameStop's business.

"Some of them have made multiple attempts over the years, including Best Buy, which we recall has attempted it at least on four different occasions in the last console cycle. None of the retailers so far has had much success. It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well. However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying 1 disc at a time from customers," notes Bhatia.

Bhatia argues that GameStop has "many inherent competitive advantages as the expert in video games" that make it difficult for others to steal its business: The company has a dedicated refurbishing center, an algorithm for pricing perfected over the past decade, and a customer loyalty program.

Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson is another bull, who advises buying the stock on Tuesday's weakness, as he thinks Wal-Mart's impact will be "immaterial" to GameStop's used-videogame business. He notes that Wal-Mart will be at a disadvantage to GameStop because "GameStop typically offers both cash and store credit (Wal-Mart offering only store credit); GameStop accepts both video game hardware and software, which gamers often trade-in together (Wal-Mart accepts only software) [and] GameStop is a destination for gamers (Wal-Mart sells video game hardware and software, but this is a small sub-segment of their business)."

And while GameStop may not be close in size to the world's largest retailer, it is a healthy company with dominant market share. It's debt free, with about $5 per share of cash on its balance sheet, which it has used to boost its generous 3.4% yield and buy back shares.

Early this year, Barron's recommended GameStop shares, arguing that investors were overreacting to the company's weak holiday sales. (See Follow Up, "GameStop Has 50% Upside," Jan. 18). The shares are up 1.6% since that article's publication, just edging ahead of the Standard & Poor's 500's return during the same period.

Even skeptics note that GameStop isn't resting on its laurels. S&P Capital IQ analyst Efraim Levy, who downgraded the stock to Hold on the news, notes that "GameStop is already adjusting to increasing its focus on sales of digital content and for mobile devices."

Levy's new price target assumes a valuation of 11 times 2015 earnings, but with today's dip the shares are already trading at just over 10 times.

So it's too soon to count out GameStop.

E-mail: teresa.rivas@barrons.com###5931||Empty###5932||Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group has paid $215m for a minority stake in mobile messaging app maker Tango.

Tango said it raised $280m (£169m, €202m) in a new funding round led by the Chinese firm. Tango's prior investors, Access Industries, venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, also contributed.

The investment gives Alibaba a minority stake in the four-year-old company, estimated at between 20% and 25% by research firm VC Experts. The deal, which values Tango at about $1.1bn, is believed to be Alibaba's biggest investment in a US firm to date.

Tango has 200 million registered users and 70 million active users, with a significant footprint spread across North America, the Middle East, Taiwan and Singapore.

Tango co-founder Eric Setton told Reuters that his company, which offers games, multimedia sharing and other content, would in due course beat WhatsApp, which offers purely text and voice communications.

However the killer potential of apps like Tango and WhatsApp is that they allow users to send free texts or make free calls over a data connection, posing a growing threat to incumbent carriers.

"The platform approach I believe is the winning strategy," Setton said.

"We've now seen it in a number of key markets, with Kakao in Korea or Line in Japan."

Alibaba IPO

Alibaba is understood to have selected New York over Hong Kong for its forthcoming initial public offering.

The gargantuan US flotation is expected to value Alibaba at as much as $120bn (£72bn, €87bn).

Another given is that Alibaba will use the proceeds of the planned share sale to snap up a raft of companies, in a bid to expand its mobile phone services.

Competition

The Tango deal comes a month after social media giant Facebook's shocking $19bn acquisition of five-year old WhatsApp.

Alibaba has long recognised the threat posed by Chinese social media major Tencent's WeChat, a hugely popular messaging app that has evolved into an e-commerce platform.

Alibaba recently introduced a WeChat competitor called Laiwang, but the service has struggled to gain traction.###5933||Share

Starting on March 26, Walmart starts taking on GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, and a number of other retailers with a video game trade-in program, the company confirms. You’ll be able to sell off your old games at any of the more than 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a gift card for use online or in-store at any Walmart or Sam’s Club. This also means that Walmart’s getting into the used game sales business, with all re-sold discs sent off to be refurbished before being restocked on store shelves (or kept as inventory for online sales) at a lower price.

The program works just like others of this sort. You bring your game in its original packaging to the electronics department of one of the company’s stores. A customer service rep will inspect each disc for cracks and other defects and tells you what it’s all worth. Then you get your money, in the form of a gift card. Simple stuff.

The program builds on Walmart’s existing trade-in program, that allows customers to sell off old smartphones and tablets. You can find more info on the newly expanded trade-in program on Walmart’s official website.###5934||Empty###5935||Bruno Guillon has stepped down as chief executive of luxury handbag maker Mulberry ( ) with immediate effect.

Guillon has led the AIM-listed company since March 2012 when he took over from Godfrey Davis, who then became non-executive chairman.

Davis will take up the role of executive chairman until a successor is found.

It follows falling sales and a profit warning at the end of January.

British shoppers crossed Alexa satchels off their Christmas wish lists despite heavy discounts, while Korea is also proving a more difficult market to crack than expected.

“I, along with the Board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” said Davis.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

###5936||Airbnb, the room-letting network, is in advanced talks to raise funds that would value the company at more than $10bn (£6bn).

The company, which allows people to list spaces to rent including tree-houses, castles or even an astronomic geodesic dome , has previously outlined its aim to become the world’s largest hotelier this year.

Private equity group TPG is likely to lead the fundraising valuation, which could total between $400m and $500m, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Its fundraising valuation will see it overtake Intercontinental Hotel Group’s market value of £4.8bn.

The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, a computer science graduate.

Struggling to pay rent, the trio came up with the idea of renting out three airbeds on their living room floor during a San Francisco design conference which saw most of the city’s hotels being fully booked. The next day they created a website airbedandbreakfast.com, which later became Airbnb.

Over 11 million guests have stayed on Airbnb to date, and Airbnb now lists over 600,000 properties in over 35,000 cities worldwide.

Earlier this week the company reported that over one million guests from the UK have now used the service with Paris, New York, Barcelona and Amsterdam being the most popular destinations.

Mr Blecharczyk told The Sunday Telegraph in November: “InterContinental and Hilton have more than 650,000 rooms. We have 500,000, though they have a much higher occupancy rate.”

Asked if he expects Airbnb to overtake the two groups next year, he replied “yes”.

“If you look at our historical growth curve, I don’t think that’s going to change very quickly,” he added. “We’ve been growing bookings and revenues two to three times every year and I would expect that to continue

The company, which counts Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher as an investor, last raised $2.5bn in 2012 from venture capital investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.

The fundraising attempts come despite an Airbnb horror story going viral after a host wrote a public letter to the company alleging his home was used for a weekend orgy and he was facing eviction from his landlord.

Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to "shake up" the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

There are 880 million video games sitting in homes today, Mac Naughton said. And according to a cited NPD report, 80 percent of these games, or more than 700 million, are rarely played. Clearly, there is a market for second-hand games, just look at GameStop's quarterly revenue for evidence of that. But why trade these games in at Wal-Mart instead of GameStop or Best Buy?

Wal-Mart's "true differentiator," Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can't compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It's credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.

Wal-Mart will accept all games (provided they are not scratched or damaged beyond repair) and refurbish them via a third-party company. These games will then be sold at stores and online with a "certified pre-owned" label on their packaging. Wal-Mart expects to have a solid inventory of secondhand games available this summer.

GameStop has its own dedicated refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas and it is this very operation that management believes sets GameStop apart from competitors. We've reached out to Gamestop for comment on this story but we have not heard back.

Just because Wal-Mart is getting into the used game market, it doesn't mean the company is backing away from new games anytime soon. The company's new release business will "remain a focus" for Wal-Mart going forward, Mac Naughton said.

But why get into the secondhand market now, in 2014, when an increasing amount of attention is paid to download services? It's a question we poised to Mac Naughton and he said Wal-Mart isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many. Still, he explained that Wal-Mart is indeed eyeing the digital market as a future growth opportunity.

"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good," he said. "We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges."

Wal-Mart's move into the used-game market will also conceivably affect publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, which do not participate in second-hand sales. We've also reached out to these companies, but have not heard back. We'll have more in the future.

Finally, though Mac Naughton never mentioned GameStop by name during the call, he said Wal-Mart's aim with its secondhand program is to "pay more than anybody else" for your old games. Of course, trade-in prices will vary, but he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.

Here's how Wal-Mart's used-game program works:###5941||Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

Private-equity firm TPG Capital is expected to lead the funding over the next few weeks -- negotiations are still in progress -- possibly bringing in up to $400 million for the property rental upstart.

The idea for Airbnb was conceived in 2008 by three Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard graduates who relocated to San Francisco, originally calling the site Airbedandbreakfast.com.

Since its inception, Airbnb has become a leader in the share economy. The site is a destination for millions of tourists looking for cheap rooms, while giving homeowners a new source of income.

Airbnb's reach spans 160 countries with more than 600,000 listings, and the site has accommodated 11 million guests in its five-year history, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company said it had a record 250,000 guests in one night on New Year's Eve 2013.

The hotel industry has begun to take notice of the company's tremendous growth.

Airbnb has cut into the industry's market share by offering cheap prices and unconventional accommodations. For example, a person can stay in a large treehouse in Hawaii for under $100 a night, much less than comparable hotel prices in the area.

The novelty of the living arrangement, along with the cheap rates, has many tourists checking with Airbnb before looking into more traditional accommodations. Airbnb takes 3% from a host's booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.

The hotel industry has complained, saying that the site is not subject to the same regulation and tax structure that traditional hotels are, making the competition unfair.

Homeowners in New York and San Francisco have questioned the legality of Airbnb's practices regarding subletting property, and tenants say the site has diminished the supply of rental properties, driving up long-term rents.

Amid the criticism, current valuations of Airbnb make it worth more than Hyatt Hotels (H), valued at $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), valued at $9.39 billion, signaling investors see the site as the possible future of travel stay.

TPG Capital's new round of funding indicates that a public offering may be in the company's future. That would give the site fresh capital to expand advertising and hire new employees.

As a public company, Airbnb could become a marquee name in the world of short-term travel accommodations.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia | A satellite image released by China on Saturday offered the latest sign that wreckage from a Malaysia Airlines plane lost for more than two weeks could be in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean where planes and ships have been searching for three days.



The image, showing an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet), was taken around noon Tuesday. The image location was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of where an Australian satellite viewed two objects two days earlier. The larger object was about as long as the one the Chinese satellite detected.



"The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify," Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday.



Australian officials said the location was within the 36,000-square-kilometer (14,000-square-mile) area they searched on Saturday, but the object was not found. Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman Andrea Hayward-Maher said she did not know whether the precise coordinates of the location had been searched, but added that coordinators will use the information to refine the search area.



The authority, which is overseeing the search in the region, said a civil aircraft reported seeing a number of small objects in the search area, including a wooden pallet, but a New Zealand military plane diverted to the location found only clumps of seaweed. The agency said in a statement that searchers would keep trying to determine whether the objects are related to the lost plane.



The latest satellite image is another clue in the baffling search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which dropped off air traffic control screens March 8 over the Gulf of Thailand with 239 people on board.



After about a week of confusion, Malaysian authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



The discovery of the two objects by the Australian satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to a stretch of the Indian Ocean about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Australia. But three days of searching have produced no confirmed signs of the plane.



One of the objects spotted in the earlier satellite imagery was described as 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). The Boeing 777-200 is about 64 meters (209 feet) long with a wingspan of 61 meters (199 feet) and a fuselage about 6.2 meters (20 feet) in diameter, according to Boeing's website.



In a statement on its website announcing China's find, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense did not explain why it took four days to release the information. But there was a similar delay in the release of the Australian satellite images because experts needed time to examine them.



Two military planes from China arrived Saturday in Perth to join Australian, New Zealand and U.S. aircraft in the search. Japanese planes will arrive Sunday and ships were in the area or on their way.



Even if both satellites detected the same object, it may be unrelated to the plane. One possibility is that it could have fallen off a cargo vessel.###5945||By Sharon Bernstein

SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) – Drought-plagued California will ease some protection for fish in the fragile San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, officials said Tuesday, a move expected to make more water available for farming and ease political tensions in an election year.

SPONSORED

The move marks a retreat from restrictions imposed earlier in the year which had widely been expected to be tightened further, rather than eased, and was welcomed in the agricultural community.

“California’s agriculture is critical to the world’s food supply,” said assemblywoman Kristin Olsen, who represents part of the San Joaquin Valley, who had lobbied hard against the restrictions. “An inability to produce that food would clearly be devastating to health and human safety not only in California but around the globe.”

Citing recent rains, regulators said Tuesday there was enough water in the state’s reservoirs now to partially ease restrictions.

“We were quite concerned at that time about the issue of public health and safety,” Tom Howard, executive director of the state Water Resources Control Board, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “This really had the markings of a historic drought.”

The move comes after weeks of intensive lobbying from growers, lawmakers from agricultural regions and the state’s two U.S. Senators, who said the restrictions, along with the possible curtailment of water rights for some agricultural and municipal customers, would harm the state’s economy.

The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of a drought that may still turn out to be one of the worst in its history despite storms that brought rain and snow last week, leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water and possibly forcing farmers to leave fallow a half-million acres of land.

Recent storms dropped nearly a foot of rain in some areas, boosting reservoir levels and the snowpack that the state relies on for drinking water in the spring, but still leaving supplies way below normal for this time of year.

Earlier this month, concern that the state was about to restrict water supplies to farmers even further swept through the agricultural community, spurring intensive pushback and a series of tense meetings with water regulators in the administration of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

“We are very concerned that if the current proposal as reported to us is enacted, it will have significant near- and long-term effects on the California economy and, more importantly, will not achieve the desired water supply security intended,” U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jim Costa and John Garamendi, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to the water board.

CUTBACKS STILL POSSIBLE

Under the new rules announced Tuesday, which Howard said may be modified again next month, the two massive public water projects responsible for pumping in the delta will be able to deliver it to farmers and others, once the state determines that there is enough flowing to meet the health and sanitation needs of residents.

Scott Shapiro, an attorney specializing in water issues for the Sacramento firm Downey Brand, said expanding the allowable uses of tight water supplies was not just important for farmers.

“It’s not just for agriculture, because there are other needs that may be contracted for that go beyond health and safety,” Shapiro said. “It could include other municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.

In addition to allowing more of the water pumped from the delta to be used for purposes other than meeting health and safety needs, the state planned to reduce by about a third the amount of water that the projects were required to leave in the delta as a way of protecting fish, Howard said during the press briefing.

But he cautioned that the state could still implement severe cutbacks to the water rights of many users if dry conditions continue.

Environmental groups, long critical of what they say is over-use of the state’s limited water resources for farming in dry areas, did not immediately respond to the rules change.

Mark Cowin, director water resources for the state, said that fish and wildlife experts consulted by his department said that endangered species in the delta would not be harmed by the looser rules.

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM###5949||Walmart Stores Inc. has confirmed it will allow customers to trade in used video games at it's over 3,100 stores for store credit.

The service will begin starting March 26, according to Reuters.

The service means Walmart will accept games for a number of consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360.

Customers who take part in a trade in will receive store credit, but not cash, at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online, the company said, according to Reuters.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement, according to Reuters.

Other retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, and Target also offer trade-in programs for used videogames as well.

All traded-in videogames will be refurbished before being made available for purchase to buyers, according to Walmart.

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," said Naughton.###5950||Empty###5951||LONDON: The euro fell against the dollar and pared its gains against the yen on Monday as some fretted that euro zone inflation data for February could be revised down in its final reading, keeping pressure on the European Central Bank to ease policy more.

The safe-haven yen slipped against the dollar as European stocks edged up on expectations the West will impose only limited sanctions on Russia after Ukraine's Crimea region voted in favour of annexation by Moscow.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a referendum to join Russia on Sunday, an outcome that was denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

While the risk of flare-ups in tension between Russia and Ukraine is underpinning demand for safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc, the market's immediate focus this morning is on final euro zone inflation data due at 1000 GMT.

A Reuters poll forecast no revision to the annual rate of 0.8 percent reported for February, but there is a risk it could be revised down, keeping alive concerns about disinflation in the euro zone.

“Our economists expect that the strong 0.8 percent which the flash estimate produced will be revised downwards to 0.7 percent,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank, Frankfurt.

“This combined with fears that the March result might be even lower is likely to keep alive speculation as to whether the ECB might cut rates once more after all.

The area around $1.3970 will have to constitute a natural barrier.

In the end the risk-reward-ratio is more attractive on the downside.”

The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3883, off a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 touched last Thursday, before European Central Bank President Mario Draghi knocked it lower when he voiced concerns about its strength.

Against the yen, the euro was flat at 140.98 yen off a session high of 141.34 yen struck in Asia.

It remained well shy of its March 7 high of 143.79 yen, which was its highest since Jan. 2.

<Center><b><i>Copyright Reuters, 2013</b></i><br></center>*###5952||Update - Citing a person "close to the board", the New York Times wrote that as well as the lack of pace of innovation at Symantec, the firing had much to do with recent departures at the company. The executive in charge of the cloud business, the CFO the Senior Vice President and the heads of both enterprise and consumer business at Symantec have left since Bennett's appointment. On top of that Symantec has failed to attract new talent as engineers are attracted instead to new competitors such as FireEye and Palo Alto networks as well as to security roles within other technology companies.

One thing that public markets really hate is ongoing executive churn within a company. So the news today that Symantec Corp has fired its president and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such move in less than two years, will cause real concern.

Symantec is well known for producing the Norton AntiVirus software, but it's fair to say that the move away from PCs, the increasing use of software subscription models and related lessening appetite for licence-based products alongside the rise of mobile applications have all created a very unstable marketplace for the company. While other companies have seen the mid-term horizon and managed to make some big changes (a good example being Dell which went private in order to have the freedom to embark on a new strategy built on the back of becoming a services-based business), Symantec has been less successful at navigating this path.

The company has been working through a reorganization plan to deal with weak earnings, but reorganization is different from reinvention and this is something that Symantec will come to realize. This is perhaps the rationale for the firing, said Chairman Daniel Schulman;

This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety

As a temporary measure, the company has named Michael Brown as interim president and CEO, effective immediately but, at the same time, has begun a search for a permanent replacement. Bennett joined the Symantec board in 2010 after stints at General Electric and Intuit. He took the CEO role in July 2012 after the board "requested" that Enrique Salem step down from the role.

As for the interim CEO, Brown joined the board following the merger with Veritas Software in 2005. Previously he served as both chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

I reached out to Symantec to see what the move means in light of the company's need to truly reimagine what it fundamentally does as a business. Symantec declined to comment and referred me to their press release which, unfortunately for the company, flags some turbulent waters to come, at least in terms of revenue.###5953||Empty###5954||Symantec Corp. Thursday fired its CEO, Steve Bennett, after less than two years on the job.

In-depth analysis News Writer Brandan Blevins reports that experts say Symantec's strategic problems root deeper than just its CEO.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based security vendor has appointed Michael Brown, a member of its board of directors, as its interim president and CEO. Bennett also stepped down from Symantec's board of directors.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future," said Symantec board chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement.

In searching for its next CEO, Schulman said the company's priority is to identify a leader who can leverage Symantec's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.

Bennett assumed the top job at Symantec in July 2012, shortly after the company's board removed its previous CEO, Enrique Salem.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process," said Schulman, "and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Just last week in an interview with CRN, Bennett detailed his plans for growing Big Yellow's market share in key information security product segments, emphasizing the so-called "Symantec 4.0" strategy that included new road maps for its information security, information management and mobility product lines.

However, many have questioned Symantec's strategy in recent years as enterprises have shifted away from endpoint security products, Symantec's core market, instead favoring a mix of emerging network security products.

The company is also facing a Justice Department investigation regarding whether its sales practices violated the U.S. False Claims Act. Symantec said efforts related to the investigation are likely to cost the company close to $150 million.

Symantec said it is convening a special committee of its board of directors to begin an immediate search for a permanent CEO, with assistance from an executive search firm.###5955||Symantec Corp`s sacked Chief Executive Stephen Bennett may get as much as $18.5 million in severance payment, based on his employment agreement.

Bennett is entitled to a severance payment if his services were terminated without cause within 12 months, according to a regulatory filing in August 2013.(http://r.reuters.com/myw77v)

His total compensation was $13 million for the fiscal year ended March 2013.

NEW YORK >> Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The worlds largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart and Sams Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

Gaming continues to be an important business for us and were actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity, said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.###5957||Empty###5958||In a seven-episode In Contrast podcast special “What’s Wrong with American Media?,” public intellectual and host of In Contrast Ilan Stavans and veteran journalist Ray Suarez look at Murrow’s message in the age of “fake news.”

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft.

Shares fell about 12% on Friday.



TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, said a lot of ipeople bought Symantec because it had a new CEO and was involved in online security. "How can you miss?" was the thinking, he said.

However, Symantec didn't "change with the times" and was focusing on personal computers rather than mobile.

Pointing to FireEye (FEYE), Cramer said that a stock can do very well in this industry when it delivers but when it offered 14 million shares in a secondary offering, FireEye shares suffered.

Cramer admitted he "fears" that when the insiders in Symantec start selling their shares, the stock will suffer. He also thinks this will happen to any company going public now.

"Insider selling is what wrecked 2000," Cramer concluded, and it can wreck these companies, too.

Walmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.

Walmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam’s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.

This move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Meanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop’s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn’t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true – overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.

GameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop’s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn’t intimidated by the new player.

"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. "There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product."

Mr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers’ loyalty.

Regardless, the markets haven’t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.###5975||Empty###5976||Empty###5977||Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing the credit cards of customers using Russian banks affected by the economic sanctions announced in Washington, the banks said today.

An affiliate bank, Sobinbank, which is 100%-controlled by Bank Rossiya, was also affected.

Bank Rossiya was hit by a fresh wave of Washington sanctions announced yesterday, which also targeted several billionaire businessmen believed to be close to Putin.

Clients of the banks are now unable to use their credit cards to make purchases or to withdraw money from cash machines not belonging to the banks.

SMP Bank, which is controlled by brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg who were among those blacklisted, also said its clients were unable to make Visa and MasterCard payments.

How business may ultimately shape the Ukraine crisis

US President Barack Obama yesterday said the list of Russians targeted by sanctions had been extended to include oligarchs and bankers believed to be close to Putin, including Gennady Timchenko and Yuri Kovalchuk.

Bank Rossiya was listed separately as a target for sanctions.

Americans and American businesses, such as Visa and MasterCard, are forbidden from any dealings with anyone targetted by the sanctions and any assets they might have in the US are frozen.

Putin responded today by vowing to open an account at Bank Rossiya on Monday.

SMP Bank said in a statement that it believed the move was "unlawful" because the sanctions targeted not the bank but its shareholders.

None of the banks affected have a major high-street presence, but Bank Rossiya is used by companies within Gazprom energy giant to pay salaries to staff, the Interfax news agency reported.

Russia's central bank said in a statement about Bank Rossiya that "the operations that come under sanctions are not having a significant impact on the financial stability of the credit organisation".

"If necessary suitable measures will be taken to support the credit organisation and give reliable protection of the interests of its account holders and creditors," Russia's central bank added.###5978||Get email alerts for local stories and events around the world.###5979||Empty###5980||Walmart Wants To Be The GameStop Where You Trade In Games For Groceries

According to the Wall Street Journal, Walmart will soon start buying used video games from shoppers at 3,100 locations. Of course, this being Walmart, you don’t get cash your old game, you get a Walmart gift card. The value of that card will be tied to the value of the game in question.

For Walmart, it’s a way to get a slice of the still-lucrative, $2 billion/year used game market at a time when an increasing number of game-buyers are getting their new games digitally, thus bypassing retailers like Walmart and Best Buy. Walmart also sees it as a way to let customers cash in on games they aren’t playing — and then spend that “found” money at Walmart.

“We win those market share battles because we’ve been at it a long time,” CEO Paul Raines tells the Journal, presumably while flipping through the help-wanted ads.

Walmart hopes that shoppers will choose it over existing competitors because you can’t trade in a copy of Borderlands 2 for a head of lettuce or a pair of sweatpants at GameStop.

From the Associated Press:

The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.

The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker’s disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.

“Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues … Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress,” Holder told a news conference.

Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, “we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust,” said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. “In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first.”

Toyota said it had “made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totaling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.

###5983||The Turkey Twitter ban has failed, with Turkish citizens apparently mobilized to send out even more tweets than before with the help of international communities.

In a related report by The Inquisitr, a Texas principal tried banning speaking Spanish on campus only to lose her job over the incident after an outcry from Hispanics.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the one who threatened the Turkey Twitter ban. The government censored the web domain for all internet users in the country, but that did not last very long at all. The Twitter company itself sent out messages reminding everyone how to use cell phone-based SMS text messaging to access Twitter. They also gave tips on alternative computer settings that could bypass Turkey’s blocks, which simply use redirects of the domain name so using an outside DNS server can help. Other private companies offered Twitter access in Turkey via Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and internet proxies services.

Philip Howard, head of the Digital Activism Research Project, claims that Turkey’s Twitter ban only caused the service to become more popular within the country:

“Trying to ban Twitter has backfired. It’s drawn the world’s attention to the country’s increasingly tough censorship and surveillance strategy. News of the ban seems to have driven more Turks to try Twitter out for the first time, breaking national records for Twitter use. Tip sheets for getting around the ban spread like wildfire.”

Instead of deterring people, the Turkey Twitter ban actually emboldened people and the number of Tweets out of Turkey increased to record levels. It’s claimed by some that practically the only people who are not using Twitter in Turkey now are pro-government supporters. It’s estimated by some survey that almost 15 percent of the Turkish population is now using Twitter.

But why was Turkey’s Twitter ban implemented in the first place? Some reports claim Prime Minister Erdogan targeted the social media platform because Turkish users were using it to spread news and videos showcasing the corruption of the Turkish government.

David Kramer, president of the pro-democracy group Freedom House, claims that a truly democratic nation should not be afraid of Twitter:

“The decision to block Twitter, a leading medium of communication in Turkey, is quite a dramatic step for a government that claims to be democratic. It is a bold attempt to stop news of government corruption from getting out in the run-up to local elections. The government should immediately reopen Twitter and recognize that free, unhindered space for debate is essential in Turkey, as it is anywhere else.”

Turkey’s Twitter ban is not the first time they’ve attempted internet censorship. The government tried the same thing with YouTube only to have technically savvy Turkish people bypass their efforts. Twitter is also banned in China but many Chinese still use the social media service regardless of their government’s censorship.###5984||Walmart Wants To Be The GameStop Where You Trade In Games For Groceries

“We win those market share battles because we’ve been at it a long time,” CEO Paul Raines tells the Journal, presumably while flipping through the help-wanted ads.

Walmart hopes that shoppers will choose it over existing competitors because you can’t trade in a copy of Borderlands 2 for a head of lettuce or a pair of sweatpants at GameStop.

Raines cautioned that big retailers might not understand the logistical nightmare they face when jumping into the used game business, saying, “there are lots and lots of risks when you’re buying a preowned product.”###5985||Share.

Starting March 26, gamers will be able to trade in used games at Walmart which will in turn begin being sold to the public later this year.

The process is simple: bring in your used game, with its original packaging, to the electronics department of any of the 3,100 Walmart stores across the United States. An associate will scan your game and give it a once-over to determine its value before providing you with a credit voucher that can be used in any Walmart or Sam's Club both in store and online. Your trade-in will then be refurbished and sold as a used title beginning "later this year."

Unlike GameStop, however, Walmart will not offer the option of receiving cash for game trade-ins, nor will it accept video game hardware.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a press release. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

Walmart has tested the used game market in the past; it previously had a small, kiosk-based game trading system located in some of it stores.

RFE/RL takes a look at some basics of the art of sanctioning.



Who has the authority to impose sanctions?



Russia insists that unilateral sanctions violate international law.



"Unilateral sanctions have never brought about anything good. They are illegitimate and have no international legal basis," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on March 20 to the Russian Duma.



"The [UN] Security Council is the only body that can make decisions about coercive measures toward sovereign states. No such decision has been made by it regarding the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian leadership represented by [ousted Ukrainian] President [Viktor] Yanukovych."



At the same time, Russia has repeatedly imposed trade barriers and restrictions on many countries, particularly ones like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia that have pursued aggressive European-integration policies.



What role does the World Trade Organization (WTO) play?



Russia joined the WTO in 2012, and the United States and all EU member states are also members. The EU itself is also a member of the WTO.



Although the WTO is intended to facilitate international trade, its rules, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), include provisions that enable countries to establish trade restrictions for "national security reasons."



"Under Article 21 of the GATT, there is an exception for national-security reasons. This is generally been interpreted as the provision under which any economic sanctions would fall," says Stephen Woolcock, an associate professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.



Russia could, however, challenge any sanctions through WTO dispute-settlement mechanisms. And, theoretically, the WTO could overturn sanctions that were determined to be in violation of GATT rules.



Such a turn of events is considered highly unlikely as long as sanctions remain at the level of targeted measures against individuals. If the West moves to broader sanctions aimed at the Russian economy, which U.S. President Barack Obama has said could happen, Russia might have more grounds to seek redress.



But Woolcock notes that sanctions have been imposed against WTO members in the past and none has been successfully challenged within the organization.



The WTO has no mechanism for sanctioning members or expelling them. Some countries have left of their own accord, however.



Some analysts have argued that the WTO could also be used to punish Moscow, as members could file complaints against Russia for some of its controversial trade practices. In July, for instance, the EU announced it would challenge a Russian law that imposes a fee on foreign car producers for scrapping used vehicles in Russia.



Do the sanctions extend to the family members of targeted individuals?



Not automatically, says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the London-based Center for European Reform and a veteran British diplomat. "They won't automatically extend to relatives, but they will, for example, extend to shell companies where the EU or the U.S. can identify that the controlling interest is held by a person who is subject to sanctions," he says.



It has been reported, for instance, that Russian oil trader Gennady Timchenko sold his stake in Swiss-based Gunvor to his business partner on the eve of the announcement of sanctions against him. Bond says financial authorities will certainly investigate that alleged sale and could rule that Timchenko continues to benefit from Gunvor's assets.



If EU or U.S. financial authorities can prove that a relative is merely holding assets that benefit a sanctioned individual, those assets could also be targeted.



Expanding the targeted sanctions to family members could be done as an additional measure of targeted sanctions before the West moves to broader sanctions against the Russian economy.



Why hasn't Russian President Vladimir Putin been sanctioned?



Sanctions against a sitting head of state are extremely rare and are generally reserved only for rulers that Western countries would like to see removed, such as Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe or the former ruling military junta in Burma.



Ian Bond says doing so is the "nuclear option" of targeted sanctions. "And I guess that everybody is trying not to go for steps that are really at the top of the list of things that could be done," he adds. "There is still a lot more that could go wrong, a lot more ways in which Russia could interfere in Ukraine and make the situation worse."



What about possible sanctions against Russian state journalists and publicists such as Sergei Markov or Aleksandr Dugin, who have been actively justifying Russia's intervention in Ukraine?



Bond says sanctions could be imposed upon such people if the West determines they are actively promoting violence or disseminating hate speech. It is, however, an issue on which Europe and the United States might not be able to agree.



"I realize that is very difficult territory particularly for the U.S. because of its very strong attachment to the First Amendment" of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech," Bond says. "It is in some ways less of an issue for Europeans because certainly in countries like Germany, for very good historical reasons, they have pretty strong laws on how far you are allowed to go."



The latest round of EU sanctions includes Dmitry Kiselyov, the head of the Russian state news agency Rossia Segodnya. The EU document describes Kiselyov as a "central figure of the government propaganda machine supporting the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine."

BAC: -0.73%

WFC: -0.02%

C: -0.24%

USB: flat

Financial shares were lower in Friday's pre-market session, weighed by bank stocks, which edged slightly lower, even as the latest round of annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve released late Thursday showed 29 of the 30 largest banks have enough capital to withstand a severe economic downturn.

The only one of the 30 largest banks that didn't meet the Fed's minimum capital standards was Zions Bancorp ( ZION ), which had a Tier 1 common capital ratio under the stress test of 3.5%, below the Fed's minimum threshold of 5%.

Late Thursday, Zions said it will resubmit its capital plan to the Fed and anticipates the resubmission will contain additional actions that will further reduce risk and/or increase its common equity capital sufficient to pass the stress test.

ZION shares were down about 1.3% in pre-market trade Thursday.

In other financial stocks news, Western Asset Mortgage Capital ( WMC ) was 1.5% lower after it reported Q4 net income of $20.8 million, or $0.83 per share, compared with $24.82 million or $1.04 per share in the same period last year.

Core earnings (a non-GAAP measure) were $17.2 million, or $0.70 per share, compared with the prior-year period's $22.96 million, or $0.96 per share.

Analysts polled by Capital IQ were expecting non-GAAP EPS of $0.75.###5989||Empty###5990||Right Opinion Deflating Russia Can Be Done

President Obama has ramped up his second round of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, and on Vladimir Putin in particular. Some of this is already working. But if anybody believes it will be easy to financially deflate Russia, they better think again.

Russia holds $132 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. That’s a big number, and it could be sold in the event of financial warfare. That won’t kill the United States. But it will undoubtedly cause interest rates to rise.

Would Putin spend it all? Who knows? His central bank just spent $50 billion to defend a sinking ruble, which is off about 10 percent year to date. But that still leaves about $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that could be called upon to defend the Russian homeland in an emergency.

But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin’s personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won’t do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)

Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPO’s have been sold there. So if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?

Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits such as Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia’s finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

And then there’s Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S. and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.

The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It’s a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia’s stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.

Of course, there are other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for liquefied natural gas terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it – deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That’s how difficult this job is going to be.

* Launch of new models, higher production to drive sales

* Shares up 6.8 pct, biggest gainer on pan-European index (Removes extraneous text from headline)

By Edward Taylor

MUNICH, March 19 (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker BMW is looking at raising production capacity at its plant in the United States and releasing 12 new models as it chases record sales and a rise in pretax profit of up to 10 percent this year.

BMW’s plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is being readied to reach an annual production capacity of around 350,000 vehicles, up from 300,000 at the end of 2013. It makes sport utility vehicles including the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models.

“The U.S. will stay a market with great potential for us. This is why we are evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity in the U.S.”, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company’s annual results press conference on Wednesday.

Analysts welcomed the outlook from the Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands.

“We see BMW’s confidence as a major positive trigger for the stock,” analysts at ISI Global said in a note to clients.

BMW shares were up 6.8 percent at 86.207 euros at 1301 GMT, the biggest gainers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .

Reithofer declined to give a figure about future production levels at Spartanburg, or comment on whether BMW is thinking about producing a new model, the X7. The carmaker said it will make a further announcement about its U.S. plans on March 28.

Investments made at plants in China will allow BMW to raise production capacity there to 400,000 cars, from 300,000 in 2013.

BMW reiterated its aim to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014 to 2 million or more, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

“We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions,” Reithofer said.

Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner later said a “significant rise” meant “somewhere in the range of a high single-digit and a double-digit amount.”

Last week, BMW reported its automotive division’s fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

The forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable and on a steady recovery in European markets, BMW said.

BMW expects significant growth in markets outside Europe including high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in China.

The car maker said it expected sales in the second half of 2014 to be higher than in the first six months as a result of a large number of model launches, including the compact 2-series coupe and the 2-series Active Tourer.

BMW is also launching the i8, a diesel hybrid sportscar made of carbon fiber, later this year with a starting price of around 126,000 euros.

BMW board member for sales and marketing Ian Robertson said the i8 will have an initial production run of 1,000 vehicles.

BMW will make greater use of carbon fiber in other models from its vehicle range, and is developing the next generation Z4 roadster together with Toyota Motor Corp., Robertson said.

Separately, BMW published it annual report, which showed that CEO Reithofer received total compensation of 7.03 million euros in 2013, a 6 percent increase on the previous year.

So far, Bank Rossiya is the only company to be named in the US sanctions list, described by Washington as 'the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation'.

Visa and MasterCard have suspended payment processing services to its clients while Russia's central bank has countered that, if needs be, it will take appropriate measures to protect the interests of Bank Rossiya's depositors and creditors.

Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, part owned by Gennady Timchenko, one of Russia's leading businesmen, today fell by 8 per cent. Gunvor, the fourth-largest oil trader co-founded by Timchenko, is also at the centre of a debate about whether Putin, who is an investor, could commandeer its funds.

The sanctions prompted companies with links to Russia and Ukraine to take hasty action to protect themselves from sanctions particularly regarding their contractual entitlement to suspend their contracts.

Yet despite these dramatic troubles, big investment banks are playing down the impact of a new cold war on the medium-term economy. Hakan Enoksson, head of fixed interest at RBC Wealth Management, told Interactive Investor that the wealth manager's essential view on the economic outlook for European countries had not changed, although the firm has sold out of major Russian corporates such as state-owned energy company Gazprom, which is still at the centre of intense negotiations about the $2 billion (£1.2 billion) owed to it by Kiev.

Barclays also issued a report today which identified a hard landing in China as the biggest risk to derail the global recovery, and largely limits its concern about Russia's oil output, coming at a time when key producers in the Middle East and Africa face serious political and security challenges that are imperilling output.

Fears not unfounded

On China, it said: 'Such fears are not entirely unfounded in the medium term, as it will be very difficult for authorities to restructure the economy toward a more sustainable growth model and enact needed market reforms while at the same time maintaining strong growth and avoiding accidents such as the bursting of a property bubble.

'But so far Chinese policymakers have demonstrated a willingness to put aside their medium-term restructuring goals and employ policy tools such as easier credit and infrastructure spending to avoid any sharp slowdown from becoming sustained.

'Indeed, these measures are already being employed, suggesting to us that the next move in Chinese growth is up.'

On Russia, Barclays notes that while there has been no cut-off of Russian energy supplies through the Ukraine pipeline network to date, such a course of action cannot be ruled out if the crisis escalates, and that the crisis will also jeopardize much-needed long-term Western investment in the Russian energy sector. It will also impact the scope of the nuclear capabilities that Iran will be allowed to retain permanently.

Equity and fixed-income balance

Otherwise, the research highlights the benign 'environment of low inflation, modest growth and very supportive monetary policy [which] is likely to persist over the next several months', adding that with few credible alternatives in fixed income, 'it would be tempting for investors to overload their portfolios with stocks'.

Instead the bank recommends a balance between equities and fixed income on the basis that bonds will be an effective hedge to stockmarket correction.

'We have not seen a bona fide correction for nearly two years and investors have become optimistic, lowering the bar for disappointment,' it said.

'More broadly, stockmarkets have been going up in developed markets even as medium-term growth prospects have been falling due to structural factors such as slower growth in working age populations and higher dependency ratios.

'Unusually supportive monetary policy seems to be boosting financial asset prices more than economic growth, providing a reason to maintain strong positions in stocks in the near term, but hardly comforting in the medium term.'

Sarasin & Partners amongst others have suggested that a bigger risk to the global economy is the Japanese/Chinese row and posturing over five small islands in the Pacific Ocean, known as the Senkaku Islands by the Japanese and the Diaoyu Islands by the Chinese.

The state-run Anatolia news agency said authorities “technically blocked access to Twitter” late Thursday because the service had ignored various Turkish court orders to remove some links deemed illegal.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content. “Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.

Twitter, mwitter! We will wipe out all of these. This has nothing to do with freedoms

RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN

Twitter responded by saying on its official policy feed that Turks could get around the block by tweeting through mobile telephone text services.

In early reaction, the EU commissioner for digital agenda, Neelie Kroes, tweeted that the block in Turkey “is groundless, pointless, cowardly”. She added that the “Turkish people and international community will see this as censorship. It is.”

The restriction of access to Twitter came after Erdogan told a rally drumming up support for March 30 local elections that he would eradicate Twitter access in the country.

“We will wipe out Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says,” he said.

Erdogan’s office said in a statement that Twitter had remained “indifferent” to Turkish court rulings demanding “some links” be removed, and that the premier therefore had turned his attention to the matter.

The website for the country’s telecommunications authority (TIB) turned up four separate court rulings referencing “twitter.com”. One of them said: “The protection measure has been taken for this website (twitter.com) according to the decision ... of the Istanbul chief public prosecutor’s office and has been implemented by the TIB.”

Anatolia ran a report saying a Twitter block was the only solution to “address the unjust treatment of our citizens”.

Erdogan, Turkey’s charismatic and increasingly autocratic leader since 2003, has come under mounting pressure since audio recordings spread across social media that appeared to put him at the heart of a major corruption scandal.

Recordings include an apparent discussion between Erdogan and his son about hiding money, as well as and others in which he seems to be interfering in business deals, court cases and the media’s coverage.

Some of the most damaging information has come from a Twitter account, under the name Haramzadeler (“Sons of Thieves”), which appears to have access to a huge trove of secret documents and police wiretaps linked to the investigation.

Erdogan has dismissed most of the recordings as “vile” fakes concocted by his rivals, and threatened to ban YouTube and Facebook after crucial local elections on March 30. “Twitter, mwitter!,” Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.

“We will wipe out all of these. This has nothing to do with freedoms. Freedom does not mean the right to intrude on someone’s privacy, or to pass the state’s secrets to the international arena.”

The prime minister is openly suspicious of the internet and last year called Twitter a “menace” for helping organise mass anti-government protests.

A vast corruption inquiry launched in December saw dozens of people rounded up, including close business and political allies of the prime minister.

The Turkish strongman has accused associates of a former staunch ally – US-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States – of being behind the graft probe that claimed the scalps of four ministers. Gulen has denied any involvement in the matter.

Turkey recently tightened government control of the internet and the judiciary, generating criticism from rights groups.

The country, which has more than 10 million Twitter users, has seen access to thousands of sites blocked in recent years. YouTube was banned for two years up to 2010 because of material deemed insulting to the country’s revered founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

The Internet Publishers Association, a body representing online and media companies, said the move to block Twitter was an attempt to “destroy freedom of expression”.###6002||Empty###6003||Tech Trader

NEW YORK – Walmart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept an unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age.

Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted.

The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, Duncan Mac Naughton said, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade-in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives.

Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.###6008||Empty###6009||Empty###6010||Empty###6011||Empty###6012||Empty###6013||Indiana's Unemployment Rate Drops To 6.4 Percent

The state's jobless rate has been dropping since last summer after having been stuck around 8 percent for more than a year.

Indiana's unemployment rate is now below the national rate of 6.6 percent. The new report shows about 210,000 people were looking for jobs in Indiana during January.

Copyright Associated Press###6015||###6016||Oracle reports its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and analysts have hopes for a good quarter.

They are expecting 4% growth in revenue over the year-ago quarter, and EPS to be $0.70, up from $0.65.

If the company exceeds these targets, it will be a two-in-a-row beat.

Oracle could really use that. It missed revenue expectations for the prior three quarters in a row, an almost unheard of series of misses for the company as it struggled to stop its hardware business from shrinking.

With revenue soft, Oracle spent most of 2013 in cost-cutting mode. That meant that many Oracle employees didn't get their bonuses, Wall analyst analyst Steve Koenig, of Wedbush said in a research note published last week:

"Our checks suggest FY13 bonuses were trimmed or eliminated for many employees across the company , which augurs wells for cost control, but not so much for ORCL's ability to attract and retain talent."

Koenig clarified to Business Insider, "It's anecdotal, but we heard from more employees that they are not getting their fiscal '13 bonuses, which ended [last] May. And it seems that that sort of thing is more frequent than it has been in the past. [This affects] people in marketing, internal development, etc."

The company has been beefing up its revenue numbers with cloud acquisitions. However Koenig says that once those acquisitions get absorbed, Oracle hasn't been making much hay with them.

"Some of the SaaS acquisitions they've done don't look they are generating a whole lot of growth. I've heard that RightNow is doing really well, but I conclude that Taleo is probably not growing well," he says. Oracle bought customer service cloud RightNow for $1.5 billion in 2011 and bought human resource cloud Taleo for $1.9 billion in 2012.

He says that if you strip out the revenue from whatever cloud acquisition Oracle has most recently completed, "cloud revenue out stays flat."

Still, Koenig isn't panning the stock altogether. He maintains a "neutral" rating and target price of $40. The stock is trading at about $38 now.

He thinks Oracle is going to beat consensus expectations tomorrow, and that it's doing an especially good job in selling its the latest version of its bread-and-butter product, the database. Oracle released a new version of its database, 12c, last summer. 12c is designed for cloud computing applications, an area where enterprises are investing heavily.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 (UPI) -- In its latest round of fundraising, Airbnb could attract up to $400 million in funds, valuing the startup at more than $10 billion.

Leading the pack of investors is TPG, which has already taken on many other Silicon Valley startups like Uber. If Airbnb manages to raise between $400 and $500 million, it will make them one of the most valuable startups in the world. In hits last fundraising round, Airbnb raised cash based on a $2.5 billion valuation.

There has been a lot buzz generated among technology companies, especially startups, following the $19 billion purchase of messaging app WhatsApp by Facebook. Facebook itself was one of the most popular startups in the technology segment, now valued at around $72 billion.

Airbnb helps connect travelers with people interested in renting out their homes or even a room for a fee, with the company collecting a portion of the fee. The company is also under scrutiny from regulators who are looking at whether the company's services is depriving states of taxes.

[New York Times] [CNET]###6019||Empty###6020||Bruno Guillon has stepped down as chief executive of luxury handbag maker Mulberry ( ) with immediate effect.

Guillon has led the AIM-listed company since March 2012 when he took over from Godfrey Davis, who then became non-executive chairman.

Davis will take up the role of executive chairman until a successor is found.

It follows falling sales and a profit warning at the end of January.

British shoppers crossed Alexa satchels off their Christmas wish lists despite heavy discounts, while Korea is also proving a more difficult market to crack than expected.

“I, along with the Board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” said Davis.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

The shares rose 2% to 648.5p.

Ankara has found the internet difficult to silence over allegations of corruption. Hours after Turkey’s government moved to block access to Twitter, Turkish citizens struck back – on the social media network itself.

Some circulated a manipulated picture of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, sinking his teeth into the blue bird that serves as the network’s mascot. They were not alone: the number of tweets sent after the midnight ban rose 140 per cent over normal levels, according to data provided by analytics firm Brandwatch.



Dodging the ban

Twitter sent out mobile numbers that allowed Turkish consumers to keep using its service. In another technical fix against the ban, Turkish downloads of Hotspot Shield, the world’s most popular virtual private network service, rose to 270,000 on Friday – from a daily average of 7,000.

The Turkish users’ defiance and the sheer scale of their activity suggest no immediate end to the battering Mr Erdogan has suffered in cyberspace.

Seeking to silence allegations of corruption against him and his government in the run-up to local elections on March 30th, he has removed some 7,000 policemen from their posts and boosted Ankara’s powers over judges and prosecutors.

But the internet has proved harder to handle. A formal corruption investigation has stalled, Twitter and YouTube have been used to circulate apparently incriminating voice recordings of Mr Erdogan and his circle – including some he has acknowledged as authentic.

Yet more explosive leaks are expected ahead of this month’s elections – according to one rumour, more revelations will come on March 25th.

But if Turkey’s Twitter ban was intended to thwart the dissemination of such allegations, it has backfired spectacularly.

“Erdogan is constantly on the run now. I don’t think he has time to think,” said Soli Ozel at Kadir Has university in Istanbul. “He is trying to keep the scandal as muted as possible at all costs, but he can’t control the technology. Instead, he is fuelling the fire of suspicion and making everyone anticipate what, if anything, will come out on the 25th.”

Mr Erdogan took aim at Twitter, saying he would “root out” the microblogging service for national security reasons. But he failed to account for Turkey’s predilection for social networks – a response, many say, to a cowed media – which means Twitter has greater penetration among web users here than in any other country.

Even President Abdullah Gul, who signed a Bill increasing government control over the internet, tweeted his opposition to the measure.



Free speech

Before long, the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the UK government, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and many other non-governmental and international bodies had sent tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech. Celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Richard Branson, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood piled in.

The Turkish bar association filed a criminal complaint against the ban, which it said was illegal. As sporadic Twitter service returned, mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure, supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy.

The government says it was done as Twitter had failed to respect such court complaints; a lawyer for Twitter was in Ankara for meetings yesterday.

“These steps are very crucial for the Turkish legal system,” said Selin Erciyas, at Mehmet Gun & Partners, an Istanbul law firm. “We will see if there is a true objective legal system or whether it is just Erdogan that decides things in court.”

Army Col. Steven Warren said the Elrod assumed escort duties Wednesday, two days after a team of U.S. Navy SEALS seized control of the commercial tanker from three armed Libyan hijackers.

The escort change was for administrative reasons: The Stout is assigned to the U.S. European Command area, and the Elrod is assigned to U.S. Africa Command, Warren said.

About 25 members of the Stout's crew who had been aboard the Morning Glory to provide security, navigation and communications assistance have been replaced by about 34 sailors from the Elrod, according to Warren. The Elrod and Morning Glory are expected to reach international waters just outside Libya this weekend, where the Morning Glory will be turned over to Libyan authorities, Warren said.

The Morning Glory, hijacked from the port of As-Sidra, is carrying oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. Libya and Cyprus had requested assistance from the U.S. government in regaining control of the ship. The SEALS embarked from the USS Roosevelt, which is deployed in the Mediterranean as part of the George H.W. Bush carrier strike group.

No one was hurt in the SEAL operation, Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a news release earlier this week.

Now the software which is used to drive Bitcoin transactions has been modified to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen again.

The new Bitcoin Core software has five significant changes to prevent future attacks on the currency, like the one that happened at Mt.Gox, you can see more details below.

“If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version.”

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals###6026||In the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Laura Kusisto, Eliot Brown and Andrew Tangel kick off a report on the challenges facing New York City’s rent-a-bike program with this gripping lead:

Leaders of Citi Bike are moving quickly to raise tens of millions of dollars to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money, according to people familiar with the matter.

Striking, but given the evidence in the rest of the piece, it has the air of a premature eulogy. Consider how the 10-month-old system has 100,000 annual members. Then there’s the truly terrible winter New York has experienced — Brooklyn data engineer Abe Stanway has proven that Citi Bike weather is indeed a thing — and the fact that the system at rollout had design flaws that seemed almost intended to make sure no one, in the early going, developed a habit of riding Citi Bike.

In other words, the Venn diagram overlap between “Citi Bike works” and “it’s not crazy to ride Citi Bike in this weather” has been awfully small.

For one thing, there was the botched software and hardware that made engaging with Citi Bike in the spring and summer enormously painful. In those days, it wasn’t unusual to try five different bike stations before finding one capable of producing a working bike. The slot for putting your blue key fob in was hidden like an Easter egg, and the software interface built by troubled Montreal-based operating company Bixi was terrible (and still isn’t terrific). Those design flaws caused several cities to withhold payment, and may have limited the capacity of the operating companies to improve the system.

Casual daily or weekly Citi Bike users had their own issues. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reports that while the number individual subscribers paying $95 a year has crept upward in the winter months, the number of short-term passes designed to appeal to tourists has dropped considerably.

Again, there’s the weather. But the system also hasn’t been optimized for use by tourists. Short-term passes work like this: The kiosk spits out a paper slip with a code that you carry over to the bike rack, which may or may not then release a bike. The process introduces tourists to an experience that many visitors to New York are eager to avoid: Standing in the middle of a sidewalk looking intensely foolish.

Perhaps the most enduring challenge for Citi Bike is where the Journal writes: “Finding additional sponsors has proved challenging because the program has become so closely associated with its eponymous supporter, according to a person familiar with the matter.”

“Closely associated” is an understatement. The Bloomberg administration went all in on mono-corporate sponsorship of its bike share program. The bikes are Citibank blue and branded with the company name on nearly every surface. MasterCard is also a Citi Bike sponsor, in particular for the payment system, but finding anyone who has ever referred to “Citi Bikes with the additional sponsorship of MasterCard” is probably next to impossible. That reality is no doubt discouraging to other would-be partners. It’s hard to say what the fix is, short of scrapping the program’s identity altogether.

We’re approaching the time when Citi Bike’s early adopters will decide whether to re-up their memberships, and that renewal rate will be telling. The system works better now and New York’s weather will soon hit its gorgeous phase. That seems a far truer test of the system’s prospects than these first 10 months have been.###6027||Submit
