1||Investing.com -Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from tightening monetary policy last week.
Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.
The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.
A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed in February, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

However, Heil says he is not a fan of three-cylinder engines on their own due to their increased noise, vibration and harshness levels.
Rather than balancing shafts and introducing a handful of other measures which could drive up costs, Heil believes the best option would be to pair the the three-cylinder engine to an electric motor.

"As long as the two sides respect each other and engage in proper consultations, problems can be solved," Li said, citing last year's trade dispute case of photovoltaic products as a successful example.Trade disputes are individual cases and account for a small percentage in the two-way trade, he added.Both China and EU are strong advocators of multipolar world and greater investment facilitation, so it is an irresistible trend that companies from the two sides enter each other's market and invest mutually, he said.Li expected that China and EU can carry on the negotiation of an investment treaty in a fair, reciprocal and facilitating way, so that there will be greater mutual investment and deeper economic integration between the two sides.Speaking of the export to EU, Li promoted China's equipment industry at the press conference, saying that Chinese companies can deliver the equipment for building high-speed railways and nuclear plants in the fastest way and at the minimum cost.China is upgrading its economy, including the export, he said.

A Wall Street Journal consensus estimate had pegged industrial production to expand at 9.5 percent and retail sales to grow at 13.5 percent.
Analysts at Societe Generale attributed the fall in retail sales to “anti-corruption drive and disinflation” while pinning the slowing of industrial production on rising inventories, according to MarketWatch.

The new dotcom fever, together with buoyant stock markets, have boosted King's valuation by $2bn in less than a month.
Analysts had valued King at $5.5bn in February, but the company said on Wednesday its shares would be priced at between $21 and $24 each.
The King pricing came as retailers Pets at Home and Poundland also debuted on the stock market.
New data shows that in February, 144 million people were active daily players of King games, reorganising brightly coloured sweets in Candy Crush, bursting their way through levels in Bubble Witch and sorting fruit in Farm Heroes.###174||Empty###175||Empty###176||Close Get email notifications on Tanasia Curtis daily!

But Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the risk of a financial crisis in China remains slim.
“A big concern in the markets in recent months is that defaults in the Chinese bond market could be an early signal of a much bigger financial crisis,” he said.
The latter part is especially important, because the Chinese government has formidable ammunition to fend off a financial crisis, including the largest foreign reserves in the world.

China&39;s Central Bank said that beginning on Monday, the daily trading band would double to 2 per cent on either side of a government-regulated parity rate, which could result in wider price fluctuations.
The move is widely understood as an attempt to lower the serious risk of a downturn in China.
The government has stepped up plans to liberalize interest rates and to reform the financial system.
Despite the moves towards liberalisation, the Chinese government still has the power to set the daily parity rate, allowing it to prevent big swings in the value of the renminbi.###190||Empty###191||Why did this happen?

Futures were likely to find support at $1,320.10 a troy ounce, the low from Feb. 28, and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.
Strong U.S. employment numbers and weak Chinese trade figures strengthened the dollar and capped gold's gains, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another.
Weak Chinese trade data supported the greenback as well by bolstering its appeal as a safe-haven asset class.

The widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March.
Traders suspected that the central bank, working through state banks, pushed the currency down to try to force those speculating on appreciation to unwind their positions.
The idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened.###370||Prices took support, however, from tensions in Ukraine, where concerns over Russia's intervention in Crimea have kept investors on edge.

This means that no matter how cheap and plentiful natural gas becomes, its pathway to our vehicles is blocked.

Editor’s Note:250% Gains Bagged Using Secret Calendar (See Video)The Fed meeting, and Yellen’s press conference at its conclusion, is the highlight of a relatively light week on the global economic calendar.
In the U.K., a midweek report is forecast to show the unemployment rate held at 7.2 percent.
The data are due Wednesday, the same time the BOE publishes the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s meeting earlier this month.
It will leave the benchmark interest rate at zero and maintain its cap on the franc, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.###522||But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates.
One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health.
Nor is it likely this year to raise the benchmark short-term rate it controls.
More than five years ago, the Fed cut that rate to a record low near zero, where it's remained since.
Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until late 2015.###523||Advanced SearchKeywordSearch by CHANNEL SECTOR MARKET AUTHOR###524||Gold rises for 2nd consecutive sessionGold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose for the second consecutive session Tuesday.

Among the biggest obstacles to the planned relocation of several hundred million rural residents is the huge infrastructure development needed to accommodate the new wave of city dwellers as well as reform of the country's "hukou" registration system.
This complex system of residency registration is a major sticking point because it controls the benefits that residents can enjoy.

The fees would have funded police officers and sidewalk repairs, he said.
“As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen in the city of Los Angeles,” according to a company statement.
“We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit.
Time Warner has refused to pay $9.7 million in franchise and other fees owed from 2008 until 2011, despite attempts to resolve the dispute “amicably,” Feuer said.###943||Thank you for Reading!

"Movie and TV content is expected to account for around 70 percent of our business in 2014," ChinaVision Chairman Dong Ping said, who has been in the movie industry for 18 years and has invested in many popular movies such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Dong said the remaining 30 percent includes print media, advertising and some other businesses, but the company's presence in this part is also declining.The company halted most of its newspaper, mobile gaming and mobile video business in 2013, which Dong noted were not his "fields of expertise" and that ChinaVision will focus on providing content.ChinaVision has gotten a great deal of attention recently after Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in it.
