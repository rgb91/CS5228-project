Investing.com - Consumer price inflation in the U.S. rose in line with expectations in February, while prices excluding food and energy costs also inched up modestly, official data showed on Tuesday.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said that consumer prices rose by as a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, matching forecasts, after rising 0.1% in January.

Year-over-year, consumer prices rose at an annualized rate of 1.1% in February, below expectations for 1.2% and down from 1.6% in January.

Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, meeting estimates. Core consumer prices rose 0.1% in January.

Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 1.6% in February, unchanged from January and in line with expectations.

Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

Following the release of the data, the U.S. dollar held on to losses against the euro, with rising 0.04% to trade at 1.3928.

Meanwhile, U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a gain of 0.25%, S&P 500 futures indicated a rise of 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures signaled an increase of 0.2%.###3017||Empty###3018||Doh! 404!

CHINESE e-commerce giant Alibaba said yesterday that it has decided to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in the US, ending months of speculation that the firm would try to list in Hong Kong.The flotation could be the biggest since Facebook in 2012, with analysts estimating that Alibaba has a value of at least $140bn (£84bn), and that its IPO proceeds could exceed $15bn.Alibaba has not yet confirmed whether it will list on the Nasdaq or follow the swathes of tech stocks, such as Twitter and King, that have chosen the New York Stock Exchange in recent months.Meanwhile Twitter-like Chinese messaging service Weibo also filed on Friday to raise $500m from the US market, in an initial public offering that analysts expect will value the company at around $5.1bn.American markets are expected to see more IPOs from Chinese corporations in 2014 than in any year since 2010. The snubs to both Hong Kong and London come as a survey claimed the capital has lost its crown as the world’s leading financial centre.London slipped from the top of the global rankings, scoring 784 against 786 for New York, according to the Global Financial Centres Index compiled by London-based consultancy Z/Yen.“This seems to be based on a number of factors including... uncertainty over Europe, the perception that London might be becoming less welcoming to foreigners and perceived levels of market manipulation,” said Z/Yen associate director Mark Yeandle.###3022||Bitcoin was a dream come true for computer geeks, libertarians and big government paranoids.

Just imagine a digital currency untethered from government regulators, existing only in the virtual world of computer code and cheaper to use than credit cards.

But the recent collapse of a leading bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, has raised concerns about the legitimacy of this virtual currency.

A $470 million digital heist last month at the Tokyo-based exchange pushed the company into bankruptcy and left many bitcoin investors empty-handed with little recourse.

Mt. Gox chief executive Mark Karpeles offered some hollow condolences during a late February press conference in Tokyo. He basically said, oops, there was a bug in the bitcoin software, which allowed thieves to hack their way into the system and fraudulently withdraw bitcoin.

And to think this was supposedly the precursor to a digital Utopia.

Investors in traditional currencies — U.S. dollar, Japanese yen or Swiss franc — need a cast iron stomach, a savvy trading strategy and a fat wallet because big losses are inevitable.

Breaking news in these markets is like waving a biscuit at a mad dog. It comes fast, and it ain’t pretty.

But at least sovereign governments and regulatory authorities stand behind and monitor traditional currencies. While Bitcoin’s exchange rate is even more volatile than traditional currencies, there is no oversight from the FDIC, Federal Reserve or U.S. Treasury.

Tyler Moore, an SMU assistant professor in computer science and engineering, said he doesn’t believe the Mt. Gox fiasco will spell the demise of bitcoin, but regulatory safeguards are needed. Moore co-authored a research report last year in which he examined the risks of investing in bitcoin.

“The bitcoin ecosystem is in need of regulatory oversight and reform,” he wrote in an email response to my questions. “Bitcoin currency exchanges act like de facto banks. Many customers leave the bitcoins in accounts at the exchanges, but there are no capital requirements as there are for traditional banks.”

This makes bitcoin exchanges vulnerable to withdrawal spikes, otherwise known as bank runs. Moore said the security breach at Mt. Gox wiped out the capital reserves of the exchange. He examined the track record of 40 bitcoin exchanges and found that 18 have closed “with customer account balances often wiped out.”

Bitcoin was supposedly created about five years ago by a computer programming genius named Satoshi Nakamoto — probably a pseudonym. Nakamoto created 31,000 lines of computer code that essentially created bitcoin, according to The New Yorker magazine.

Through this computer program, he set a limit on the amount of Bitcoin that would eventually be available in the system. Only 21 million bitcoins will be created over the next 20 years and currently about 12 million are in virtual circulation, meaning they are held in bitcoin “wallets” inside computers all over the world.

When I last wrote about the bitcoin phenomenon last summer, the exchange rate was $100 for one bitcoin. As it gained popularity it topped $1,100 in December.

But with the bad publicity swirling around Mt. Gox, one bitcoin now fetches about $500. Some 850,000 bitcoins, or about 7 percent of the bitcoins in circulation, were stolen from Mt. Gox.

Moore cited several examples of security breaches at bitcoin exchanges and other frauds. While it didn’t involve an exchange, one of the largest bitcoin Ponzi schemes occurred here in North Texas

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint dated July 23, 2013, that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.

The SEC is seeking monetary penalties and the return of the ill-gotten gains.

Perhaps the government can get back some of the lost money for investors if in fact this was a Ponzi scheme. But for the long-term stability of bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, Moore advocates some kind of mechanism “to reimburse customers for fraudulent transactions.”

An article in The Atlantic probably summed it up best: “No matter how perfect a technological concept is, when it enters the world of human beings, it becomes imperfect. Bitcoin is no exception.”###3023||Empty###3024||SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian markets were set for another tense session on Tuesday as worries about China’s economy continue to reverberate, taking a particularly hard toll on commodity prices.

February’s shock fall in exports from the Asian behemoth has cast a shadow over the global outlook, even as analysts blamed much of the drop on the Lunar New Year holidays.

Oil and industrial commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off. Copper futures shed almost 2 percent on Monday, while spot prices for iron ore .IO62-CNI=SI tumbled over 8 percent.

Brent crude lost 92 cents to $108.08, while U.S. oil extended its decline to $100.94 a barrel.

Investors will be nervously watching Chinese money markets and the yuan for any evidence the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is engineering an easing in monetary conditions after it forced the currency sharply lower on Monday. <TOP/CEN>

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor unease. In Crimea, unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post. Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis. <TOP/NEWS>

Yet, after an initial spill, Wall Street did manage to pare losses. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost just 0.05 percent.

That resilience might help steady nerves in Asia, and it was notable that Nikkei futures were only down slightly.

In early trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was holding steady, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday.

Other popular indicators of risk were also muted. The stock market’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, ended little changed after an early spike, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent.

Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the U.S. dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies .DXY.

Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, came off half a U.S. cent but found solid support around $0.9025.

The euro held steady at $1.3876, as was the dollar at 103.26 yen.

Later on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is expected to reaffirm its commitment to massive monetary stimulus. Nothing new is expected at the policy meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April.

The Japanese economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent annualized pace in the last quarter of 2013 as net exports proved a major drag, intensifying pressure for fresh action form the central bank.

The BOJ’s decision is due anytime after 0300 GMT, and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference afterward.###3025||Empty###3026||Empty###3027||Empty###3028||Mt Gox collapse shatters Bitcoin myth of virtual money By Peter Morici

Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed. The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing. Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your wealth—you can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barter—a necessity for even the most rudimentary market economy. Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government declares those to be “legal tender for all debts public and private.” You can do business through barter or some alternative currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars, and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter. What gives money its value are the goods and services that may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the issuing government. The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more than two thousand years ago. The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and destroy its value through inflation. However, inflation is hardly a problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies. Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency’s creator, and like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world. There is no “Bitland” where a government has declared it legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes. Lacking such a tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day, never mind next year. Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands only about half that amount. It is no place for your children’s college fund or retirement savings. Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to thieves. A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them. Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard. However, personal and business transactions can be spied by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your exchange when it needs. Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised. Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a currency accepted and secure—the government guarantee and the good sense of the sovereign not to abuse its franchise. It’s not the gold but the face of Caesar—the promise his image carries—that makes a coin money.

###3029||Comcast: We're Lobbying Congress For You, The People!

There's really no doubt that Comcast has its tendrils in deep when it comes to lobbying for approval of their $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable. The revolving door helps; former FCC boss Michael Powell now heads the NCTA, the cable industry's largest lobbying group. Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker, who voted for Comcast's acquisition of NBC while at the FCC, now lobbies the FCC for Comcast. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen formerly provided legal counsel for Comcast.

But the company is also throwing money hand over fist at both parties in the hopes that they can quite simply buy merger approval. Comcast PACs have given money to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and nearly all of the folks who'll be responsible with reviewing their merger application.

They've also donated to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, who'll be holding an upcoming merger hearing.

quote: “Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,” said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice. “It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers."

None of this is particularly surprising, given that this is how a broken democracy works. Whatsurprising is that in defending the practice, Comcast attempts to tell Politico in a roundabout way that they're doing this all for employees (who'll likely see layoffs from duplicate positions) and customers (who are more than certain to see rate hikes either way):That's a Comcast representative trying to claim that because lawmakers technically represent, throwing money at them to support a merger that likely won't help you in the slightest is perfectly ok.###3030||A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were escorting it to port on Tuesday, MPs said.

Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14 percent so far this year on the global uncertainties.

A recent bond default in China and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower. More data on Thursday showed China’s economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows.

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,371.76 an ounce by 0737 GMT, after jumping 1.3 percent on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit $1,374.85, its highest since September 10.

Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near $1,355 an ounce.

“Given bullion’s technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions,” HSBC analysts said in a note.

“Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold.”

Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at $1,375-$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards $1,433.31, the August 28 high.

The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year.

However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday - the first decline since February 19.

Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China - the biggest bullion consumer - trading at a discount to spot prices.###3033||Empty###3034||Kuala Lumpur: The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on 8 March with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering a area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane—an informal “all right, good night”—was spoken after the system, known as “ACARS”, was shut down.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19am, as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system—a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status—had been received at 1.07am, as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”

Vast search corridors

Police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests it could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.

Aviation officials in Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan—as well as Taliban militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan—said they knew nothing about the whereabouts of the plane.

“The idea that the plane flew through Indian airspace for several hours without anyone noticing is bizarre,” a defence ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are seeking to oust foreign troops and set up an Islamic state, said the missing plane had nothing to do with them.

“It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went,” he said. “So we also do not have any information as it is an external issue.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbour to “immediately” expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

Malaysian acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said diplomatic notes had been sent to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force were also searching the southern corridor, he said, and US P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft were being sent to Perth, in Western Australia, to help scour the ocean.

Focus on crew

The plane’s disappearance has baffled investigators and aviation experts. It vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities believe that, as the plane crossed the northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned west.

That has focused attention on the crew. Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, Hishammuddin said: “We are looking at it.” But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.

Police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practise flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.

“Based on what we have so far, we cannot see the terrorism link here,” he said. “We looked at known terror or extremist groups in Southeast Asia. The links are not there.”

North or south?

Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia. Three French civil aviation experts involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009 arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to help.

A source familiar with official US assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor. Reuters###3035||MILAN — UniCredit SpA reported Tuesday a massive net loss for the fourth quarter, after a giant write-down on the value of past acquisitions and bad loans, as it published a new four-year strategic plan.

The bank UCG, -0.96% UNCFF, -4.50% said its net loss for the fourth quarter was 15 billion euros ($20.79 billion), compared with 553 million euros for the same period of the previous year.

The bank, Italy’s largest lender by assets, opted to set aside 9.3 billion euros to cover bad loans in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.5 billion euros for the same period of the previous year, as it prepares for the review of its asset that the European Central Bank is carrying out before taking over supervision of the continent’s largest lenders.

The bank also wrote down the value of past acquisitions by 9.3 billion euros, which it said led to the full write-down of the goodwill allocated to Italy, Central and Eastern Europe and Austria.

The bank said the remaining goodwill on its balance sheet amounts to 3.5 billion euros, which is broadly in line with its 2004 level.

Gains in most revenue streams were in line with the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

The bank said its board approved a strategic plan that will drive the bank’s activity until 2018. It forecasts a net profit of 6.6 billion euros for 2018.

The firm also is planning to cut 8,500 jobs.

The world's largest fast food chain said global comparable sales decreased by 0.3% last month, as Europe same store sales increased 0.6% while the metric in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region fell 2.6%.

International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan, as well as by a stronger dollar, which makes its food more expensive overseas.

"We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," said McDonald's CFO Pete Bensen in a statement announcing the sales figures this morning.

"Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth."

The company said that systemwide sales globally, which includes sales at all restaurants whether operated by McDonald's or its franchisees, would have increased 2.2% if not for the weight of the stronger dollar instead of a 0.6% decline in February.

The burger chain blamed weakness in the U.S. last month, on top of a same store sales drop of 3.3% in January, on "challenging industry dynamics" and the harsh winter weather, while European sales were bolstered by the U.K. and France, mostly offsetting poor performance in Germany.

Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald’s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.

Shares of McDonald's were down 0.3% on Monday morning, at US$95.24, stretching year-to-date losses to almost 2%.###3037||What stocks are you watching? Sign up to get started or log in to see your watchlist. Sign Up Log In

At 1200 AEDT on Monday, the local unit was trading at 90.51 US cents, down from 90.90 cents on Friday.

The currency fell as low as 90.31 US cents during the local session but has since recovered somewhat.

Over the weekend, Russian state-owned company Gazprom increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government by threatening to cut off gas supplies.

But, FXCM currency strategist Ilya Spivak says he doesn't expect problems in Ukraine to have too much of an affect on markets.

"Vested economic and geopolitical interests in Ukraine, from both Russia and the West, should be enough to have cooler heads prevail," he said.

"It is arguably for that reason that Eastern European troubles have not sparked broader emerging market contagion and financial market distress."

Mr Spivak said the Australian dollar should be well supported this week after last week's raft of positive economic data.

He said that data increased the likelihood of a period of interest rate stability and decreased the chances of another cash rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia.

"The fourth-quarter GDP (gross domestic product) report topped economists forecasts, showing the year-on-year growth rate accelerated to 2.8 per cent and marked the highest reading since the three months through December 2012," Mr Spivak said.

"Meanwhile, retail sales unexpectedly jumped 1.2 per cent in January to yield the largest increase in 11 months.

"While an outright interest rate hike is still not being telegraphed over the coming 12 months, a meaningful hawkish shift in the underlying bias for what the RBA's next move will be is clearly perceptible."

Mr Spivak said the release on Thursday of local employment figures for February will give the market more of an insight into what and when the RBA's next move will be.

Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was weaker.

Financial markets are broken, dominated by a small clique of corrupt bankers who have subverted the whole meaning of capitalism for their own ends, Bank of England governor Mark Carney indicated this afternoon.

The solution: a new Bank of England deputy governor to reform the way the Bank interacts with markets, make sure key benchmarks like Libor and FX fixings are used for good, and consider new regulations to keep traders in line.

The current three deputy governors receive salaries of around £260,000, not a bad deal for a new deputy who is charged with stopping future scandals.

“What we saw in Libor and what the FCA is investigating in the FX markets around fixes, are symptomatic of a group of individuals in markets who have lost sight of what a real market is, and that is unacceptable,” Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

“Part of the way we ensure the Bank has its rightful place is to help lead the effort to rebalance these markets.”

The governor stressed that making real capitalism work is not just about defending banks but about their customers too, up and down the country.

“The market system is the best way to achieve allocative and dynamic efficiency, but it has to be a real market – not just that there is no market abuse, but that there is fair access to the market and that if you’re acting on behalf of a client that you’re giving them the best terms, equivalent to those you would get yourself,” he said.

And as well as protecting the rest of us, Carney added that these reforms are vital to the future of the Bank of England, too.

“This institution has to be beyond reproach, we have to have the highest standards of integrity,” he told MPs.

“We have to ensure we ruthlessly, relentlessly follow through with this investigation of what happened, that we explain very clearly why, if there were failings, those occurred, and ensure that these do not happen again.”###3042||Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Carney talks about risks in the banking system

Two new deputy governors have been named at the Bank of England, as part of a radical shake-up by governor Mark Carney.

Ben Broadbent will become deputy governor responsible for monetary policy, and Nemat Shafik will take charge of markets and banking.

Both will sit on the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC).

And Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability, will swap jobs with chief economist Spencer Dale.

There is a bewildering game of musical chairs going on at the Bank of England this morning. And pretty much every big job there, bar the very top one, is changing in some way

The appointments are the first of several changes being made as part of what Mr Carney has said will be a "root-and-branch" review of how the Bank conducts market intelligence, following criticism of its response to claims of manipulation of foreign exchange (forex) rates.

In a speech at Cass Business School Mr Carney set out his vision for the Bank.

He said the financial crisis was a "powerful reminder" that to maintain economic stability the Bank had to do more than just fight inflation.

Initiatives

To do that Mr Carney has set out fifteen initiatives to reshape the Bank.

They include the creation of Ms Shafik's Deputy Governor role to oversee markets and banking.

Also, the responsibilities of the chief economist will be expanded to help improve the Bank's collection of data.

Victoria Cleland has been named as the Director for Banknotes and Chief Cashier, replacing Chris Salmon.

The appointment means Ms Cleland's name will appear on banknotes.

Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said the dramatic changes indicated the extent of the changes Mr Carney planned to make.

"He's serious about making reform, not only to the structure of the Bank... but also in terms of its culture," he said.

'Pretty tough'

Ben Broadbent, who takes over from the retiring Charlie Bean on 1 July, will now be responsible for the Bank's analysis of the UK economy.

Ms Shafik, an International Monetary Fund official, will become the first female MPC member since 2010 when she replaces executive director for markets, Paul Fisher, on 1 August.

She will be in charge of the Bank's eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy, which it has so far used to inject £375bn into the economy by buying government bonds.

Ms Shafik will also lead the Bank's review on its market intelligence, which has come under attack after claims some Bank officials knew about the alleged fixing of foreign exchange rates.

Jonathan Portes, director of Britain's National Institute for Economic and Social Research said that she is a good person to monitor the financial industry.

"She's pretty tough and at the moment you need someone who is prepared to be fairly tough with the London financial sector," he said.

'Well-rounded'

In other changes, Anthony Habgood was named as chairman of the Bank's supervisory body, the Court of Directors, whose role will be to oversee Mr Carney's governance, including the Bank's adherence to official rules on how it operates.

"These appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank - one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation," said Mr Carney.

BNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments would add "a degree of raised uncertainty" about when the central bank would start to raise interest rates from their current 0.5% record low.

Mr Carney has also given the Bank a new mission statement: "Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability."###3043||We're always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what's going on!

Mark Carney will probably face his toughest questioning so far as Bank of England (BoE) governor today when MPs will seize on a foreign exchange scandal to press their demands for tighter oversight of the central bank.

A group of influential MPs has long been frustrated with what they say is the bank’s outdated governance system. The matter boiled up again last week when the BoE suspended an official amid an internal review into whether staff turned a blind eye to possible manipulation of key rates by foreign exchange traders.

The meetings at which the BoE and traders discussed possible problems in the market took place as far back as 2006, seven years before Carney’s arrival in London from Canada.

But MPs are angry that the bank’s governing board asked its oversight committee to investigate only last week.

Carney may also be asked to show how quickly he responded to signs of the case last year.

Mark Garnier, a member of the parliamentary committee that will hear Carney today, said perceptions that the BoE was not tough enough on tackling problems could damage London’s reputation as a financial centre, potentially weakening Britain’s hand in EU talks over financial reforms.

“We will be asking the governor what steps he is taking to bring management arrangements and committee structure up to the standards of the 21st century,” Andrew Love, another member of the treasury committee, said.

There could also be tough questions for another BoE policymaker. Paul Fisher previously chaired the foreign exchange joint standing committee, a forum for BoE officials and market players to discuss market issues.

It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings. – Reuters###3045||Empty###3046||Empty###3047||Empty###3048||By Mike Sherry

KHI News Service

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — With the deadline fast approaching to get health coverage this year through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace plans, a final push is on across Kansas, Missouri and other states to get people signed up.

“We have stepped up efforts with our outreach activities. Our navigators have jam-packed their schedules, getting appointments made to get people enrolled,” said Katrina McGivern, communications coordinator for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, one of the Kansas groups given federal grant dollars to help get people enrolled. The association represents Kansas’ various safety net clinics.

KAMU already had billboard advertisements for the Obamacare marketplace up in various parts of the state, but this past weekend also began airing ads in movie theaters. Radio and TV ads also have been airing in the various markets.

The last day of open enrollment is March 31 and most involved with it report that the pace has picked up considerably since the marketplace’s slow start in October 2013. Starting this year, most people who don’t have health insurance but can afford it will face penalties.’Starting to realize’

“I think people are starting to realize the deadline is coming. We’re seeing a lot of people who have never had insurance before. They don’t know about co-pays and deductibles. We’re really working with them from square one,” said Misty Kruger of the Shawnee County Health Agency in Topeka.

The agency hired certified navigators and counselors to help people get enrolled and stationed the workers at the public library, a popular community gathering spot, with hours that extend into the evenings and weekends.

Earlier this month in Kansas City, Kan., organizers held a two-day health fair as part of efforts to get the word out.

Salvador Lopez, an Excelsior Springs, Mo. farm worker, was among those who attended the event. He came with his wife and two daughters.

He said he would like health insurance so he could afford diabetes medicine. The coverage also could help his wife, who said she wasn’t feeling well as she had her blood pressure checked.

Lopez said Medicaid already covers his daughters and he was optimistic he would be able to find a plan he could afford through the new marketplace.

“It’s going to help me a lot,” he said.

“I would say the majority of people that we see have no idea what health insurance is, have never had it,” said Pam Seymour, executive director of Shepherd’s Center Central. The nonprofit has two locations in Kansas City, Mo., and has more than a dozen trained workers to help individuals navigate the enrollment process using the federal website.

Surge expected

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported last that 4.2 million people nationwide had purchased exchange plans through the end of February. The Congressional Budget Office had originally projected that 7 million people would enroll in private plans in the first year of the marketplace. Last month it revised that downward to 6 million.

The latest numbers from HHS included about 104,000 people who were signed up in Missouri and Kansas. According to federal estimates, about 1.1 million people in the two states are uninsured and eligible to participate in the exchange. Nationally, the number of uninsured people in 2012 was estimated at about 47 million.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 6 million people will get coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces this year, about 20 percent less than originally projected.

But officials said they are expecting there will be a flurry of enrollments at or near the deadline.

“What we are finding,” HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said with the release of the new enrollment numbers, “is that as more Americans learn just how affordable marketplace insurance can be, more are signing up.”

A department spokeswoman said agency officials were “busy preparing to handle an anticipated surge in enrollment as we approach the end of March.”

HHS officials said they had hired an additional 2,000 workers for the department’s help line – bringing the total to about 14,000 representatives.

Drafters of the Affordable Care Act intended the health insurance marketplaces to operate much like online systems that allow shoppers to compare prices on airline tickets or hotel rooms. The idea behind that was that competition among plans would yield the best deals for consumers.

There also was the assumption that the marketplace could give individuals the clout of being part of a large group similar to people enrolled in a large, employer-based plan.

Resistance

The health-reform law gave states the option of establishing their own marketplace or participating in a federally run exchange.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17 states have their own exchanges. The remaining states are relying on the federal marketplace or created a hybrid federal-state operation.

In many instances, as in Missouri and Kansas, the decision not to establish a state exchange stemmed from conservative Republican and/or voter opposition to Obamacare.

In November 2012, Missouri voters approved a proposition barring the governor or any state agency from helping establish an exchange without legislative or voter approval.

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a conservative Republican who ran for office campaigning against the health reform law, rejected $31.5 million in federal grant money that would have allowed the state to build its own exchange. He also rejected a plan that would have let the state partner with the federal government on a marketplace, opting instead for one run solely by the national government.

Final push

At the Shepherd’s Center in Kansas City, Seymour said, “everybody is ready and up to the challenge of getting these last-minute people enrolled. We are going to pull out all the stops and do whatever we need to do.”

Shepherd’s Center is among the various groups in Missouri and Kansas that are working to inform people that time is running out to buy insurance for 2014 through the marketplace. The next enrollment period starts in November.

Among the initiatives in the Kansas City metro area are Enroll Wyandotte, the coalition that sponsored the recent health fair, and CoverKC, a $700,000 effort bankrolled by the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City.

The St. Louis-based Missouri Foundation for Health has a statewide project called Cover Missouri.

In Kansas, the state insurance department is working with KAMU and other outside organizations to spread the word about the Obamacare health plans.

Various activities

Here are some of the efforts to date and plans for the next couple of weeks

• Cover Missouri: Has helped enroll about 68,000 Missourians for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, said Ryan Barker, health policy vice president at the Missouri Foundation for Health. That total includes some people who turned out to be eligible for Medicaid. With a multimedia campaign on tap, Barker said he hopes the effort can have 130,000 people enrolled by the end of the month.

• Among KAMU’s efforts is a text messaging campaign. And various KAMU members are running their own ad campaigns and enrollment events, including an “enrollment blitz” scheduled from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Center for Health and Wellness in Wichita. The Wyandotte Health Department will be taking enrollments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the deadline day.

• CoverKC: Since January, workers have knocked on more than 35,000 doors in the urban cores of Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., according to Jessica Hembree, program and policy officer for the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City. Organizers said they hope to have knocked at 70,000 doors by the end of this month, supplemented by mail, telephone and digital marketing.

• Enroll Wyandotte workers aim to have reached about 18,000 residents by the end of the month, said Jerry Jones, executive director of the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County. By the end of the next enrollment period, which ends in mid-January, Jones said the goal is to have 12,000 previously uninsured county residents enrolled in plans through the marketplace.

Enrollment workers said the federal website is working much better than it did last fall.

Field workers said it still can take upwards of two, three or five hours to enroll, if the case is complex, but that they are cautiously optimistic the anticipated surge of sign-ups in the next couple of weeks will not lead to another meltdown.

“We hope the process works better,” said Linda Sheppard, special counsel and director of health care policy and analysis at the Kansas Department of Insurance. “I assume it will. We will see what happens.”###3049||Jos. A. Bank Clothiers finally liked the look of Men's Wearhouse's takeover offer as the Hampstead-based retailer accepted a $1.8 billion buyout Tuesday.

The deal would pay Bank's stockholders $65 a share cash, $10 more than Men's Wearhouse initially offered in November, but their gain could mean more job losses in Maryland, where Bank traces its roots to 1905.

The combination of the nation's two biggest men's apparel specialty chains would create a $3.5 billion retail powerhouse with 1,700 stores across the United States and about 23,000 employees that analysts said could compete better with department stores and online sellers.

Men's Wearhouse said it would keep the Jos. A. Bank brand, and Bank terminated its recent agreement to acquire outdoor apparel retailer Eddie Bauer.

The deal ends months of acrimonious tug of war between the two rivals that started when Bank made a surprise $2.3 billion offer to buy Houston-based Men's Wearhouse in September. Spurning Bank's overtures, Men's Wearhouse turned the tables and moved to buy Bank in a series of bids that turned hostile in January.

Leaders of both companies struck much friendlier tones Tuesday after their boards of directors approved the transaction.

Men's Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert said his chain has "great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and is eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees. Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach."

Bank Chairman Robert N. Wildrick said the retailer's board has been focused on finding a strategic alternative that would maximize value for shareholders.

"The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded," Wildrick said.

Bank's shares rose nearly 4 percent Tuesday, closing at $64.22.

While the higher price is a boon to shareholders, it will bring increased pressure to trim expenses, said Steven Isberg, a finance professor at the University of Baltimore's Merrick School of Business.

"This is a much higher price than originally talked about, and they will not make it back through revenue enhancements," he said.

Isberg said all business processes will be on the table for being eliminated, from back-office operations to the supply chain, including reducing the number of distribution faculties.

"To generate the value they're paying, they're going to have to create some significant cost reductions, more significant than the earlier proposal," he said.

The companies expect expense savings of $100 million to $150 million over three years. The savings are expected to come from more efficient merchandise buying, improved customer service and marketing, and streamlining of corporate functions, they said.

Jos. A. Bank employs about 780 people in Carroll County between its headquarters and three distribution centers, making it the county's fourth-largest employer behind the school system and two hospitals.

It could be months before any decisions are made about the fate of those facilities. Any big changes would be unlikely before the deal closes, which is expected by the third quarter, analysts said.

State economic development officials said Tuesday that it is too early to know how the acquisition might impact Maryland jobs.

"We are hopeful that it will not have an impact and that those jobs will remain in Maryland," said Karen Glenn Hood, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Business and Economic Development. "We just don't have those details."

Consumers probably won't see significant changes.

"There will be no rebranding or remodels required — Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place," the companies said.

Still, the merger could be tricky, analysts said, as the retailer navigates an increasingly competitive retail climate while trying to become more efficient and combine two disparate corporate cultures yet retain brand identity and customer loyalty.

"They speak to two different types of customers," said Christine Carter, president of Baltimore-based Epps Consulting, a retail marketing firm. "Jos. A. Bank has more of a mom-and-pop feel, even though it's national, and more intimate relationships, where Men's Wearhouse comes across as a big box, one-size-fits all retailer. The challenge will be retaining the Jos. A. Bank customers."

A big challenge will be avoiding losing loyal customers who might perceive the merger as eliminating the brand they favor, said Roy DeYoung, senior vice president for Paradysz PM Digital, a New York-based marketing firm.

"There could be some customer apprehension about why are they doing this to my brand?" he said. "They're going to need to make a statement real soon to the customers — why we did the deal, what's in it for you, and join us in celebrating. They don't want an exodus."

DeYoung said that while a combined chain can expect a bigger share of the growing men's apparel market, it still faces stiff competition, not only from traditional department stores but from a growing number of online-only and catalog retailers.

Each chain will benefit from the other's strengths, said Mark Montagna, a senior research analyst with Avondale Partners LLC, a Nashville-based investment bank. Bank will get a boost for its tuxedo rental business, while Men's Wearhouse will get the advantage of lower costs and higher quality in sourcing products.

The deal still must be approved by shareholders and will get an antitrust review.

"It's a slam dunk — shareholders will approve this," Montagna said. "I think it's a good deal. It's a positive for shareholders of both companies."

Montagna said he doubted that the merger would be held up by antitrust issues because the combined company would represent only about 5 percent of the total menswear business.###3050||Why did this happen?

Get all the latest industry news in your inbox. Email address

New York — Dick’s Sporting Goods reported consolidated net income of $138.6 million, for the 13-week period ended Feb. 1. Results also exceeded the company’s performance in last year’s fourth quarter, which had an additional week. For the 14-week period ended Feb. 2, 2013, the company reported consolidated net income of $129.7 million.

The company reported a net sales increase for the quarter of 7.9% to $1.9 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. On a 13-week to 13-week basis, net sales increased 12.5%. Adjusted for the additional week last year’s fourth quarter, consolidated same-store sales increased 7.3% — compared to last year’s increase of 1.2% — although the company was expecting a 3 to 4% increase. Adjusted same-store sales in the quarter for Dick’s Sporting Goods stores increased 7.9% while same-store sales at Golf Galaxy decreased 11.7%. E-commerce penetration for the quarter was 12.2% of total sales.

"We generated strong results in our fourth quarter, with record earnings per share of $1.11, above the upper end of the guidance range we provided in our third quarter press release, as our sales and merchandise margin exceeded our expectations," said chairman and CEO Edward W. Stack. "As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omnichannel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings."

In the fourth quarter, the company opened six new Dick’s Sporting Goods stores, one new True Runner store and closed three underperforming Golf Galaxy stores. The company also remodeled one Dick’s Sporting Goods store during the fourth quarter. As of Feb. 1, the company operated 558 Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in 46 states, with approximately 30.1 million sq. ft. and 79 Golf Galaxy stores in 29 states, with approximately 1.4 million sq. ft.

In 2014, the company expects to open approximately 50 Dick’s Sporting Goods stores, relocate six Dick’s Sporting Goods stores and remodel five Dick’s Sporting Goods stores. The company also expects to open approximately eight Field & Stream stores, relocate two Golf Galaxy stores and open one Golf Galaxy store in 2014.###3052||Empty###3053||KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia | Officials dismissed reports Thursday that the missing Malaysian airliner's engines continued sending data for hours after its last contact, but said it was possible the plane continued flying and that they would widen their search farther to the west.

INTERACTIVE: What we know about the crash

The Wall Street Journal newspaper quoted U.S. investigators on Thursday as saying they suspected the Boeing 777 remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane's engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both had said the last engine data was received at 1:07 a.m., before the plane lost contact over the South China Sea on its way to Beijing.

An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea and also the Strait of Malacca because of unconfirmed military radar sightings indicating the plane may have changed course and headed west after it stopped communicating.

Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said, "of course, this is why we have extended the search."

He said the search had been expanded into the Andaman Sea and that the country was asking for radar data from neighboring countries. If the plane flew far from current search areas, then locating it will be a much harder task.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the disappearance of the plane and the 239 people on board.

With the end of the Cold War, NATO appeared to be on the road to irrelevancy. But the sunshine has faded. Russia's dismemberment of Ukraine should remind Americans and Europeans that European security, for which all of us paid a high price over the past hundred years, is not assured.

For Europe, the decade before 9/11 was hardly perfect. There were wars in the Balkans, and a civil war against Islamists in Algeria, across the Mediterranean. But Russia appeared to be democratizing. Turkey was moving toward Europe. The Israel-Palestinian peace process seemed to be working. Above all, Eastern Europe was secure and free.

Today, few of those hopes remain. Russia is an authoritarian menace. Turkey is unsure of its regional role. Palestinians have never unambiguously accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The Arab Spring has toppled old autocrats, and replaced them with new ones, or with violent radicalism.

All of that is bad. But worse, Americans and Europeans alike are operating on the strategy born in the sunny 1990s. We act as though Europe has solved its security problem, as though it has stable and increasingly friendly borders. It does not.

NATO still exists, but a military alliance without a military is a contradiction in terms. European defense budgets have shrunk, reflecting the broader European public distaste for anything that reeks of hard power. Regrettably, most of the world feels differently.

And since the United States no longer has a single Army brigade permanently deployed in Europe, our own commitment has melted away. This is not because of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia. It's because of the gradual U.S. acceptance after 1989 that most of Europe's problems had been solved, and the European Union could be trusted to handle what was left.

The EU's approach was to employ soft power. North Africa would be slowly pushed toward reform by investment and diplomacy, Turkey would be strung along in negotiations about EU membership, and Ukraine would be pulled westward by support for civil society.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But in most cases, the EU's approach didn't work. Turkey tired of the EU's road to nowhere. North Africa didn't reform; it revolted. Ukraine was pulled toward Europe, but the EU's soft power strategy has been crushed by Russia's hard power hammer.

Russia's Vladimir Putin doesn't want to recreate the Soviet empire. He's learned the lesson of its fall: Don't occupy big places, like Poland, that hate your guts. His strategy is subtle: Use a Russian population, or create it by distributing passports, to manufacture grievances, then occupy a little chunk of territory and intimidate the rest. He still has vulnerable neighbors, including the Baltic republics.

This week, the crisis is in Ukraine. But Crimea looks likely to join Kaliningrad, Belarus, Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia and Chechnya, all of which are either occupied in whole or in part by Russia, or are pseudo states recognized primarily by Russia and its cronies. These conflicts are frozen by Russian power, and too often ignored by the West, which encourages Putin to try again.

So the first job for the United States and Europe is not responding to the Ukrainian crisis, per se. It is to recognize that our strategy for securing Europe from the troubled periphery is broken. These threats do not stem only from Putin, though he creates more than his fair share. Contrary to our hopes, Europe still has a security problem, one that cannot be met by the EU. As in the Cold War, it will take American leadership in NATO, and American recommitment to the security of Europe.###3055||Toyota Kirloskar Motors has declared a lockout at its Bidadi manufacturing facility with effect from March 16 due to labour related issues. The company has issued a press release in this regard which says that the management and union had been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY13-14 for the past 10 months. As a bipartite agreement was not reached, the labour department of the Government of Karnataka conducted seven tripartite meetings in order to reach a settlement. The conciliation efforts of the Labour Department have not yet resulted in an agreement.

The official statement furthers says, “In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days. All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lock-out notice. With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel.” However, the workers union has not issued any statement regarding the charter of demands or the lockout.

The Japanese automaker currently manufactuers the Innova MPV, Fortuner SUV, Corolla Altis as well as the Etios and Liva at the plant outside Bengaluru. It locally assembles the Camary and imports the Landcrusier Prado, Prius Hybrid and LC 200 for the Indian market.

Toyota is the second major Japanese automaker to declare a lockout of its plant in the last two years. Maruti Suzuki has faced a similar scenario in 2012 but on a much more violent scale and it is probable that Toyota does not want to see such an incident at its plant. Workers at Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar plant rioted on the evening of August 17 after talks with management over various issues failed. The riots saw 96 people injured and one death resulting in the plant being locked out for a month.###3056||The Sbarro pizza restaurant chain filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, just three weeks after it closed down 40 percent of its locations, mostly in airports, malls and highway rest stops.

Click here for reprint permission.###3057||Empty###3058||Empty###3059||Urban Outfitters‘ (NASDAQ:URBN) Q4 fiscal 2014 revenues increased by 6% to $906 million, but missed expectations of $926 million. While the retailer recorded strong sales growth for its Anthropologie and Free People brand, its namesake business stumbled due to missed fashion calls and severe winters in the U.S. However, Urban Outfitters’ Q4 earnings per share of $0.59 was better than the consensus estimate of $0.56.

In the current environment, U.S. retailers are struggling for growth due to weak consumer spending and fierce competition from fast fashion brands such as Forever 21 and H&M. Considering this, Urban Outfitters’ 1% comparable sales growth looks quite impressive, which was driven by higher e-commerce revenues, average unit retail and units per transactions, partially offset by low store traffic. [ ]

Although the company’s near term growth might be slow as it expects to continue facing challenges with the Urban Outfitters brand, long term outlook is promising. We believe that Urban Outfitters brand will perform better eventually, driven by its several initiatives. Meanwhile, the company has stated that customer response to its other brands, Anthropologie and Free People, has been very strong so far. This indicates that given the right product mix and marketing, these brands can propel Urban Outfitters’ long term growth.

Our price estimate for Urban Outfitters stands at $43, implying a premium of about 15% to the market price. However, we are in the process of updating our model in light of the recent earnings release.

See our complete analysis for Urban Outfitters Inc.

Anthropologie Shows Promise

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Anthropologie registered 10% rise in retail comparable sales driven by its compelling product offerings and store shopping experience. The brand has improved its product mix and designs substantially over the last few quarters, which resulted in double-digit growth in its regular price comparable sales in Q4. Total markdown rate during the fourth quarter decreased by 20% as compared to the same quarter last year, which is very impressive considering that the holiday season of 2013 was more promotional than the holiday season of 2012. Since Anthropologie’s updated theme of sensual and feminine looks has found tremendous acceptance among its customers, we believe the trend is likely to continue. To attract customers and enhance its appeal, the brand also creates engaging story telling techniques through its store windows, visual merchandising and display, along with catalog and email communications. This should assist the brand in driving store traffic going forward.

Apart from its core merchandise offerings, Anthropologie’s new products have also performed very well. During Q4, the brand continued to expand its boutique assortments and it now offers this category in seven Anthropologie stores. Boutique assortment sales increased by 303% in the fourth quarter and the brand plans to expand this category to twelve additional stores in fiscal 2015. [ ] This move adds a new category to the Anthropologie portfolio, which can make a material contribution in the future.

Free People Continues To Surge

Urban Outfitters’ Free People brand has grown at a robust pace over the past few years, which continued in fiscal 2014 as well. The brand’s revenues in fiscal 2014 increased by almost 30% and its comparable sales during the fourth quarter surged by 20%. Moreover, Free People’s international and domestic shop-in-shop expansion resulted in 24% rise in wholesale revenues. Alongside, the brand continued the expansion of its intimate category, where retail sales grew twice as fast as apparel sales. Sales penetration of intimates in wholesale revenues increased by as much as 320 basis points. This indicates that even though U.S. buyers have been reluctant to spend on apparel, they have shown great affinity towards intimate products. Victoria’s Secret’s recent success in the U.S. further confirms this trend. Free People’s footwear category also registered a strong rise of 54% in retail revenues, suggesting that buyers have developed a liking for the brand.

Overall, Free People turned out to be the most productive brand for Urban Outfitters in terms of revenue per square foot in fiscal 2014. Although the brand does not contribute much to the retailer’s revenues at present, it can become a big business in the future if it sustains its healthy growth rate.

Urban Outfitters Can Improve In The Long Run

Urban Outfitters’ namesake brand’s comparable sales declined by 9% during the quarter mainly due to weak response to its fashion and partially on account of adverse weather conditions (450 basis points contribution). The management stated that poor product execution and lack of creativity resulted in the brand’s dismal performance. Although it is unlikely that Urban Outfitters will see a complete turnaround in the first quarter, it will improve eventually as the company is prioritizing the brand’s revival in fiscal 2015. [ ]

Urban Outfitters is elevating its creative functions and restructuring new procedures and communication, into a more central role in order to reconnect with its core customers. During the quarter, Urban Outfitters introduced a new concept named “Without Walls”, which aims to attract young customers with active lifestyle products, placed in an enthralling environment. The concept was recently launched in five stores, where it received tremendous customer response. The retailer is now planning to open three to six such store-in-store locations in fiscal 2015. [ ]

Additionally, the company made significant strides towards the improvement of its supply chain system during the year, which should assist Urban Outfitters’ revival. The retailer lowered its weeks of supply by one week and reduced its lead times by more than 10%. This should help it better adjust to the changing customer preferences. It also reduced direct-to-consumer orders fulfilling time by 30% and shipping time by over 15%, to improve the customer service. We believe that these efforts along with an improvement in design should help the brand’s steady recovery going forward.

The flotation is expected to generate proceeds in excess of $15bn (£9bn), ranking the company’s listing alongside record-breaking IPOs such as Visa, which raised $17.9bn (£10.8bn) in 2008, and Facebook, which took $16bn (£9.6bn) in 2012.

Alibaba, the world’s largest online retailer with over 500 million customers, did not release details of the size or date of the listing, but sources said that it will be in the second half of the year.

The company is in talks with six banks – Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley – for lead underwriting roles, which would yield an estimated $260m (£156m) in fees, a source close to the situation said.

Alibaba said that listing in the US would make it “a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency.”

The announcement ends months of speculation over where the Hangzhou-based group, which is expected to reach a value of $200bn (£120bn) by the end of this year, would hold its IPO.

In September last year, Alibaba indicated that it favoured New York after Hong Kong regulators balked at its proposed structure, which allows a group of partners to nominate the majority of the board of directors.

At the time, Joe Tsai, executive vice chairman, said: “We understand Hong Kong may not want to change its tradition for one company, but we firmly believe that Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes.

“The question Hong Kong must address is whether it is ready to look forward as the rest of the world passes it by.”

Last week, the Financial Times reported that Alibaba, which made a net profit of $801m (£482m) in Q3 last year, had stopped engaging with Hong Kong and was “95pc” certain to choose New York for its initial public offering.

In a statement, the company said that it would also consider listing on China’s capital market in future to share its growth with local investors.

The statement continued: “We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group. We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”

The announcement comes two days after Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, announced plans for a $500m (£301m) listing in the US.###3061||Empty###3062||Investing in Real Estate

Experts have always considered investing in real estate an outstanding investment. However, the house you live in isn’t necessarily an investment: True real estate investments are typically comprised of buying, holding, fixing and flipping rental properties, forming REITs, handling short-term rentals and more.

When you invest in in real estate, it’s key to keep your emotions out of the equation. You won’t be buying a house that you’re going to live in or pass down to your children, so you need to look at the property simply as a tool that’s going to generate an additional stream of income for you.

One of the best ways to invest in real estate is through buying rental properties. You purchase a home or apartment building —fix it up if you need to — and rent it out. Rental properties allow someone else to pay down your mortgage and then some.

Vodafone will acquire Ono for €7.2bn ($10.03bn, £6bn), including about €3.3bn in debt. Private equity-backed Ono is Vodafone's third acquisition in European fixed-broadband industry in two years.

Vodafone intends to source the acquisition from existing cash and debt.

Shares in the company rose 1.06% as at 8:42 am GMT, following the announcement.

The deal was reached after months of talks with Ono and its private equity owners: Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H Lee Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital, according to the Financial Times.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said Vittorio Colao, Vodafone CEO.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said José María Castellano Ríos, chairman of the Ono board.

The acquisition is expected to be part of the company's strategy to enlarge its global footprint after the $120bn sale of US arm to Verizon Wireless.

In September, Vodafone agreed to buy a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel Deutschland. It had earlier agreed with French telecoms operator Orange to build out fibre networks in Spain – a move which is expected to complement the Ono deal.

Attractive Synergies

Ono is Spain's second-largest provider of broadband internet, pay TV and fixed-line. Vodafone is likely to add extra products to bundled tariffs as well as reduce the cost of its offerings.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the past few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market," Colao added.

The company expects about €1bn of revenue synergies by combining distribution, marketing and cross-selling in Spain. Meanwhile, annual cost and capital expenditure synergies are expected at about €240m.###3066||(CNN) — General Motors knew of an issue with its ignition switch several years before it has previously acknowledged knowing of a fault with that part.

If that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven’t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I’m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we’re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.

I’d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then – the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends – but that’s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.

Of course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.

At the same time, it’s not easy to follow Warren Buffett’s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence – a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks – has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.

Whatever the reason for the average investor’s reluctance to load up on stocks, it’s clear they haven’t benefitted as much from the market’s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve — about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains.

Let’s put to one side the vexing question of whether that’s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market’s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed – most dramatically during the course of 2013 – but personal earnings and profits didn’t.

By the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon, it was already 2013. The lion’s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well.

The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It’s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth. And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.

The Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It’s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales.

That doesn’t mean that we’re about to careen off the edge of a cliff – clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.

It’s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market’s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.

If you haven’t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so – and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.

The recent bankruptcy of the Bitcoin exchange has many up in arms and some are deciding to get answers on their own. Some of the data released and posted on Reddit has already been taken down. Greenberg reached out to disgraced Mt.Gox C.E.O. Mark Karpeles but has yet to get a reply back.

From the article:

The Bitcoin community has been angrily pressing for details on what the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users’ bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox’s staff isn’t talking. So another group of hackers say they’ve broken into the company’s servers to provide answers of their own.

On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. “It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt.

Tensions over Ukraine continued to build and with diplomacy at a standstill, European Union governments said they were considering sanctions against Russia if it failed to respond positively to an initiative to calm the crisis. The Ukraine crisis sapped appetite for risk and weighed on U.S. equities, which also boosted gold demand. The precious metal also climbed after China's data showed exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the world's second-largest economy. However, analysts warned of possible gold losses if geopolitical tensions ease and U.S. economy recovers. "If the Russian situation can be contained and U.S. data continues to hold in, gold will turn into an excellent short opportunity once again, with specs likely to flip back from long to short quite quickly," said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. Spot gold was up 0.7 percent at $1,346.70 an ounce by 2:35 p.m. EDT (1835 GMT), having earlier reached $1,352.50, near a four-month high. U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $5.20 at $1,346.70 an ounce, with volume about 10 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. The confrontation around the Black Sea peninsula showed no sign of easing on Tuesday, a day after pro-Russian forces opened fire in seizing a Ukrainian military base in Crimea and NATO announced reconnaissance flights along its eastern frontiers. "There is still a good deal of safe-haven bidding in the market on Ukraine and any possible Russian response, and that's helping get beyond that crucial $1,350 technical and psychological level," Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said.

Sens. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a joint press release that they would release legislative text in coming days that would closely mirror an existing bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators on the committee, led by Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Bob Corker, R-Tenn.

Both bills would wind down and eliminate the mortgage behemoths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were taken into federal conservatorship after failing in 2008 and have remained in the government's control since. In recent months, the two companies have returned to profitability, so far yielding the government more in dividends than the $187.5 billion it cost to bail them out.

Both Senate measures would establish a Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, modeled on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that provides depositors' insurance for banks. The FMIC would provide insurance on approved mortgage-backed securities that would only kick in once the private owners of those securities had suffered some losses. The FMIC would be intended to ensure a liquid market for mortgage securities while avoiding taxpayer losses on guaranteed loans.

The Johnson-Crapo plan would eliminate federal housing affordability goals in favor of housing funds taken from FMIC user fees and provide a securitization platform that would allow for standardized mortgage securities without Fannie and Freddie's influence.

Fannie and Freddie do not issue loans but buy mortgages from lenders and package them into guaranteed securities to sell to investors. In recent years, following the collapse of the housing bubble, Fannie- and Freddie-backed mortgages have accounted for as much as two-thirds of all new home loans.

The details of the differences between the Johnson-Crapo plan and the Warner-Corker plan are not yet known, but it was widely expected that, as chairman and ranking member, the two senators would want to put their own stamps on the legislation that would likely prove to be at the center of congressional debate in the years ahead. Although the political atmosphere is thought to preclude action on housing finance reform during the current Congress, lobbyists and housing activists have suggested that the bipartisan Senate bill will likely be the vehicle for reform in the medium-term.

Originally, Johnson and Crapo had said that they hoped to introduce their own measure in 2013. But the drama surrounding the government shutdown and the debt ceiling interrupted their schedule.

Although it is not actively involved in the push for housing finance reform, the White House has signaled support for the basic outline of the Senate bipartisan bill. President Obama said last year that the Corker-Warner principles were "consistent" with his own.

But House Republicans are not on the same page. The House Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, last year approved a bill to wind down Fannie and Freddie and remove the government's involvement in backstopping mortgage-backed securities. Instead, that legislation involved a privately run utility that would have standardized mortgage products without involving a guarantee. The federal government would retain a role in subsidizing mortgages only through the Federal Housing Administration, which insures loans for low-income home buyers. The House Republican bill would relax the FHA’s requirements during a downturn, to allow it to play a countercyclical role.

That bill, which is opposed by homebuilders' groups, has not advanced in the House, nor does it have support in the Senate.

Hensarling issued a statement Tuesday in which he thanked Johnson and Crapo for working to end the "unacceptable" status quo. But he also said that he is "skeptical" of any plan that does not end government guarantees in secondary mortgage market, warning that the bill could "perpetuate the cycle of boom, bust and bailout we tragically just witnessed."###3074||Empty###3075||The debacle surrounding Mt.

Over the weekend hackers released information they claim shows Karpeles continues to lie about the amount of bitcoin stolen from the exchange, however the continuing uncertainty over what exactly happened at Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have impacted the value of cryptocurrencies in general.

According to stats from CoinMarketCap.com, bitcoin's value rose 3% in the last 24 hours to $640, continuing to show resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency is still some way off its high of $1,200, it is proving some naysayers wrong by remaining relatively stable in the face of widespread upheaval.

Bitcoin's relative stability has buoyed the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with 11 of the top 15 mineable cryptocurrencies showing a rise in value in the last day.

The big winner however was the eco-focused mintcoin which rose some 30% in value in the last 24 hours.

Hackers claim Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles is lying

Over the weekend hackers posted account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.

The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.

The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called "Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!" and posted the stolen information there.

Karpeles is remaining silent about the accusations for now.

The bitcoin-friendly gunstore

The reputation of bitcoin was for years hampered by its connection to illicit marketplaces on the dark web - such as Silk Road - where you could anonymously buy everything from drugs to machine guns.

Now one businessman is looking to get remove that stigma by allowing people to purchase guns using bitcoin directly in its store. The firearm shop and training centre Central Texas Gunworks , based in Austin, has installed a bitcoin ATM to allow those wishing to purchase a gun using the cryptocurrency to do so.

However, unlike on the dark web, you won't be able to buy any firearms anonymously as the same paperwork and background checks required of anyone will still apply. Even online buyers can only have firearms shipped to a nearby gun store where the same legal process applies.

Dogecoin on BitPay before Litecoin

According to a comment from the CEO of Bitcoin payment processor startup BitPay, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin could be the next virtual currency accepted on the platform – even before the world's second biggest cryptocurrency litecoin.

Reddit user and dogecoin enthusiast jimmy0x52 claims to have spoken to CEO of BitPay Tony Gallippi at music, film, and interactive conference SXSW which is taking place in Texas this week. Gallippi is reported to have said:

"Think about the consumer - if they have LTC [litecoin] they have BTC [bitcoin]. Doge is really popular and a whole new marketplace currency"

This is contrary to a tweet from BitPay in February, when it said: "Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow."

BitPay has yet to officially confirm its plans for accepting other cryptocurrencies, but with more than 10,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants on its books, the addition of dogecoin to a platform like BitPay could be huge for the young cryptocurrency.###3076||American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) ended a partnership agreement that allowed passengers to purchase connections from each other’s carrier.

“No, we didn’t get it cleared, but we don’t get our pop flies cleared either and those go higher than this thing did,” a team official said when contacted by The Associated Press. The drone flights ceased the next day. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named.



The agency bars commercial use of drones no matter how seemingly benign. The lone exception is an oil company that has been granted permission to fly drones over the Arctic Ocean, and it took an act of Congress to win that concession.



FAA officials say rules to address the special safety challenges associated with unmanned aircraft need to be in place before they can share the sky with manned aircraft. The agency has worked on those regulations for the past decade and is still months and possibly years away from issuing final rules for small drones, which are defined as those weighing less than 55 pounds. Rules for larger drones are even further off.



But tempting technology and an eager marketplace are outrunning the aviation agency’s best intentions. Photographers, real estate agents, moviemakers and others are hurrying to embrace the technology. Drones have been used to photograph the two apartment buildings that collapsed in New York City this past week and a car crash in Connecticut. The AP, in fact, is one of several news organizations studying the possible use of drones.



Unless FAA officials receive a complaint or chance upon a news story that mentions drone flights, they have little ability to find out about violations. The ban was further undercut this month when a federal judge dismissed the only fine the FAA has imposed on a commercial drone operator. The judge said the agency can’t enforce regulations that don’t exist.



The FAA, which contends it controls access to the national air space, has appealed.



The use of commercial drones, most of them small, is starting to spread to countries where authorities have decided the aircraft presents little threat if operators follow a few safety rules.



The drone industry and some members of Congress are worried the United States will be one of the last countries, rather than one of the first, to gain the economic benefits of the technology.



“We don’t have the luxury of waiting another 20 years,” said Paul McDuffee, vice president of drone-maker Insitu of Bingen, Wash., a subsidiary of Boeing. “This industry is exploding. It’s getting to the point where it may end up happening with or without the FAA’s blessing.”



In Japan, the Yamaha Motor Company’s RMAX helicopter drones have been spraying crops for 20 years. The radio-controlled drones weighing 140 pounds are cheaper than hiring a plane and are able to more precisely apply fertilizers and pesticides. They fly closer to the ground and their backwash enables the spray to reach the underside of leaves.



The helicopters went into use five years ago in South Korea and last year in Australia.



Television networks use drones to cover cricket matches in Australia. Zookal, a Sydney company that rents textbooks to college students, plans to begin delivering books via drones later this year. The United Arab Emirates has a project underway to see whether government documents like driver’s licenses, identity cards and permits can be delivered using small drones.



In the United Kingdom, energy companies use drones to check the undersides of oil platforms for corrosion and repairs, and real estate agents use them to shoot videos of pricey properties. In a publicity stunt last June, a Domino’s Pizza franchise in the U.K. posted a YouTube video of a “DomiCopter” drone flying over fields, trees and homes to deliver two pizzas.



But when Lakemaid Beer tried to use a drone to deliver six-packs to ice fishermen on a frozen lake in Minnesota, the FAA grounded the brewskis.



Andreas Raptopoulous, CEO of Matternet in Menlo Park, Calif., predicts that in the near term, there will be more extensive use of drones in impoverished countries than in wealthier nations such as the U.S.



He sees a market for drones to deliver medicines and other critical, small packaged goods to the 1 billion people around the globe who don’t have year-round access to roads.



Later this year, Matternet plans to start selling to government and aid organizations a package that includes a drone and two landing pads. On the return trip, the drones can carry blood samples bound for labs and other packages.



Germany’s express delivery company Deutsche Post DHL is testing a “Paketkopter” drone that could be used to deliver small, urgently needed goods in hard-to-reach places. Facebook is in talks to buy Titan Aerospace, a maker of solar-powered drone-like satellites, to step up its efforts to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world.



There is also a strong business case for urban drones that can replace truck deliveries of single packages.



“If you look at the economic footprint and CO2 emissions,” Raptopoulous said, the drone “beats the truck hands down.”



Worldwide sales of military and civilian drones will reach an estimated $89 billion over the next decade, according to the Teal Group, an aerospace research company in Fairfax, Va. The FAA estimates as many as 7,500 small commercial drones will be in use within five years once the necessary regulations are in place.



Jim Williams, head of the FAA’s drone office, said writing rules for the U.S. is more complex than other nations. The U.S. has far more air traffic than anywhere else and a greater variety of aircraft, from hot air balloons and old-fashioned barnstormers to the most sophisticated airliners and military and business jets. At low altitudes, the concern is a small drone could collide with a helicopter or small plane flown by a recreational pilot.



“It’s a different culture in the U.S. and Canada,” Williams said in an interview. “People believe they have the right to just jump in their airplane and fly just like they do their car. ... We can’t set up a system that puts any of those folks at risk.”



Yet the FAA permits hobbyists to fly model aircraft that have so improved in technology that they’re little different from small drones. The FAA has issued voluntary guidelines for hobbyists, including staying away from airports, flying no higher than 400 feet and staying within the line of sight of the operator.



“You could go off to the hobby shop, buy a little remote control helicopter and fly it to your heart’s content,” McDuffee said. “But if you hung a digital camera on that, took pictures of your neighbor’s roof and sold those pictures to him or her, now you are in business and you’re flying” an unmanned aircraft system.



Sean Cassidy, senior vice president at the Air Line Pilots Association, said he worries that commercial drone users will be less willing than hobbyists to abide by restrictions because of economic pressures.



Drones are “becoming so prevalent and affordable that something has to be done to make sure they’re not being used in a reckless manner,” he, said. “Even a fairly small (drone), if the person flying this thing is unaware of their surroundings ... there could be very dire consequences.”

When the enrollment deadline for the Affordable Care Act rolls around, I will be one of the millions of Americans who hasn’t signed up. If it were entitled the Affordable Insurance Act it would at least bear an honest name. And as laudable as it may be to make health insurance more affordable, it has very little to do with health care.

The health insurance industry sucks billions of “health care” dollars from Americans without providing a single service that is health restorative in any sense. If anything, insurance costs, hassles and inadequacies should only be seen as exacerbating factors in dealing with problems of bad health. These billions of dollars, if not being used to generate profits as well as administering parameters and limits to health care, could be available to pay for the care itself. Some of it could stay in our pockets.

People claim that this arcane insurance gateway to health care system stems from our mistrust in government and our love for free enterprise. No matter that in one industrialized country after another, single payer health care systems are successfully taking care of peoples’ health at a much lower cost than we pay in America.

Our history is a free-for-all of healers of all stripes advertising their cures. While medical practices have ranged wildly over the spectrum, they shared one common quality; whether a quack or a surgeon, medical practitioners have mostly operated for profit. As a result many a poor American has perished from not being able to afford medical treatment. Instead of stepping in as a polis and understanding that a healthy life for everyone is necessary for a nation to thrive, we allowed the free enterprise system to intrude instead, creating a for-profit labyrinth of bureaucracies that served a majority of the public (good enough for private contractor work) while leaving a large minority without adequate access to health care.

Is there a risk to living without insurance? Of course there is. Even though the odds are in my favor (that’s where those insurance profits come from) and I’ve made it this far, an accident or sickness could leave me with an enormous bill to pay.

Even if the subsidies in the ACA offered me a chance to enroll relatively cheaply, I wouldn’t do so any more than I would spend medium amounts of money on anything that I didn’t like or didn’t believe in.

Call me old fashioned, but I’m also not willing to sally forth to Vermont Health Connect and give some website contractor all of the personal data that is required to determine eligibility for the ACA. When a government or industry spokesperson assures us the latest data breach probably won’t do any harm, it rings with the same false bravado that accompanies every declaration about “safe” radiation leaks that pose no threat to public health. I don’t bank or manage any of my affairs online. I rarely purchase anything online and I don’t share personal information, medical or otherwise, with anyone online. As I get by well enough without these Internet services, I’m less inclined to be sanguine about the possible cost of a hack attack or the loss of private data.

Is there a risk to living without insurance? Of course there is. Even though the odds are in my favor (that’s where those insurance profits come from) and I’ve made it this far, an accident or sickness could leave me with an enormous bill to pay. At that point, I’d be making monthly payments just like I would for insurance, but it would be paying for a service (even if an over-priced one.)

I am waiting instead for single payer health care to come to Vermont as planned by 2017. Some assert that IT problems with Vermont Health Connect are a harbinger of the disaster that single payer will surely be. But the current website and its problems should not bear have much bearing on Vermont’s eventual single payer system. We are already connected for single payer in that the state has already figured out how to reach us each year with a tax form. I’m happy to let the Legislature and the governor hash out what taxes will need to be raised to pay for providing health care in the state. And I’ll welcome the inevitable rise in taxes that I will face. Since I don’t pay for health insurance coverage, I will see an increase in taxes without a commensurate decrease in insurance premium rates.

But as much I am adamant in refusing to pay insurance premiums, I will have no problem in paying a hefty tax rise knowing that the money is paying for actual health care for all Vermonters. I have a debt to society in being part of it. I have no interest in being indebted to insurance corporations.###3085||The falling out between Bill Gross and his one-time partner Mohamed El-Erian has quickly turned into one of the ugliest bust-ups in recent history.

El-Erian stunned markets when he abruptly resigned as CEO of asset manager Pimco in January. Soon, reports emerged of tensions between him and Gross, the chief investment officer long revered for his prowess in the bond markets.

Those tensions came to a head Thursday when Gross told Reuters he had been monitoring El-Erian's phone calls and that El-Erian was trying to "undermine" him.

The tension over Gross's relationship with El-Erian has been exacerbated by his performance of late. In recent months Gross's flagship Total Return Fund has lagged most of its peers.

After losing nearly 2 percent in 2013-one of the strongest market years in history-some question whether Gross has lost his touch.

El-Erian has thus far been largely silent on Gross's claims. Many have speculated about his next move-US government service, or perhaps some sort of public position in his native Egypt.

Pimco's usually active Twitter account has been silent on the spat so far Friday morning. (Pimco emailed Reuters a statement in which it said: "Mr. Gross did not make the statements Reuters attributes to him.")

That hasn't stopped others, though, from commenting on the unusual spat.

London shares were flat on Tuesday as banking shares dropped after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned of a scandal from alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

The benchmark FTSE 100 index shed 3.93 points to end the day at 6,685.52 points.

"A bounce in Chinese equities after yesterday?s rout wasn't enough to convince UK markets this morning, with equities selling off," said Toby Morris, trader at CMC Markets.

"The Ukraine situation continues to rumble with no conclusion which doesn't help sentiment."

Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on Tuesday voted for full independence ahead of a referendum to join Russia, while France threatened sanctions against Moscow as early as this week.

The latest escalation of Europe's worst crisis for decades came moments after Ukraine's ousted pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovych defiantly vowed to return to Kiev from Russia and declared he was still the leader of the ex-Soviet country.

"The possibility of a war is forcing dealers to remain on the sidelines," said David Madden, market analyst at traders IG.

Carney said the potential repercussions of alleged fixing of currency values could be "as serious as" the Libor rate rigging scandal that rocked the financial sector.

"This is extremely serious... this is as serious as Libor, if not more so," Carney told a panel of MPs amid the forex investigation.

Canadian national Carney was grilled over the case after the Bank of England last week said it had suspended a worker following a review of its processes triggered by a probe into the suspected forex rigging.

At the time, the BoE said that it had found no evidence that staff colluded in the alleged manipulation of the global forex trades, 40 percent of which are conducted in London.

Banking shares fell as investors feared the possibility of more huge fines for the troubled sector.

State-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland sank 3.00 percent to 310.20 pence, Barclays fell 2.42 percent to 236.15 pence and Lloyds lost 0.48 percent to 81.11 pence.

Specialty chemical maker Johnson Mathey shed 2.89 percent to 3,096 pence and miner Antofagasta dropped 2.15 percent to 840 pence.

Sports Direct led the gainers, jumping 3.58 percent to 838 pence after news of a bonus scheme for the sportswear group's founder Mike Ashley, dealers said.

Sports Direct called a shareholders' meeting for next month at its Derbyshire headquarters to stage a vote on an incentive scheme worth an estimated £67 million to Ashley, the company's main shareholder as well as owner of Newcastle United football club.

"This reflected the fact that Mike Ashley had received no remuneration for his substantial contribution to the company since its initial public offering in February 2007," Sports Direct said in a statement.

"Since September 2012, the company's market capitalisation has increased from less than £2 billion to approximately £5 billion. The board believes that Mike Ashley is central to this value creation," the company said.

Investors were impressed by Sports Direct's assurance that Ashley will only get the bonus if EBITDA profits reach £330 million this year and £410 million next year.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group climbed 2.52 percent to 444 pence and insurer Aviva rose 2.75 percent to 523.50 pence.

The Morning Glory, which docked in al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

The central government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorization of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

But members of the General National Congress, Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow," one GNC member told Agence France Presse.

Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

The Morning Glory's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year autocratic rule of Moammar Gadhafi.

In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as regionalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.

There have been almost daily attacks on security and other government personnel in the region's main towns.

Former rebels calling for the restoration of the autonomy that Cyrenaica enjoyed for the first 12 years after Libyan independence in 1951, seized control of eastern export terminals last July.

They have made several attempts to export crude through their own oil company but the Morning Glory is the first to have successfully taken on crude.

"We are not demanding the breakup of the country," the head of the federalists' self-declared autonomous government, Abdrabbuh al-Barassi, said on Saturday.

"The oil revenues would be split between the three autonomous regions," he said, promising that all sales would be carried out with complete transparency.

But Washington said on Sunday that it was "deeply concerned" over the loading of "illicitly obtained" oil.

"This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

"The oil belongs to the Libyan National Oil Company and its joint venture partners."

Warships had deployed to block the Morning Glory after Culture Minister Amin al-Habib warned on Sunday the tanker would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it tried to leave port.

The GNC said a task force composed of both regular troops and ex-rebel militia was being formed to bring the rebel ports back under central government control within a week.

But analysts warned that any resort to force risked plunging Libya back into civil war and wreaking major damage to the country's key oil infrastructure.

The standoff between the Tripoli authorities and the eastern rebels has already slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.

The simmering tensions in Libya helped push up oil markets Tuesday with New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in April, gaining 19 cents to $101.31 a barrel.

"Libya continues to support prices as well, with the threat to sink a North Korean tanker if it loads oil from a rebel held port being taken seriously in the markets," said analyst Joe Conlan at energy consultancy Inenco.###3101||Empty###3102||For Starbucks baristas, there was always one reason to resent ringing up a customer with with a Starbucks app or credit card: they couldn’t add a tip.

Representative Chris Kelly (D-Columbia) tells the House Committee on Crime Prevention and Public Safety, he once opposed the legalization of marijuana. He says it was during his time as a Boone County Associate Circuit Judge that he began to change his mind.

“I changed kind of gradually,” says Kelly. “I saw too many young people whose lives were ruined by convictions for small amounts of marijuana.”

Kelly’s bill would make legal the possession of up to a pound of usable or solid marijuana and up to 72 ounces of marijuana in liquid form. It would create a system for licensing growers and retailers and for taxing the sale of pot, while exempting those who grow their own in limited amounts.

It is the by-products that interested some parents who testified, including Heidi Rayl. She tells the committee Kelly’s bill would allow her to make a compound to treat her son, Zayden.

“He’s four years old and has a genetic condition that is very rare called MCSZ,” Rayl testified. She says the disorder has many symptoms, the most severe of which is intractable epilepsy. “I look at my son’s suffering and it breaks my heart that I can’t fix it. I can’t fix his boo-boo.”

Three law enforcement officer associations testified against the proposal.

Jason Grellner with the Missouri Narcotics Officers Association tells a House Committee the state should proceed slowly with the pursuit of medical applications of marijuana.

He argues one of the unforseen consequences of marijuana legalization in other states has involved children getting a hold of products made with THC, the primary psychoactive agent in marijuana.

“When we have individuals that are making brownies, carrot cake, cookies, peanut butter, granola bars, ice cream … how’s a child supposed to know the difference between a brownie that isn’t infused with THC and one that is?” Grellner asks the committee. “You have marketing of ring pops, of marijuana and THC-infused sodas with pictures of horses and apes.”

Michael Halford with the Troopers’ Association shares the concern that because legalization would make marijuana more available, it would result in more children getting their hands on it.

Halford asks the committee to consider, “We’ve failed the children in keeping alcohol and tobacco out of their hands. How are we going to actually keep marijuana out of their hands?”

The committee has not held a vote on the proposal.

The company behind the compulsively addictive cellphone game Candy Crush Saga is expected to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it starts publicly trading later this month. Turns out that getting people to spend their subway rides moving three same-colored candies into a row is a very lucrative industry.

Talks of an IPO were first heard last June, but as Aman Shah and Neha Dimri report for Reuters, King Digital Entertainment Plc are looking to capitalize on a strong demand for technology investments. Facebook's recent $16 billion purchase of mobile messaging app WhatsApp and Twitter’s successful IPO in November have boosted confidence — but just don't mention Zynga.

Shah and Dimri also report that the King IPO could prompt other technology companies, many of whom are known for their “disruptive” ethos, including Spotify, AirBnB, and Square, the payments company, to go public sooner rather than later.

King Digital, who announced they were going public in February, has 180 games in 14 languages for Facebook, mobile platforms and their website. But its main draw is Candy Crush, which was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and has been downloaded more than 500 million times since it launched in 2012.###3106||Empty###3107||The Malaysian ambassador to China has received confirmation from the Malaysian military that it detected a rogue jet just an hour after flight MH370 vanished - but denied rumours it was shot down.

Iskandar Sarudin, confronted by the frustrated families of Chinese passengers, called up a military source to dispel rumours on social media that the aircraft was shot down - and that it could have been the Beijing-bound flight.

Sarudin was bombarded by questions from concerned relatives at a Malaysia Airlines briefing at Beijing's Lido Hotel.

Watch: Malaysia says hunt for jet not in disarray

The military confirmed spotting the unidentified aircraft on its radar about an hour and 20 minutes after MH370's signal went cold on Saturday, the ambassador said.

A Malaysia Airlines representative at the same briefing said the military had not determined if it was the missing plane.

The ambassador was quoted as saying the military official had said the rogue aircraft was not deemed a threat, otherwise it would have notified its response teams.

The press was barred from the briefing, but some Chinese correspondents managed to get accounts and pictures from the event. They posted these on their newspapers' microblogs.

The families also asked about the mental health of the pilots, Captain Zaharie Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. Shah had more than 18,300 hours of flight experience, while Hamid had 2,800 hours.

Malaysia Airlines said its investigation of the crew had not brought up anything unusual.

The airline representative also shed some light on the mystery of the continuing connection to some MH370 passengers' mobile phones. He said that at least two numbers could be reached and that the ringtones could be heard when dialled, but no one picked up.

But Malaysia Airlines said they had yet to confirm if the calls were actually connecting to the phones or if they were being redirected to telecom providers' servers.

Asked if the military radar had not been fully activated, the airline representative said the military could not track flight MH370's signal after it vanished from civil aviation radar.

Accounts described the meeting as tense. The aggrieved relatives stopped the officials proceeding to a media briefing until their questions were answered.###3108||Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.

Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.

In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China’s exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy.

In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.

The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.

“It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table,” said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. “We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it’s) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It’s going to be par for the course for this year.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.

The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.

The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.

“The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China,” said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. “Expectations have been coming down, but the numbers have been disappointing even those reduced expectations.”

Despite the disappointing data from China, some market watchers anticipate that last week’s gains will continue.

The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of unusually severe winter weather, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also helped encourage investors.

“In general, I think the market will move past the poor China export numbers fairly quickly,” said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. “There’s still a lot of fundamental support for the S&P at this particular range.”

Chalupnik also anticipates Monday’s decline isn’t telling of the market’s trajectory for the week ahead, barring more fallout from Russia’s deployment of troops in Ukraine.

“My guess is the market moves ever so slightly higher this week,” he said. “The trend is still up. We really haven’t seen anything to break that trend.”

Monday marked the fifth anniversary of the current bull market in stocks.

The bankruptcy filing on Monday comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. The Melville, N.Y., company still has about 800 locations globally, half of those in North America.

The pizza and pasta chain says it is filing for bankruptcy reorganization protection after an effort to revitalize the chain’s image with new recipes and ovens apparently didn’t work.

The pizza chain isn’t alone in hurting from the decline in traffic at shopping malls. Earlier this year, the owner of Hot Dot on a Stick also filed for bankruptcy protection, citing the negative impact from the trend.

There is one Sbarro location in Maine, at the Kennebunk Travel Plaza at Mile 25 on Interstate 95. There previously were locations at both the Maine Mall and Bangor Mall, but both have shuttered.

Sbarro is working to balance out its portfolio of mall-based stores with a new concept called “Pizza Cucinova” that lets people build their own pizzas, company spokesman Jonathan Dedmon said in an email. There are two locations of the new restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, and a third planned for Cincinnati in the summer, Dedmon said.

Sbarro is also trying to update its image for serving re-heated pizza at a time when people are increasingly reaching for foods they feel are fresh and wholesome. Dedmon said the chain has been “emphasizing freshness and quality” of its pizza.

Sbarro first filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain’s image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn’t take hold.

The company says its latest strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will slash debt by more than 80 percent and improve its profitability. It said its filing is designed to “allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy” as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.

The minutes did not say that any violations of compliance were endorsed.



Carney's questioning by politicians about the issue is a further blow for the bank after public criticism of its role in the scandal surrounding the rigging of the key bank rate LIBOR.



The global banking sector's reputation is now undergoing another battering amid global investigations into foreign exchange markets following reports that traders were colluding to manipulate the daily foreign exchange rates.

The Treasury Select Committee's Chair Andrew Tyrie has expressed concern about the speed with which the Bank of England's Court of Directors – which is responsible for managing its affairs – responded to concerns.



The court asked its Oversight Committee to investigate the allegations just last week – despite concerns dating back to last October "or possibly earlier," according to Tyrie.



"The Bank of England's foreign exchange dealers seem to have had knowledge that there was manipulation going on, but this wasn't passed on to the regulator – despite the bank being a member of the regulation community," committee member Mark Garnier MP told CNBC. "We need to get to the bottom of how this break down occurred."



Garnier stressed that London's reputation as "the center of the world for financial services" was at risk – which is especially important given the ongoing overhaul in regulation across the world.



"There is a huge amount of change to financial regulation going on at the moment, and we want to be leaders in this change," he said. "If we now discover a problem with a prime regulator's (the Bank of England) conduct, this will this damage our input in the world's regulatory change."

Carney took over at the Bank of England in the summer of 2013, years before the alleged currency market manipulation took place. Allegations that bank officials knew first surfaced months ago, however, so there are likely to be questions asked about why he did not immediately order an inquiry.



"This situation tests the mettle of an individual. He has to demonstrate that he is taking control of this situation and convince everyone – including the international forex market - that he's doing the right thing," Garnier added.###3113||Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption CMC Markets' senior analyst Michael Hewson: "If Vodafone is to survive... it really needs to take on fixed line infrastructure"

Vodafone has agreed to buy Spanish cable operator Ono for 7.2bn euros ($10bn; £6bn), in deal aimed at expanding its interests in Europe.

Ono, which is private equity-owned, offers cable TV and internet services and has 1.9 million customers in Spain.

Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao said the deal was "an attractive value creation opportunity".

The deal comes just six months after Vodafone bought a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel.

Vodafone has said it plans to spend up to £25bn of the £84bn it generated from the sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless on investment in its core European networks.

Before the Vodafone deal, Ono's private equity owners had been planning to float the company on the Madrid stock exchange.

Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of Ono's board of directors, said the enlarged business would help to "drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry".

Peregrine & Black analyst Markus Huber said the deal would put Vodafone in a better position to compete with rivals such as Telefonica and Orange.

"It follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general, which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services," he added.

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor, agreed the purchase was a "shrewd strategic move" for Vodafone, noting that the deal would provide it with the fixed-line operation it currently lacked in Spain.###3114||* Spain, Portugal, Ireland sales growth in double digits

* Toyota, GM, Ford, Renault lead February’s increase

* French auto sales dip 1.4 pct; Germany’s underperform

By Agnieszka Flak

MILAN, March 18 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 7.6 percent in February, as a gradual economic recovery in Portugal, Spain and Italy boosted demand for mass-market brands, industry data showed on Tuesday.

New passenger-car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association trading bloc rose for the sixth straight month to 894,730 vehicles in February from 831,371 in February a year ago, according to data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA).

Europe’s car industry endured a six-year slump, with auto sales falling to a two-decade low, as austerity-hit consumers cut back on expensive purchases. Now the market is starting to grow again.

“As the year progresses, we would expect the car market continuing to pick up because the economy is starting to move in the right direction,” said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive. Selling rates in western Europe clawed their way back to mid-2012 levels, he said.

“People are going to feel more confident to make that big-ticket purchase, such as a car, that they’ve been holding off on because of the concerns over their employment prospects and their income,” he said.

At the Geneva auto show earlier this month, executives said they were encouraged by the recovery in crisis-hit European countries, although they were worried that volatile emerging markets could overshadow the gains.

Registrations in Germany, the top car market, underperformed the regional trend, with a 4.3 percent increase, and fell by 1.4 percent in Europe’s second-biggest car market, France. But sales grew by double digits in some states most hit by the crisis.

Sales grew 17.8 percent in Spain, 40.2 percent in Portugal and 20.6 percent in Ireland, signalling that a fragile recovery in the region was gaining strength. In Italy, the region’s fourth-biggest market, sales grew 8.6 percent as the country recovers from its longest recession in 70 years.

“We keep forecasting an ongoing improvement of the underlying sales trend,” ISI Group said in a note. “In addition, we keep highlighting improved vehicle pricing in tandem with better residual values and sales channel mix.”

Sales at Renault Group jumped 11.5 percent, boosted mainly by a 33.6 percent surge in registrations of its no-frills Dacia brand. Ford sales were up 11.3 percent. Toyota Group, the world’s biggest-selling car maker, posted a 14 percent increase, and General Motors saw sales go up 12.3 percent, boosted by a 15.6 percent increase in registrations of its Opel- and Vauxhall-branded vehicles.

Germany’s Volkswagen group, Europe’s biggest carmaker by volume, posted a 7.2 percent rise, helped by a 21.5 increase at its value brand Skoda, a 15.7 percent jump in Seat sales and an 11.8 percent gain at its premium brand, Audi. VW’s performance was weighed down by a 0.8 percent decline in sales at its namesake brand.

French carmaker PSA lost some market share in February. Its overall sales grew 3.5 percent, supported by an increase in registrations of its Peugeot brand, but sales of Citroen-branded cars were roughly flat year-on-year.

The long-awaited revival of the European market seems to be on track, with almost all countries and manufacturers performing better. But industry players urge caution, pointing out the gain comes from historic lows. In Italy, for example, car sales are recovering from levels last seen in the 1970s.

“Sales have effectively been growing, but discounting practices have been following a very similar path, it seems,” Carlos Da Silva, an analyst with market researchers IHS Automotive, said in a note. “This would tend to indicate that the overall situation remains more tense than it might appear.”###3115||(Newser) – President Obama had little trouble garnering young people's support for his election—but when it comes to youth backing for the Affordable Care Act, it's a different story. Young enrollees are essential to the functioning of ObamaCare, but as of the end of February, just 1.08 million had signed up, the White House says. That's 25% of total enrollees; the administration needs the figure to be 40%, it has said. "If the proportion doesn’t improve significantly, the result likely will be fatal for the Affordable Care Act," writes Dana Milbank in the Washington Post.

Why have young people become detached from the Obama presidency? Milbank has some theories. For one thing, they were "disillusioned" by the lack of a "public option" in health care reform. And more broadly, millenials have an "inability … to remain attached to a cause. The generation that brought Obama to power is connected online but has no loyalty to institutions"—like political parties, unions, churches, and the White House, Milbank writes. "The organizational structure they’re growing up in is so weak," says an expert on young people's civic involvement. "There aren’t very many durable institutions that can capitalize on their enthusiasm. They’re being asked to do it themselves, online, and it’s a tall order." Click for the full piece.

But governments and regulators will have the last word on bitcoin’s future prospects.

After a year of wild price swings–from $13.50 per coin in January 2013 to $1,242 in November and now back to around $500–and the recent closure of Mt. Gox in Japan, until recently bitcoin’s largest exchange, the bitcoin currency system looks far too volatile to become a universal currency any time soon. However, some economists and venture capitalists believe that a digital monetary system has enough practical advantages that sooner or later, your money may be even more virtual than it is now. What is the future of bitcoin?

Invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of an unknown cryptographer, bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer payment system that enables people to make transactions without any recourse to a government-issued currency.

But like the ones and zeros that make up the binary language of the digital world, the views of what that future might look like tend to run toward extremes. On the con side, science fiction writer and economic blogger Charles Stross imagines that a bitcoin economy would starve government services by reducing government’s ability to tax, make it easier to trade all kinds of illegal things, and in the end, make “a sub-Saharan kleptocracy look like a socialist utopia”.

Bitcoin boosters, on the other hand, see it as a key technology in building a more prosperous world in which capital moves with less friction, individuals are completely free to make their own economic choices, and money is no longer a government monopoly. As one bitcoin site puts it, “No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.”

Bitcoin Pluses and Minuses

If the advantages and the disadvantages sound quite similar, that’s no accident. Many of bitcoin’s most committed supporters have a Libertarian bent, and argue that apart from a few limited functions, the world could be run better if people were left largely to their own devices.

A world dominated by a digital, non-state currency, would be “a world of strong privacy,” says David D. Friedman, a law professor at Santa Clara University in California and son of the late free market economist Milton Friedman.

Strong privacy would share many of the characteristics of the old Swiss bank system that enabled people to hold assets anonymously–a good thing say, if you’re trying to escape from the Nazis, but not so good if you’re a citizen in a developing country trying to find your country’s vanished oil revenues.

Taxation would be more difficult in a world of strong privacy. “It’s really hard to tax something you can’t see,” Friedman says. It would also be a lot more difficult to watch what people are doing.

One possible preview of the dark side of that future came in November, when the US Justice Department disclosed the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged founder of Silk Road, a kind of underworld eBay, in San Francisco. Prosecutors allege that the secret website had made it possible for people to buy and sell drugs, arms, and a variety of illicit services, all with bitcoins.

It would also make it more difficult for governments to clamp down on organizations for ideological reasons. Eli Dourado, a research fellow at the technology policy program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says a virtual currency would also make it a lot harder for governments stop organizations they don’t like. Wikileaks, for instance, was starved of funds because the US government made it impossible for people to donate money to the controversial group.

Bitcoin could lead to considerable disruption in the financial world as well. For example, bitcoin could be a boon for migrant workers, who now must spend a considerable part of their income simply sending their hard-earned money home. Migrant workers send more than $500 billion home a year, according to World Bank figures, and currently pay high fees on those remittances: a 2010 United Nations report noted that they pay as much as $18 on a $200 transfer by Western Union or the other two leading operators.

However, as radical as some of these changes might sound, Dourado argues that people have overlooked even more revolutionary implications of bitcoin. “I think bitcoin is actually a kind of base-layer protocol in the same way that TCP/IP is for the internet,” he says.

“Bitcoin is programmable money,” Dourado explains. As a ledger-based system, a bitcoin could be attached to some real property. For example, a single bitcoin might be tied to a title deed, making it possible to buy a car without ever meeting the seller. Or it might be programmed to perform an if-then statement, he says, making it possible to create Kickstarter-like but entirely decentralized markets.

Dourado’s view isn’t unique. Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, has argued in the New York Times that bitcoin is at a similar stage of development to the personal computer in 1975 or the internet in 1993, and represents “a sweeping vista of opportunity”.

Andreessen and number of other Silicon Valley venture capitalists are already trying to stake claims in that sweeping vista. In 2013, venture capitalists invested $74 million in 40 bitcoin-related ventures, $50 million of that in the fourth quarter, according to CB Insights, a venture capital data analytics firm.

Bigger players may be trying to get in on this virtual gold rush as well. In December, eBay filed a patent application for something that sounds a lot like electronic money and could be sent by one person to another, “a Gift Token… that can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product.” Tokens could also be limited geographically, according to the application, to a particular city or region.

Not-so-Brave New World

But whether bitcoin itself is part of that digital monetary future remains to be seen. Enough legal problems have already cropped up that the new currency could end up being the Napster of digital money–the pioneer that paves the way for a more government-friendly alternative. It has been especially difficult for bitcoin in China.



Government officials in Europe and elsewhere won’t sit back forever if the use of digital money grows, predicts Robert Pargac, Director of Global Investigations and Compliance for Navigant Consulting in New York. Should the value of bitcoins remain volatile, regulators could ultimately classify them as a type of commodity, he says.

“If [bitcoin proponents] really want a secretive, anonymous, free-floating market-driven virtual currency that’s not regulated, that’s simply not going to happen,” says Pargac. “It’s not going to be good for the consumer, it won’t be good for the economy and regulators and law enforcement will not permit it. They will find it and they will close it down.”###3118||Empty###3119||###3120||Can a gaming company built on the back of one gigantic hit be worth 80 percent of gaming titan Electronic Arts? Candy Crush maker King Digital thinks so.

King revealed in an SEC filing on Wednesday that it and its current shareholders are looking to raise a combined $532 million in its imminent IPO, which would value the Dublin, Ireland-based company at around $7.6 billion. At that valuation, King would be worth about four-fifths of Electronic Arts, which has a market cap of $9.3 billion, and 1.6x of one-time gaming darling Zynga.

King is selling 15.5 million shares in the offering, while its current shareholders are offering an additional 6.7 million shares. Each share is expected to be valued at between $21 and $24, meaning King could bring in as much as $372 million at the top end of the range.

The company, which also produces games like Pet Heroes Saga and Farm Heroes Saga, posted profits of $568 million in 2013 on revenue of $1.88 million billion. But its reliance on the success of Candy Crush — 78 percent of revenue came from the one game — is a potential problem, as is the fact revenue fell to $602 million in the fourth quarter from $621 million in the prior quarter.

Still, Candy Crush’s daily active user count rose from 93 million in December to 97 million in February, according to the new filing.

Upon completion of the IPO, private equity fund Apax will own 44.8 percent of outstanding shares, while Index Ventures will hold 7.8 percent.###3121||In the last week of February, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged concern over the strength of the economy in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. If you assumed that one of the nation's top economic officials expressing doubts about economic growth would be unsettling to the stock market, you would be wrong.

In love with low interest rates

Stocks instead rallied on news of Yellen's testimony -- such is the upside-down logic of stock prices and interest rates.

The reason the stock market liked Yellen's comments was that it raised the possibility that the Fed would slow the tapering of its quantitative easing program, thereby holding long-term interest rates down for a while longer.

Low rates can be stimulative. Low interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, and thus easier to spend. However, whether Fed policy has succeeded in stimulating the economy is a matter of some debate. The Bureau of Economic Advisors recently downgraded its estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 to a real annual rate of 2.4 percent. This is quite a drop from the original estimate of 3.2 percent, and an even bigger plunge from the third quarter's growth rate of 4.1 percent. Once again, the economy has failed to sustain any momentum. Low rates make stocks look good by comparison. Technically, this has to do with using a lower interest rate to discount the value of future earnings. More intuitively, any investor can relate to the fact that low rates drive people toward the stock market. Savings account rates are near zero, and Treasury bond yields are less than 4 percent. Among conventional asset classes, stocks are the only option offering a solid chance for growth and beating inflation.

Yield comparison

The market has two reasons to applaud low interest rates:

The relative attractiveness of stocks is illustrated when you look at stocks in terms of yield. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 is about 2 percent -- certainly much better savings account rates and even most long-term CD rates , though not as high as long bond yields. However, since stocks do not pay out all of their earnings, stock analysts generally look at earnings yield (essentially, the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) more than dividend yield in valuing stocks.

Currently, the earnings yield on stocks is 5.7 percent, much higher than bank rates or bond yields. At the end of the 1990s, the earnings yield on stocks was 3.3 percent. At the time, 30-year Treasury yields were about 6.4 percent; today Treasury yields are down around 3.8 percent.###3122||Empty###3123||Washington - US Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker late on Sunday that had been seized earlier this month at a Libyan port by three armed men, the US Department of Defence said.

No one was hurt in the boarding operation, approved by US President Barack Obama, requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters south-east of Cyprus, said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.###3124||The United States along with allied governments is considering the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. It is a strategy that trails skeptical question marks. The historical record tells us that sanctions rarely are effective. They can cause much pain and suffering but do not change the policies of governments as intended. From Japan before Pearl Harbor to Cold War China, to North Korea, Iraq and Iran in more recent times, their ineffectualness has been demonstrated. South Africa is the exception -- as were the conditions there.

The willfulness of states to act in accordance with their self-defined basic interests is the main reason for the recurrent failure of sanctions. This is especially true of authoritarian regimes that have the means to contain social unrest. There also are economic factors at work. The essential nature of economic relations is that they are the expression of the parties' mutual interests (except in the case of slavery or other forms of coerced employment). That is to say, they entail mutual gain - even if the benefits are unequal or asymmetrical and leave one party feeling the outcomes as unfair. Trade dealings certainly fall within this category. And it is on matters of trade that American policy currently is focused. For it is far harder to impose curbs on financial transactions, e.g. freezing assets or denying access to banking facilities. The latter require near unanimity among countries where financial institutions are chartered. Already, we have learned that Great Britain has decided to resist the proposed imposition of financial sanctions out of fear for their impact on the City of London which is the foundation stone of the British economy.

Commodity trade with Russia is the center of attention - for obvious reasons. The Russian economy is heavily dependent on the export of natural resources, oil and natural gas above all. They provide the bulk of the country's foreign exchange earnings, employ a large fraction of the nation's industrial workers, and are the main source of the state's tax revenues. The numbers paint a striking portrait o the Russian economy.

Russia is the second-largest producer of dry natural gas and third-largest liquid fuels producer in the world; oil and gas revenues account for more than 50% of the federal budget revenues. Russia's economic growth continues to be driven by energy exports, given its high oil and gas production and the elevated prices for those commodities. Oil and gas revenues accounted for 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports in 2012, according to PFC Energy. Russia was the world's third-largest producer of oil (after Saudi Arabia and the United States) Preliminary data for 2013 show that Russia still is the third-ranked producer of total liquids, with average production at 10.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) through September 2013. Russia was the second-largest producer of natural gas in 2012 (second to the United States).

Russia has roughly 7.2 million bbl/d of total liquid fuels available for export. The large majority of Russian exports (84%) went to European countries, particularly Germany, Netherlands, and Poland. Around 18% of Russia's oil exports were destined for Asia, while the remainder went mostly to the Americas. Russia's crude oil exports to North America and South America have been largely displaced by increases in crude oil production in the United States and Canada. More than 80% of Russia's oil is exported via the Transneft pipeline system, and the remainder is shipped via rail and on vessels that load at independently-owned terminals.

Russia also exports fairly sizeable volumes of oil products. Russia exported about 1.2 million bbl/d of fuel oil and an additional 889,000 bbl/d of diesel in 2012. It exported smaller volumes of gasoline (52,000 bbl/d) and liquefied petroleum gas (56,000 bbl/d) during the same year.

Natural gas exports

Russia sends about 76% of its natural gas exports to customers in Western Europe, with Germany, Turkey, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom receiving the bulk of them. Smaller volumes of natural gas are also shipped via the Gazprom pipeline network to Austria, Finland, and Greece.

Europe is Russia's main energy export market. 75% goes to Western Europe, with Germany being the biggest importer, while 24% goes to Eastern Europe. Fully 25% of the European Union members' total natural gas consumption is met by Russia. This energy symbiosis dates from the early 1980s when the EU and the then Soviet Union entered into a collaborate project to construct a natural gas pipeline. Early on, the project figured in a major diplomatic dispute. In the wake of the Kremlin inspired crackdown on Poland's Solidarity movement, the United States' urged its suspension as a way to penalize Moscow. Western European governments united in opposition to the American plan. They argued forcefully that the criticality of Russian natural gas to their economies meant that disruption or prolonged delay would severely hamper growth. Moreover, a primary justification for the collaborative deal was to reduce the degree of energy dependence on the turbulent Middle East. The economic pain inflicted by the 1973-74 embargo on oil sales by the Arab members of OPEC at the time of the Yom Kippur War had left a searing memory. It provided the impetus for devising an energy strategy that diversified sources. Hence, the European conflict with the United States as to what were appropriate instruments of influence to be deployed against the Soviet Union.

A similar situation may now be presenting itself. Although the Obama administration has not yet called for a boycott of Russian energy exports, it may look in that direction given the unlikelihood that other trade sanctions will dissuade Vladimir Putin from continuing to pursue as assertive policy in Ukraine. Just as the Cameron government in Britain shies away from financial sanctions due to the deleterious effect that they would have on the economy (and his political prospects in next year's elections), so too are all European leaders sensitive to the high price that their countries would pay were they to interfere with the mutually beneficial energy commerce they have with Russia.

There is no doubt that on some objective scale of measurement, Russia stands to suffer more economic loss from such a disruption than does Europe. However, economic sensitivity per se does not translate into commensurate vulnerability to the pressure exerted by economic sanctions. There are crucial intervening variables of a political nature. They concern the strength of governmental leadership, how responsive it is to public sentiment, the means at their disposition to contain or repress dissent, and their ability to arouse a nationalist response. Success in fostering the feeling that the motherland is being mistreated and disrespected by foreign powers can strengthen the collective resolve not to give in to economic sanctions whatever the price paid.

A New U.S. Strategy

The current structure of the international energy market is unfavorable to any Western policy that aims to a) reduce Europe's dependence on the energy imports from Russia, and b) thereby, to reduce Moscow's leverage while increasing that that of the United States and its allies. This circumstance has prompted Washington officials to draw up plans whereby the logic of the markets can be reversed. Their centerpiece is the expansion of natural gas production via fracking and other non-conventional methods, an emphasis on exports to Europe that would markedly reduce reliance on Russian sources, and the promotion of fracking in Ukraine and Poland.

This long-term plan acquired immediacy with the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine. Many in Washington were looking anxiously for methods to shift the balance of influence between Russia and the West. Freeing Europe from the energy leverage exercised by Moscow has struck many as an attractive possibility. A New York Times lead editorial opined that the Energy Department should "speed up its review of export applications, and Congress could help by easing restrictions on exports."

Others go further. "In WW II, we were the arsenal of democracy; I think we're going to be the arsenal of energy" so proclaims the former director of energy issues at the NSC, Robert McNally. Increased supplies from the United States are creating "a radically changed market" that will undercut Russia's influence, according to Carlos Pascal who heads the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources (and former ambassador to Ukraine. The Bureau was set up in 2011 and with a staff of 85 is dedicated to exploiting the American energy boom to strengthen its geopolitical influence. Curbing Russia's own use of the energy instrument was the primary objective from the outset. Energy, in short, was one element in the United States' grand strategy of weakening Russia as a player on the international scene and curtailing its global influence. This has been the prevailing view ever since Vladimir Putin began to demonstrate his goal of reestablishing Russia as an autonomous power in world affairs.

Minimizing the United States' own dependence on oil from the Middle East has been the second foreign policy consideration.

The key to doing so is the building of export capacity - transporting Canadian oil via the proposed Keystone pipeline, extending natural gas pipelines, and constructing facilities on the Gulf Coast for Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). The national security factor has figured prominently in the Obama administration's deliberations about the cost/benefits of investing in these projects - along with environmental concerns, and the loss to American natural gas users of the present price advantage they derive from domestic production.*

The strategy has included an aggressive campaign to promote fracking in Western as well as Eastern Europe. That has meant lobbying governments, industry and public opinion. Tangible results have been modest to date. Fracking in Ukraine and Poland is in the cards but a number of Western European countries, e.g. Germany and France, have imposed outright prohibitions, while the British government's planned limited trial runs have met with fierce resistance. The hope in Washington is that the Ukraine crisis will spur actions in both the United States and in European capitals to develop production and international trade.

The effects of this on the immediate situation will be negligible. There is no spigot that can be turned on. It will be years before the United States will be technically able to export natural gas. By that time, the Ukraine's fate will be determined one way or another. Moreover, even over the long-term there are significant obstacles to a meaningful transformation of the European energy picture. First, the political opposition to fracking in Western Europe seems to be a fixed element not susceptible to change due to events in Ukraine. Second, leading governments there are reluctant to make the major capital investments in port and transport facilities that would be required to handle very large LNG imports from North America.

Third, the level of concern there about Russia using energy exports as a political tool against them is quite low. For their view of Putin's ambitions is guarded; they reject the notion favored in Washington that the West is facing a strategic challenge something like that of the Soviet Union in the old days. Their response to Hillary Clinton's alarmist cry that Putin was behaving like Hitler in the 1930s has been to view it derisively. Fourth, the Western Europeans' main interest in natural gas imports from the United States, such as it is, is commercial. They wish to avoid having their industries handicapped in competition with their American rivals by wide differentiations in cost of natural gas. At present, there is little evidence of their suffering much from that seeming disadvantage.

Conclusion

At the present, it is highly unlikely that the Western governments will seek to use energy commerce with Russia as an instrument of leverage with Russia. The cost-benefit calculations that lead to devalue that tactic conceivably could change were the crisis to deepen. A move by Russia into the mainly Russian speaking eastern part of Ukraine in an attempt to impose a permanent division of the country would raise the stakes immeasurably. This good reason, though, to downplay the possibility of that happening since the wider implications of such an escalation do not correspond to Russia's national interests. The downside of a calculated escalation heavily outweigh any benefits that the Kremlin may reasonably envisage.

The United States will be unable to export substantial quantities of natural gas until late in the decade. Its present capacity is only 5 bcm with another 20 bcm under construction. Expanding export terminals is a long and costly process. That is one reason why, as the International Energy Agency has explained "Gas remains stubbornly resistant to globalisation....downstream markets, industry and regulatory structure retain their region-specific natures." The report goes on to say: "In Europe, persistent macro-economic weakness, low carbon prices and non-market-based renewable policies squeeze gas between cheap coal and growing renewables." (IEA GAS Medium-Term Market Report 2013)

At the receiving end, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import capacity additions have slowed to a crawl. "The outlook remains relatively bleak for the....LNG terminals currently at the planning stage." Moreover, LNG project costs have been steadily rising over the past few years and all are typically completed a year or more behind schedule.###3125||Empty###3126||Empty###3127||Empty###3128||Images released by China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense that it says are three large floating objects in an area where missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 vanished. Credit: AAP/SASTIND China has released several satellite images its officials say could be wreckage from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 with 239 people onboard.

If they are proved to be true it shows how remote sensing satellites can play an important role in locating the wreckage of a crashed plane. It can be done within a couple of hours after the accident if multiple high-resolution satellites are used.

About satellites

Remote sensing satellites can be broadly classified into two categories – optical and radar satellites.

Optical satellites can now deliver unclassified images at a resolution of half a metre while radar satellites can provide unclassified images at one metre resolution.

Metallic structures such as plane wreckage can produce strong return on radar images, making them easily visible. Satellite imaging radar can also "see" through any cloud and can take images day and night.

According to China's satellite images – taken over the suspected crash area a day after flight MH370 went missing on Saturday – the largest object shown is about 24m by 22m. This is clearly large enough to be imaged by both optical and radar satellites.

It should be noted from the images that the object is closely surrounded by cloud. Any potential wreckage would not be spotted by optical satellite if it were covered by cloud but it would still be visible on a radar image.

That's why it makes sense to use both optical and radar satellites in any search for the location of plane wreckage.

Satellite remote sensing has many advantages over conventional air and sea search using ships and aircraft.

The satellites orbit around Earth at a height between 200km to 900km and can cover a large area, typically 100km by 100km (100,000 square kilometres – about the size of Cuba) or even 500km by 500km (250,000 square kilometres – about the size of the UK), with a single image collected in only a few seconds.

It would take an aircraft between 1.5 and 34 hours to cover the same area. A ship will take much longer.

So it is much more cost effective to use remote sensing satellites to search over large areas.

Another advantage of satellites is that once in orbit the cameras and radar sensors on board are always on standby. They can be switched on immediately, as soon as the space agencies are informed of an accident, and be pointed straight at the area around the last known coordinates of the aircraft.

This also makes them much quicker to respond to incidents such as the air crash than the air and sea search vessels.

Another advantage is that satellites can take images globally without the issue around border protection so it is much easier to use them in international search.

Any limits?

Although the remote sensing satellites have the potential for global coverage some do have difficulty in imaging the two poles. That's because they use near-polar orbits and not all of them have side-looking capability – they mostly look only down.

If an aircraft goes missing in the mountains, there is also a good chance that any wreckage may be hidden under the forest canopy. Although long wavelength radars can penetrate tree canopy, they may still have difficulty in seeing through the dense tropical forest.

In contrast, the open sea is a more favourable environment for searching a missing aircraft with satellite remote sensing, because the main features in a satellite image will be just sea water and the plane wreckage – there is less chance of confusing any wreckage with any other targets, such as trucks, trains or farm houses, as in the case of a plane crash on land.

Satellites in other disasters

Since 2008 the Geodesy and Earth Observing Systems group (GEOS), at the UNSW School of Civil & Environmental Engineering has responded, in near real-time, to a range of natural disasters using both optical and radar satellite remote sensing.

These events include major earthquakes in China and New Zealand, bushfire in Victoria and floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

The team has repeatedly demonstrated that intelligence such as ground deformation, fire and flood extent can be extracted and delivered to relevant authorities within two hours of satellite image capture.

Investors remained cautious on Monday, as Russia began to amass troops in Crimea ahead of the region’s “election” on March 16. China helped contribute to the gloom, as Saturday’s report that Chinese exports sank in February stoked anxiety about the state of the global economy, sending stocks moderately lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 34 points to finish Monday’s trading session at 16,418 for a 0.21 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) dipped 0.05 percent to 1,877.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) advanced 0.08 percent to finish at 3,706. The Russell 2000 (IWM) declined 0.23 percent to 1,200.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined $1.11 (1.02 percent) to $107.35/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $1.60 (0.12 percent) to $1,339.80 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector got stuck in traffic during Monday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average declined 0.16 percent to 7,580 (IYT).

In Japan, disappointing economic data upstaged the exchange rate for the yen as the dominant factor in stock market activity on Monday. The nation’s GDP expansion during the fourth quarter of 2013 fell short of expectations, reaching only 0.70 percent. The result indicated a retreat from the preliminary estimate of 1.0 percent growth and it fell short of economists’ expectations for 0.90 percent expansion.

Japan’s Ministry of Finance had more bad news on Monday. The nation’s current account deficit expanded to the equivalent of over $15 billion – its highest level in almost 30 years. Meanwhile, the exchange rate for the yen remained relatively unchanged, trading at 103.05 per dollar during the last ten minutes of Monday’s trading session in Tokyo (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 1.01 percent to 15,120 (EWJ).

In China, Saturday’s release of the nation’s trade balance report brought bad news. The nation’s exports decreased by 18.1 percent on a year-over-year basis in February, resulting in a trade deficit. The awful report is expected to put pressure on the People’s Bank of China to weaken the yuan. The report re-ignited concerns about the state of the global economy, sending the spot price of copper 1.62 percent lower (after a 4.27 percent nosedive on Friday) to $3.03 per pound.

The Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.86 percent to 1,999 (FXI). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.75 percent to 22,264 (EWH).

The bad news from China caused mining companies to drag the major European stock indices lower. Ongoing tension over Russia’s plans for Crimea kept European investors in a risk-averse mood. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Monday’s session with a 0.08 percent dip to 3,092.79 – remaining just a whisker above its 50-day moving average of 3,092.38. Its Relative Strength Index is 48.12 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,827 on Monday, despite taking a 0.05 percent dip to 1,877. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) declined from 66.40 to 65.92. The MACD and the signal line are both climbing above the zero line, suggesting that the S&P could resume its advance during the immediate future.

On Monday, four sectors advanced and five sectors declined. The industrial sector took the hardest hit, falling 0.43 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.27%

Technology: (XLK): -0.16%

Industrials (XLI): -0.43%

Materials: (XLB): -0.08%

Energy (XLE): +0.16%

Financials: (XLF): +0.04%

Utilities (XLU): -0.25%

Health Care: (XLV): +0.42%

Consumer Staples (XLP): +0.09%

Bottom line: Russia’s Crimean adventure combined with disappointing export data from China to send stocks moderately lower on Monday.

(Memphis) It's part of the latest push by the Obama Administration to get people to sign up for insurance.

Well known celebrities such as NBA legends Alonzo Mourning and Magic Johnson are appearing in ads to get people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, but are large numbers of Memphians enrolling?

The Church Health Center in Memphis provides affordable healthcare for the low-wage working, uninsured. Marvin Stockwell is communications director.

"The majority of our patients in Memphis won't receive a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act because Tennessee did not, at least so far, didn't expand its Medicaid plan," Stockwell said.

But according to a Bankrate.com report 41 percent of uninsured Americans plan to remain uninsured.

"Frankly, I think that's when we'll see more acceptance is when people begin hearing their friends have had a good experience. Why are people electing to stay uninsured? It has a lot to do with the affordability issue," Stockwell said.

The Bankrate.com report says more than 40 percent say health insurance is still too expensive and they'd rather pay a fine and many are still unaware of healthcare subsidies.

Christ Community Health Services also provides health care for Memphians and Shelby Countians who are uninsured.

Amanda Chandler is director of population health at Christ Community, "We've seen an increase since October since the opening of the Marketplace."

She says despite the media push, it's unfortunate many still have misconceptions about the Affordable Care Act.

"I'm not sure why everyone would not be signing up for insurance. I think a lot of is just education that need to continue surround healthcare.gov," Chandler said.

Christ Community will offer a healthcare enrollment event March 25 at Greater Community Temple Church on Winchester from 11 a.m to 6 p.m.###3133||Empty###3134||It’s here at long, long last! The wedding of the century. Forget those royals, forget that person on TV with a skating rink on her finger: After months of sparring, Men’s Wearhouse is buying Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion. Let’s hope the new couple doesn’t get into another fight over who will provide the tuxedos.

Both companies have played the suitor in the months-long, often kind of nasty battle to buy each other out, but it appears Men’s Wearhouse has emerged the victor. The two rivals announced today that Men’s Wearhouse is forking over about $65 per share to buy Jos. A. Bank, to create a company with expected annual sales of $3.5 billion, reports the Los Angeles Times.

The new couple will be proud parents to 1,700 stores in the U.S. and 23,000 employees once all is said and done, but the two chains will still operate as separate brands.

“We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers,” said Doug Ewert, Men’s Wearhouse chief executive. “Together, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth.”

And Jos. A. Bank won’t be bringing any other companies along, as the company agreed to drop its plans to buy Eddie Bauer as part of the buyout deal.

The two should become one in the next few months if federal officials approve the acquisition.

Men’s Wearhouse to buy Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion after long battle [The Los Angeles Times]###3135||DENVER (AP) — In the world’s first accounting of a recreational pot industry, Colorado officials say the state has made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, the first month of sales.

The tax total reported Monday by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

The state legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January.

Washington state sales begin in the coming months.

The taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. The first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though not all were open in January.###3136||Bloomberg Bill Ackman

There’s more than one way to go after Herbalife /quotes/zigman/361145/delayed /quotes/nls/hlf HLF .

The New York Times has an extensive report about how, after staking $1 billion on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company, Bill Ackman’s activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has been aggressively lobbying to bring the company down.

An investigation by the Times found Ackman’s team has helped organize protests and letter-writing campaigns across the U.S. to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife. Ackman retained the Dewey Square Group, a Washington-based firm that specializes in “grass-roots advocacy,” to influence officials by recruiting surrogates to speak out against Herbalife in emails, letters, tweets or rallies, the Times said.

The report says Ackman’s team has paid civil-rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of people who claim they were victimized by Herbalife. Ackman has argued that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently recruited by Herbalife as distributors – only to find out that there is little money to be made from selling the supplements.

Herbalife has mobilized its own lobbyists to defend itself. Last month, the Times says, the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides to argue against Ackman’s charges.

The Times points out Ackman so far has little to show for his efforts. Herbalife’s stock has risen, in part because billionaire investor Carl Icahn decided to buy a large stake in the company, and regulators lobbied by Ackman haven’t take any formal action against Herbalife.

DENVER, March 10 (Reuters) - Sales of recreational marijuana products in Colorado added more than $2.1 million to state coffers in tax receipts and other fees in the first month retail sales of the drug were allowed, state figures showed on Monday.

The figures, which the Colorado Department of Revenue said were in line with expectations, add to just over $1.4 million collected in taxes and fees on medical marijuana in the state in the same month.

The figures for recreational marijuana include revenues from a 2.9 percent sales tax, a special 10 percent tax on retail pot sales and a 15 percent excise tax imposed on growers, as well as licensing fees, the department said in a statement.

The numbers indicate the state’s recreational pot stores did about $14 million in gross sales for the month.

“We expect clear patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts,” said Barbara Pohl, executive director of the department.

Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the possession and use of small amounts recreational marijuana by adults age 21 or older in 2012, even as marijuana remains an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Colorado opened its retail pot shops in January, and Washington is slated to follow suit later this year.

Under the Colorado legalization law, the first $40 million collected annually from the excise tax is earmarked for school construction and repairs.

The state legislature will decide how to spend any leftover money from marijuana taxes and fees.

Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalization of recreational cannabis, has told lawmakers he would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programs to prevent youths from using the drug.###3141||Source: http://www.guidetobelize.info/de/reisen/belize-zug-eisenbahn-guide.shtml

Chiquita Brands International of the US and Fyffes of Ireland said today they have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction valued at about $1.07bn, that will be the world’s largest banana company.

Chiquita shareholders would own 50.7% of the new company, ChiquitaFyffes, which would have $4.6bn in annual revenue and 32,000 employees globally, Fyffes said.

Wikipedia says Chiquita is the final name in a long list of companies whose ultimate origin was the United Fruit Company, formed in 1899 by the merging of the Boston Fruit Company and various fruit exporting concerns controlled by Minor C. Keith. In 1970 it became the United Brands Company when it was purchased by Eli Black. He outbid two other conglomerates, Zapata Corporation and Textron, for a controlling interest in the company. In fact, that is a condensed version of what has actually happened to United Fruit Co., famed in the U.S. for Chiquita bananas, but known to generations of Latin Americans as "el Pulpo" (the Octopus). In 1990 the company became Chiquita Brands International.

The original “Banana Republic” was Honduras: United Fruit Company had many banana plantations, practically controlled the country economically and got involved in politics as well. Since the term was coined, the word has grown to be applied to any country with unstable, non-democratic governments, and abundant foreign influence, especially in economics. The many countries in Latin America that were dominated by United Fruit Company (UFCo) in the first half of the 20th century certainly fit that definition.

The New York Times wrote in 2008: [Today, “the banana is the world’s fourth major food, after rice, wheat and milk.” But when a Brooklyn-born twentysomething named Minor Keith planted a few banana cuttings next to a railroad track in Costa Rica in the early 1870s, it was virtually unknown outside its native environs. Keith and his partners soon realized how great the potential profits were — especially if, along with growing bananas, they could control railroads, shipping and Central American governments (to that end, Keith married the beautiful daughter of a Costa Rican president). Only then did they set out to turn the banana into a product for the masses. Until its demise a hundred years later, United Fruit controlled as much as 90% of the market.]

Fyffes Announces merger with Chiquita, FY13 numbers in-line: Patrick Higgins of Goodbody comments - - "Fyffes announced this morning that it will combine with Chiquita in a stock for stock transaction. This will result in Fyffes shareholders holding 49.3% of the new entity, ChiquitaFyffes plc. The group will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and domiciled in Ireland. The merger will create the largest player globally, with c.14% market share. The transaction values Fyffes at €1.22, a 38% premium to current levels.

The new company will have an equity value of c. $1.1bn and net debt of $576m. Combined EBITDA is $174m, with an additional $40m expected in synergies. Another synergy benefit from the transaction is on the balance sheet. Chiquita was highly leveraged at 4.7x EBITDA, the new entity will have a more manageable net debt / EBITDA of 2.7x. Fyffes management will have governance of the new entity also, with David McCann to be appointed the new CEO, Tom Murphy the new CFO and Coen Boss the new COO.

Fyffes reported FY13 results this morning with EPS in-line with our forecasts at 8.8c, +3.1% yoy. Sales came in at €839m, +7% , while adjusted EBITA was €32.7m (vs Goodbody €31.9m), at the top end of the guidance range of €29-€34m. Banana sales were up in the year as the group continued to grow volumes; however profits were down slightly due primarily to higher fruit costs. Pricing was weak in H1 although a significant pick up occurred during the summer months due a tightening of supply. Overall pricing increased but insufficiently to offset the continuing rise in fruit costs.

Melons, which is predominantly H1 weighted, performed strongly as the group continues to grow its market share in the key import season in the US. Profits in Fyffes pineapple business rose strongly benefitting from an improvement in market conditions and stability in supply volumes, particularly in H1.

Current trading has been satisfactory in the year to date, although pricing is behind year on year. As a result and given the potential for volatility in the core banana business over the course of the year, management has set a wide initial guidance range for adjusted EBITA of €30-35m (vs. Goodbody forecasts for €33.7m). At first glance, we are unlikely to change our forecasts."

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced that it will hold a bond auction on Thursday, 13 March, the first such auction since 21 September 2010.



Speaking today, John Corrigan, NTMA chief executive said: “The resumption of scheduled bond auctions builds on the phased re-entry to the capital markets achieved by the NTMA over the past two years and marks the full normalisation of Ireland’s presence in the markets.”



The details of the bond auction on 13 March are as follows:



Bond to be auctioned: 3.40% Treasury Bond 2024



Auction size: €1bn



The auction will be conducted on the Bloomberg Auction System and will be confined to recognised primary dealers.

Escher Group FY13 results statement highlights positive pipeline: Rachael of Goodbody comments - - "Escher Group has announced FY13 results this morning. Revenue of $24.7m had already been reported in the group’s trading statement in January while adjusted EBITDA came in at $4.2m (company definition), 5% ahead of the $4m guidance given in January. Adj. EPS came in at 4.8c versus our 5.6c forecast with a higher interest and tax charges the key differences.

License revenue was $5.1m, -19% yoy, and -5% versus our forecast. The statement notes that the yoy performance was impacted by the fact that the group received licence revenue from Malaysia in the prior year but this was somewhat offset by the extension of the number of licences in the Saudi Post contract and ongoing payments received from USPS. In addition, this revenue was held back by the delay of the USPS licence fee in 2013. The group remains confident of recognising this revenue in H114 (c. $6m). Maintenance revenue was $5.4m, +6% yoy, driven by the full year impact of customers signed in 2012. Support revenue was -11% yoy to $2.5m, which reflected a contract renewal done during the year. In terms of services revenue, it was +35% yoy to $11.6m, versus our $10.3m forecast, driven by the group's work with the USPS and the Malaysian post office. Gross profit margin (61% v 66% in 2012) was impacted by the revenue mix which was more weighted towards the lower margin services revenue during the year.

On current trading and outlook, for the Riposte division (postal software) the statement notes that the group has been in contact with several postal organisations and is confident of signing new customers in 2014. Within Escher Interactive Services (digital mail and mobile wallet solutions), it notes that the pipeline of opportunities has expanded significantly over the last 12 months and Escher remains confident about the prospects for 2014.

Overall, we are unlikely to make any significant changes to FY14 forecasts following this morning’s announcement. It is encouraging to see the group note the pipeline of potential deals for both of its divisions. While we have c.3 wins in our forecasts per annum for its postal software division already, further traction in its interactive services division could see upside to group forecasts and our price target.

Banks: SME survey indicates uptick in loan refusal rate; Eamonn Hughes and Colm Foley comment - - "The latest Quarterly Bank Watch Survey at the end of February by ISME, the small and medium sized enterprises association, has shown that refusal rates by banks to lend to small businesses rose by 4 points to 54%. The survey of 924 owner-managers of SMEs also found that 60% of respondents had increased of bank charges imposed on them whilst 18% had incurred increased interest rates.

The uptick in refusals comes against the background of the improving economy and the previous quarterly survey which reported an improving refusal rate from 58% to 50%. Indeed, credit standards in the most recent Central Bank input to the EU Bank Lending Survey highlighted unchanged credit standards for the SME sector in Q413 whilst there was an expectation that standards in Q114 would also be unchanged.

The quick reversal in the refusal rate is surprising and something we’ll need to monitor, but ongoing evidence of an improving economy highlights that, on balance, conditions for the SME sector should be showing some signs of improvement. Evidence of higher charges is also likely to flow through to better income for the banks in due course.

Economic View: GDP data likely to confirm investment-led recovery; Dermot O'Leary of Goodbody comments - - "Positive momentum in the Irish economy is expected to be confirmed by this week’s Q4 2013 GDP data. A key feature of recent quarters, and indeed of our forecasts for the coming years, is that a rebound in investment is leading recovery in domestic demand. This should be a feature of the Q4 2013 data.

For 2013 as a whole, we are forecasting that GDP grew by 0.4%, following a 0.2% expansion in 2012. On first glance, therefore, describing Ireland as a “growth beacon” would be very much an exaggeration. However, the “patent cliff” in the pharmaceutical sector has played a significant role in depressing GDP growth over that period; we estimate 1.0% to 1.5%. More encouraging is the trend in domestic demand. In Q3 2013, domestic demand, excluding the volatile aircraft component, grew by 1.6%, its fastest rate of growth since 2007. Within this, investment grew by 8% yoy, with contributions from both business machinery and equipment and construction. Surveys over recent months suggest that trends in the former continued, while momentum in the construction sector has also been maintained (confirmed by this morning’s PMI). After falling for the first three quarters of the year, we expect consumer spending to make a small contribution to growth in Q4.

Another key aspect of the GDP data that we will be watching closely is the nominal data, as they will act as an input into the deficit and debt to GDP calculations. News on this front has been slightly disappointing of late, owing to very low inflationary pressures. The key theme of the data though should be one of an improving, and indeed better quality, economic recovery.

Irish and European industry continues to recover in 2014: Conall Mac Coille of Davy comments - - "European stock indices fell on Friday: the Euro Stoxx 50 fell 1.6% and the S&P500 rose 0.1%. On-going tensions over Crimea held back risk appetite despite better-than- expected US non-farm payrolls at 175,000. US Treasury yields jumped on the news to above 2.8% from 2.72%. The euro rose to a fresh high against the dollar, breaking through $1.39 in early trade, as investors weighed the ECB’s decision to keep rates on hold.

German industrial production grew by 5.0% in the year to January 2014, well above expectations. French data released this morning show manufacturing up 1.4% on the year. Italian figures will be released at 09.00 this morning. Given the strength of euro area manufacturing PMI surveys (53.2 in February) and the hard data on output, the consensus forecast for just 1.9% euro area industrial production growth in 2014 looks overly pessimistic.

In this context, Friday’s industrial production data for Ireland provided further evidence that the sector is benefitting from the improving cycle in Europe. Irish industrial production fell by 1.1% in the year to January but was split between a 5.3% fall in the modern sector and a 7.8% rise in traditional manufacturing.

Output in the labour-intensive traditional sector (accounting for two-thirds, or 137,100, of total industrial sector employment of 200,000), is gradually recovering, broadly in tandem with the broader European sector. In contrast, the pharmaceutical sector has been hurt by the patent cliff. However, pharmaceutical companies employ just 40,000 and have responded to the patent cliff by increasing investment in plant and R&D to bring the next generation of drugs to market. So, even within the pharmaceutical sector, there has been no evidence of aggregate job cuts.

Separately, new cars licensed in February were up 23% on 2013 levels and new goods vehicles licensed were up by 45%. This provides further evidence that the rebound in Irish consumer and business confidence has led households and companies to increase their spending. Indeed, the surge in Irish consumer confidence through H2 2013 was accompanied by a pick-up in surveys on households’ intentions to spend on big ticket items such as cars."###3142||Oil tanker now in international waters, says GNC member

A man is thrilled after hanging a flat-screen television on his living room wall, waltzing over to the kitchen to grab snacks.

And then, like the tortilla chip in his mouth, the TV shatters into pieces, after falling to the floor.





"Installing your TV while high is now legal," says the ad, but, "driving to get a new one isn't."





According to USA Today , it is one of three advertisements in a "Drive High, Get a DUI" campaign by Colorado to combat stoned driving, since the state started selling recreational marijuana on Jan. 1.













Washington is the only other state where recreational pot is legalized, and it plans to begin selling it this year, USA Today reported.





"As Coloradans now have more access to marijuana, we want them to be aware that law enforcement is trained to identify impairment by all categories of drugs and alcohol," Col. Scott Hernandez, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said in a statement





In another advertisement , a man continues to dribble a basketball on the court as other players look on impatiently. A third ad features a man trying to turn on the grill, not realizing the propane tank is missing.





The ads use humour to remind drivers not to use marijuana and get behind the wheel.





The approach is receiving kudos online, but not everyone is impressed, some saying the ads exaggerate behaviour and ridicule pot smokers.





"Hey CDOT, if you want marijuana consumers to listen to you, I'd suggest talking to them like the rational, normal adults they are instead of insulting them," wrote one YouTube user.





"I understand that in order to make a point you're going to want to exaggerate things a bit but isn't this clearly going too far," another commenter wrote on YouTube.





"Any logical, reasonable person should be able to see how this is a fraudulent, misleading, and flat-out insulting representation of pot smokers, right?"





According to the Colorado Department of Transportation , it is illegal to drive with five nanograms of active THC per millilitre of blood. Those who do can be prosecuted for driving under the influence.





But as USA Today reported, it is difficult to discern how much marijuana that is.

The nutrition and supplement company’s shares plunged more than 12 percent following a brief halt in trading pending the announcement.

Herbalife said that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to elaborate. The FTC’s website says that these are used to investigate possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The company, which has faced accusations of operating a pyramid scheme, said that it welcomes the inquiry given “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business.

Herbalife says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully. The company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Los Angeles, uses a network of distributors to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products globally.

The FTC inquiry comes just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company.

Ackman has bet against the company and said repeatedly that he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme, which is when a company makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products that they sell.

On Tuesday, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management resumed this effort Tuesday, holding a public event to detail his firm’s claims of how its Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme in China, violating laws there.

Herbalife has repeatedly denied the claims and rival investor Carl Icahn has disagreed as well, taking his fight against Ackman public and increasing his stake in the company.

Its shares fell $5.57, or 8.5 percent, to $59.92 in mid-afternoon, but fell as low as $54.59 earlier. Its shares had fallen almost 17 percent so far this year through Tuesday’s close.###3146||Empty###3147||The Incidental Economist found back in 2009 that high-risk pools, which were active in 35 states, only accommodated up to 54 percent of possible individuals within a state, and sometimes only one percent. Premiums were often 25 percent of a person's income. States found that they couldn't afford to subsidize more of the premiums, or expand the program so more people could enroll.

Healthy people would benefit if the sickest patients were no longer in their insurance pool, since rates could be lower. Those less healthy individuals would be competing for spots in the high-risk pools.

Promotion of health savings accounts: Health savings accounts allow you to deposit pre-tax funds into a savings account towards qualifying medical costs if you have a high deductible plan. Obamacare makes the accounts slightly less necessary by capping out-of-pocket costs. It also prohibits the use of HSA funds to buy over the counter drugs (without a prescription) and raises the withdrawal fee from 10 to 20 percent.

When President Bush started promoting the accounts in 2006, Mother Jones described the pros and cons. "Many health care analysts fear that widespread acceptance of HSAs will separate the wealthy and healthy from the sick in insurance pools," they wrote, "and drive up premiums and out-of-pocket health costs for the latter." It's not clear whether that happened, but HSAs grew in popularity between 2007 and 2013 (from five percent to 20 percent of workers) as employers tried to cut down on healthcare costs. The plans definitely benefit wealthy individuals over low income individuals, who can't use the tax benefits or afford high deductibles as easily.

Inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together: The Small Business Health Options Plan — the SHOP exchange — already allows business owners to sign up and select plans for employees to choose from. Enrollment has been slow, but unlike the individual market, the SHOP exchange is open year round. The GOP likely wouldn't offer an exchange, but just encourage businesses to buy insurance together with tax breaks.

Maybe Included

Buying insurance across state lines: As Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic explains, in the past insurance was more expensive in some states because of regulations that required insurers to sell plans regardless of pre-existing conditions. If insurers could sell across state lines, insurers would relocate to states with lower regulation, where they would be allowed to identify customers more freely.

Guaranteed renewability of policies: What's important here is that Republicans are only considering including guaranteed renewability in their plan. The GOP plan might reverse that provision in Obamacare, but it's unlikely.

Changes to medical-malpractice regulations: This is something both Democrats and Republicans support, depending on what the reforms are. "There are versions that simply shield physicians from lawsuits or limit their liability, rather than improving the system so that truly bad providers receive punishment and quality of care improves," writes Cohn. In the past the GOP has supported bills to cap pain and suffering payments at $250,000, but states' rights activists within the party derailed efforts for federal regulation.

If accurate, the number does represent a steep increase over the 4.2 million that were said to have signed up at the beginning of the month. At this rate, administration cheerleaders reason, the goal of 7 million enrolled in the Affordable Care Act may yet be reached at some point in the near future, if not quite on time. This burst of enrollments is seen as a vindication of President Obama’s all-out push to promote the law including such questionable activities as appearing on the “Between Two Ferns” web show where he traded barbs with comedian Zach Galifianakis.

But before the president and his team start popping the champagne corks to celebrate their achievement and their faux hipness, it’s time once again to point out that the administration’s Potemkin enrollment figures should be read with a truckload of salt. As the New York Times reported last month, as much as 20 percent of all those enrolled had not actually paid their premiums, meaning they were not covered by the program. While Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress she had no idea what the numbers of unpaid enrollees were, more states are reporting these figures and, as CNBC reported last week, the results are literally all over the map. While some states report high pay rates, others like Maryland say only 54 percent have paid.

All this calls in to question not only the effectiveness of the sales job done by the president and celebrity supporters such as Lebron James. It also means that the odds that this system can sustain itself without mandating vast increases in rates for those who do pay are getting slimmer every day.

For months we’ve been told by the administration that the only problem with ObamaCare was a “glitchy” website that had since been fixed. But what has since become clear is that the effort to convince young and healthy Americans to sign up for insurance that is both expensive and not something they may need is a failure. Though many of those who clearly benefit from the new health law, such as the poor and those with pre-existing conditions, have signed up, the scheme requires large numbers of those who won’t need the coverage as often in order to be economically viable. That problem will be exacerbated by the failure of much larger percentages of customers to pay for their insurance.

As we’ve noted previously, the non-payment of the premium is not a technicality. Many of those purchasing the insurance may be first-time buyers and not understand that they must pay their bill before coverage starts rather than long after the fact, as they can with a credit card transaction. Or it may be that some enrolled with no intention of paying or thinking that the hype about the glories of ObamaCare they’ve heard in the mainstream media and from the president absolved them of the obligation to pay for it. But either way, the large number of non-payments renders the enrollment figures meaningless and ensures that the rates for those who do pay are going up next year by percentages that will shock them.

The president claimed that the number of enrollees has already reached the point where the law will work rather than collapse from lack of participation. But even if we accept his premise that falling millions of customers short of the announced goal of seven million is no big deal, the fact that hundreds of thousands of those being counted in the pool of those he’s counting are not covered because of non-payment of premiums makes his assertion a colossal fraud.

The president may think that a March madness ad blitz during the NCAA basketball tournament may save ObamaCare. But if the past pattern holds, any further surge in enrollment will provide the scheme with a false sense of security. Until we get a full accounting not only of those who signed up on a website but completed the process by paying for the plan they chose, we’ll have no idea how many people truly are enrolled. Seen in that light, the president’s enrollment promises may well turn out to be no different from other pledges he has made about the ACA in the last few years: completely untrue.###3149||King, the company behind the wildly popular Candy Crush Saga and other popular social games, has provided a look into exactly how much it thinks it can raise in its impending IPO.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday released an amended filing from King showing that the games maker plans to offer 22.2 million shares at its IPO and price them between $21 and $24. Another 3.3 million shares will be offered for over-allotments, should demand for the company's stock surge.

If King can offer all 25.5 million shares at a maximum offering price of $24, the company expects to raise $613 million. Based on all those figures, King is valued at $7.6 billion.

King, which plans to offer its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "KING," announced plans to file an IPO last month. The company did not, however, provide any details at that time on how many shares it would offer and at what price.

The figures from King shared Wednesday are not set in stone. Depending on the response to its shares, King could change its IPO price at the last minute or could decide to stick within its range. The information that the SEC released today is essentially an outline that's subject to change.

King did not say when it plans to file its IPO, but now that it's sharing figures, it appears to be marching toward that point quite swiftly.###3150||The March 31 deadline to sign up for a healthcare plan will be here soon.###3151||All ArticlesMORE BY THIS AUTHOR

###3152||- Sbarro said Monday that it is filing for bankruptcy reorganization, the struggling pizza chain's second trip through bankruptcy court in less than three years.

The filing comes after the company last month announced it would be close 155 of its 400 North American stores, most of which are located in malls and airports.

The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales. It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to "allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy" as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.

Sbarro, sagging under $140 million in debt, had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures.

Other restaurant chains have been hurt by declining mall traffic in recent recent years. Hot Dog on a Stick, an employee-owned chain with locations mostly in the West and Midwest, cited expensive mall leases in declaring bankruptcy last month.###3153||Investing.com -

Investing.com - China widened the range in which the yuan can fluctuate against the U.S. dollar at the weekend, signalling it could accept more volatility for the exchange rate and challenge the perception that the currency is a one-way bet.



The People's Bank of China said Saturday the yuan will be allowed to move 2% either side of the central parity against the dollar starting from Monday, doubling the previous 1% range.



China has pledged to make the yuan more flexible since 2005 when the currency was originally unshackled from its dollar peg and the country has a longer-term aim for a fully convertible yuan that was enshrined by the Communist Party at a meeting last November.



The government is committed to gradually dismantling China's capital account regime, but foreign exchange reserves are expected to rise sharply again this year, from $3.8 trillion to well over $4 trillion.



The weekend move was the third since July 2005 and follows a widening from 0.5% in April 2012.

Application may not work as expected.###3155||An investigation into the pilots of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 intensified Monday as officials confirmed that the last words spoken from the cockpit came after a key signalling system was manually disabled.

US intelligence efforts also were focusing on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, according to a senior US lawmaker.

“I think from all the information I’ve been briefed on from, you know, high levels within homeland security, national counterterrorism centre, intelligence community, that something was going on with the pilot,” said Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.

“I think this all leads towards the cockpit, with the pilot himself, and co-pilot,” McCaul said on Fox News Sunday.

Malaysia’s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed that an apparently relaxed final voice communication from the cockpit — “All right, good night” — came after the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) had been deliberately shut down.

ACARS transmits to the ground key information on a plane’s condition.

It has not been confirmed who gave that final voice message. But the assumption is the person would have known the ACARS system had been disabled.

The plane’s transponder — which relays radar information on the plane’s location — was switched off 14 minutes after ACARS went down.

Shortly afterwards the plane disappeared from civilian radar. It continued to show up as a blip on military radar, but was not immediately identified as the same flight.

The plane went missing early in the morning of March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard, spawning a massive international search across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean that has turned up no trace of wreckage.

– ‘Contradictory information’ –

Two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese, and state media in China attacked Malaysia anew on Monday for its handling of the crisis.

“The contradictory and piecemeal information Malaysia Airlines and its government have provided has made search efforts difficult and the entire incident even more mysterious,” the state-controlled China Daily newspaper wrote in an editorial.

For relatives of those on board, a hijacking scenario provides a slim hope that the plane might have landed undetected somewhere.

“If they found the wreckage of the plane then that would be finalised because there’s no hope,” said Australian David Lawton, whose brother was on the plane.

“But while you’ve got hope, you’ve got worries too. Because if they’re alive, are they being treated well, or what’s happening?” he told Fairfax media.

The number of countries involved in the physical search for the jet has nearly doubled over the past two days to 26, after satellite and military radar data projected two dauntingly large corridors the plane might have flown through.

The northern corridor stretches in an arc over south and central Asia, while the other swoops deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.

Malaysia announced that it was deploying its naval and air force assets to the southern corridor, with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott vowing substantial assistance.

Three officials from France’s civil aviation accident investigation agency arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to share their experiences of the search for Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

The “black boxes” from that crash were eventually recovered nearly two years later from a depth of more than 3,800 meters (12,500 feet).

– Political dimension? –

The Malaysian authorities have stressed that the backgrounds of all the passengers and crew are being checked — as well as engineers who may have worked on the plane before take-off.

Senior US intelligence officials cited by the New York Times said they had run the names of everyone on board through their data banks without any tangible result.

That included a check on a passenger identified as an artist belonging to China’s Muslim Uighur minority. Uighur separatists have become increasingly militant in their fight against Chinese rule.

Malaysian police have searched both pilots’ residences and are examining a flight simulator that Captain Zaharie, 53, had installed at his home.

Associates say Zaharie was an active supporter of Malaysia’s political opposition headed by veteran politician Anwar Ibrahim.

In a highly controversial case, Anwar was convicted of sodomy — illegal in Muslim Malaysia — just hours before MH370 took off.

But friends say Zaharie exhibited no extreme views.

Fariq, meanwhile, was accused in an Australian television report of allowing two young South African women into the cockpit of a plane he piloted in 2011, breaching security rules imposed after the 9/11 attacks in the United States.

But acquaintances have attested to his good character, and reports said he planned to wed his flight-school sweetheart.

Hishammuddin noted that the two pilots “did not ask to fly together” on flight 370.###3156||Energy Secretary Ed Davey has ruled out energy companies hiking their prices due to the conflict in Ukraine as gas is typically bought 18 months in advance, and they should therefore be protected from short-term price fluctuations.

As it stands roughly 30% of gas in Europe is supplied by Russia and analysts have warned that prices may increase dramatically if sanctions are imposed on Russia.

Experts have, however, added that moderate winter temperatures mean many of Europe’s energy companies are in possession of larger than usual gas reserves.

Escalating conflict could lead to higher prices

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Davey said: “The companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance. So they shouldn’t be using it as an excuse to put up people’s prices.

“But we have seen when this crisis broke there was a spike in oil and gas prices. They’ve now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices.”

Britain should seek to be less dependent on energy exports

The energy secretary added that the Ukrainian crisis illustrated the need for Britain to develop its own sources of energy.

In this context, he commented on the need for additional energy to be produced via wind and nuclear power stations, as well as shale gas extraction.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Hertz (HTZ) said Tuesday it will spin off its equipment rental business, Hertz Equipment Rental, in an effort to refocus on the company's car rental business. The spinoff of Hertz' equipment rental business is expected to generate $2.5 billion in cash that will be used to pay down the company's debt and support a newly approved $1 billion share repurchase.

Overall, the spinoff may dramatically alter Hertz' capital structure, putting its leverage in line with competitors, while providing Wall Street with a far more straightforward car rental business. The move also comes as Hertz provided investors with a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2014.

Tuesday's decision to spin the equipment rental business may help Hertz weather a rough patch in the car rental market, while also insulating the company and its management from activist investors.

Hertz's newly announced share repurchase could allow the car rental chain to buy back 20% of its outstanding shares, the company said in a Tuesday statement. Hertz also raised the prospect of additional returns of capital to shareholders as a result of the company's targeted net debt ratio of 2.5-to-3.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Those targets indicate Hertz could see its leverage rise from year-end net-debt of 2.9 times EBITDA, putting the company closer in line with Avis Budget (CAR). Analysts had forecast Hertz net debt-to-EBITDA could fall in the coming year without a change to its capital planning.

"The actions announced today will create separate companies which we expect to benefit from improved financial profiles that include increased earnings stability and higher returns on capital," Mark P. Frissora, CEO of Hertz said in a statement.

Equipment Rental

Hertz Equipment Rental may be renamed and will have its own management team after the spinoff. The business generated annual revenues of over $1.5 billion in 2013, with 38% of those sales from construction market, 26% from industrial users, and a further 36% from other markets including niche markets like the energy sector.

At separation, the business is expected to have net debt of 3.5 times-to-4.0 times 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Hertz will retain its Donlen fleet leasing business.

Hertz and Dollar Thrifty

For Hertz's more well-known car rental business, the spinoff may improve the company's cash flow, allowing the company to return capital to shareholders.

The spinoff may also give investors access to a pure-play car rental business that may be in recovery after the market was dramatically oversupplied in the years since the financial crisis. Consolidation such as Hertz takeover of Dollar Thrifty, and a recovering economy may also allow rental giants like Hertz, Avis Budget (CAR) and Enterprise to regain their pricing power.

Activist Investors

In December, Third Point Management and Corvex Management were reported as having taken stakes in Hertz, in an effort to unlock value at the car rental giant. Those reported investments came after company's weak third-quarter results, which caused shares to significantly underperform the S&P 500 in the second half of 2013.

Hertz enacted a so-called 'poison pill' in response to high trading volumes in the company's shares and around the time media reports of activist investors surfaced. Third Point repeatedly declined to comment on those reports, and on Tuesday declined to provide any statement.

In a late December note to clients reacting to those media reports, JPMorgan analyst Kevin Milota said Hertz investors were frustrated the company hadn't moved quicker with a sale or spinoff of its capital intensive equipment rental business. Such a transaction could unlock significant free cash flow for Hertz and increase the company's strategic focus on the rental car market, Milota said.

"In our view, if HTZ was to exit the equipment rental business, its free cash flow profile would dramatically increase," the analyst wrote. JPMorgan estimated Hertz would generate $693 million in 2014 free cash flow and $936 million in 2015.

On Tuesday, Milota said in a client note "we believe investors will receive the HERC spin announcement with open arms, offsetting what was otherwise a soft [quarter[ from an operating and full-year 2014 guidance perspective."

Weak Guidance

Hertz on Tuesday said it expected full-year 2014 revenue to be between $11.4-to-$11.7 billion, and EBITDA to be between $2.06 billion-to-$2.42 billion, generally a guidance that was below Wall Street consensus. Earnings per share guidance came in at between $1.70-to-$2.00 a share.

The lukewarm guidance provided by Hertz management underscores the strategic imperative of streamlining its operations and rejiggering the company's capital structure. Those initiatives could help Hertz navigate through supply issues in the car rental industry, for which it is the major culprit.

Hertz cited over-fleeting for an especially weak first quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance and said that the issue could be resolved by the end of the quarter, after dragging on earnings through the second half of 2013.

Management Focus

Hertz continues to integrate its acquisition of Dollar Thrifty and will use the equipment rental spin off to quickly pay down debt assumed in the deal. The acquisition culminated a multi-year effort by Hertz to buy its down-market competitor. It may also come to the forefront of Hertz strategy given the company's efforts to streamline business lines and re-configure its capital structure towards expanded returns of capital to investors.

Whether Hertz initiates a dividend is still to be seen. Hertz shares fell less than 1% in Tuesday trading, closing at $27.08. Shares have gained over 27% over the past 12-months.

-- Written by Antoine Gara in New York###3159||Maker of the hit game Candy Crush Saga, King, has reportedly filed for an IPO in the US to raise an estimated 532.8 million dollars.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

It has been believed that the main reason to go public could be to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer.

The report added that the company, behind other popular free-to-play games like Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga and Bubble Witch Saga, would trade as KING on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when it goes public.###3160||Vodafone has bought Spain's Ono telecom firm for €7.2bn. The deal will see the company significantly expand its presence throughout mainland Europe

Months after UK telecom multinational Vodafone announced it was retreating from its US operations, the company has made an effort to refocus its expansion plans on Europe. This morning a deal to buy Spain’s Ono telecom firm added to a number of strategic acquisitions across Europe in recent months.

The deal, worth €7.2bn, comes almost eight months after Vodafone announced it was selling its stake in US giant Verizon Wireless for a colossal $130bn, and six months after Vodafone bought Germany’s largest cable firm Kabel Deutschland for €7.7bn.

The company is looking to press ahead with expansion throughout mainland Europe as it tries to wrestle back control of the telecom market from a number of competitors that have sprung up in recent years.

CEO Vittorio Colao has told reporters that the Ono deal represented an “attractive value creation opportunity” for his firm. “Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the past few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.”

mainland Europe

While Vodafone has cut its ties with Verizon, another US telecoms giant has been rumoured to be looking at buying a stake for many months. AT&T was reportedly set to take a position in Vodafone as a result of its Verizon sale, but in mid-March the firm’s CEO, Randall Stephenson, played down the prospects of such a bid.

He told an investor conference that time is running out for his firm investing in European wireless operators, after UK regulators forced it to rule out making a bid for six months earlier this year. He pointed to the number of operators boosting their LTE operations in recent years, meaning there was little value to be found for US investors. “Europe way underinvested for quite some period of time in terms of LTE. What we had always believed was going to transpire is now transpiring.”

“The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it,” said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

“The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,” he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape when contacted by AFP.

Libyan authorities had said late Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for ex-rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading Al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil but the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, is the first to actually do so.

The standoff at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.###3166||Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 denial-of-service attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of requests for pages and data to the target, crippling its computer system.###3167||At Obamacare enrollment events around the state, recruitment organizers emphasize the positive reasons for buying coverage on the insurance marketplace, like staying healthy and getting financial assistance to help pay their monthly premiums.

But there’s also the punitive side of the law: how much those who don’t enroll will have to pay at tax time next year.

The deadline to enroll is coming fast — March 31 — and many people don’t realize they could be paying far more than the $95 flat fee talked about in the early days of the law, according to enrollment counselors, income tax preparation agents and accountants.

Depending on the size of their households and income levels, not enrolling for Obamacare can run into hundreds of dollars, and for a few higher-income earners, possibly thousands.

Brian Haile, senior vice president of health policy for the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service based in Parsippany, said most people in the early days of the program recall talk about a $95 flat fee due next year for not complying with the law. But Haile said there was a second part to that equation: The fee is either $95 for adults and $47.50 per child or 1 percent of their gross adjusted income, whichever is greater.

“It’s been a good news and bad news session with any number of clients,” Haile said. “A lot of people coming in assume they have to pay this year, and when I tell them you do not have to pay until next year, there is a sense a relief. But then I explain it’s more than $95, and the anxiety goes right up. We explain to them $95 is the least you will have to pay, and you are very likely to pay considerably more.”

For example, a couple earning $68,000 where only one has health insurance would owe 1 percent of their income if that person doesn’t sign up. After subtracting the first $20,300 of their income not taxed by the IRS for couples who file jointly, the couple would end up paying $477 next year, Haile said.

Jim Logan of Mount Ephraim, a certified application counselor hired by the New Jersey Hospital Association to assist the enrollment drive in the state, has encountered similar confusion.

“In my experience, they are equating the penalty with $95. When told the full extent, most people are aghast,” Morgan said. “As far as what they plan to do, most decide to get the insurance.”

People who decline to buy coverage would have the penalties deducted from their tax refund, which Haile called “quite an enforcement tool” considering three out of four families qualify for a refund at an average of $3,000. It’s not clear what would happen to those who don’t get a tax refund.

Joel Cantor, director for Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, said it’s easier to show the benefits of enrolling for people with modest incomes who are eligible for subsidies to help pay for coverage.

He said those with higher incomes would be hit harder, noting a family of four making $95,000 would get a meager subsidy. For families above that threshold, the penalty “could be $10,000 or $11,000 a year, and you can buy a plan for that.”

There is a limit to the fee. It can’t be more than the average price of the least expensive “bronze” level health plan available through the marketplace, according to the law. But that could run up to $3,600 per adult plus $1,900 per child, according to the Tax Policy Center, founded by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.

There are many exceptions to the rules. There’s no penalty for people who don’t file income taxes because they earn too little. Married people who file jointly and earn below $20,300 and single people who earn less than $10,050 also won’t be penalized, according to the IRS.

Sometimes people are “pleasantly surprised” when they study the details of the law and “learn they qualify for Medicaid or their children may qualify for the children’s health insurance program,” Haile said.

Medicaid is available for a family of four making $31,322 or less or a childless adult earning no more than $15,282. The March 31 enrollment cut-off for private insurance does not apply for Medicaid and people may sign up year-round. The federally run health exchange in New Jersey has signed up 74,000 in private insurance and 123,000 for Medicaid.

Supporters of the health care law say many people don’t know about Obamacare details because the state hasn’t done enough to inform the public. The Christie administration missed a deadline last month to use a $7.6 million federal grant to promote the health exchange, and the state has not spent money specifically to promote the health exchanges.

Justine Ceserano, director for the New Jersey chapter of Get Covered America, which is heading the outreach effort to enroll people, said much of their focus is on the benefits of getting covered.

“While we certainly provide accurate information about the fine to anyone who inquires about it, we focus more on the financial help that is available through the marketplace, which many uninsured New Jerseyans still don’t know about,” Ceserano said. “Our research shows that people are more likely to respond to information about financial help and the fact that they can avoid paying a fine if they sign up by March 31 than to the specifics of the penalty.”

Louis Feuerstein, a partner in the accounting firm ParenteBeard in Philadelphia, agreed people don’t fully grasp the nuances involving the fines, but he believes it’s a secondary concern. “They want health care,” Feuerstein said. “They want to be covered.”

Note: A sentence was clarified in this story and changed to this: He said those with higher incomes would be hit harder, noting a family of four making $95,000 would get a meager subsidy. For families above that threshold, the penalty “could be $10,000 or $11,000 a year, and you can buy a plan for that.”



The Kaiser Family Foundation and Jackson Hewitt offer more information about premium costs and penalties.

More Politics###3168||(Newser) – General Motors is facing more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened inquiries into the matter. The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars, including the Cobalt, from model years 2003 to 2007, says a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the US Attorney's Office in New York and is in its early stages, reports Reuters.

At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner. If no criminal charges result, federal prosecutors could pursue civil charges, notes the New York Times.###3169||We use cookies to give you the best experience on our site.

Hackers have taken over some of the web accounts of Mark Karpeles - boss of the troubled MtGox Bitcoin exchange.

The attack on Mr Karpeles seems to have been motivated by growing frustration over the actions of MtGox.

Last month MtGox stopped trading and filed for bankruptcy after finding out that $465m (£279m) in bitcoins had been lost via a security bug.

Many have called on the exchange to release more information about what happened to the lost bitcoins.

The attacks were mounted on the personal blog and Reddit account of Mr Karpeles and left the hackers in charge of both social media accounts.

The attackers used their access to grab detailed information about trading activity at MtGox. They then shared their findings by posting a 716MB file containing much of what they had found.

The material posted included an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million trades, entries from MtGox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.

"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word "Goxed" has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading MtGox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.

It was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg.

He pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network.###3172||Empty###3173||Empty###3174||Good morning. Here's what you need to know.

Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. "Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan(CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014," say economists at Standard Chartered.

Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.

Copper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.

Quiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.

Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.

Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion. "Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments," says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take — the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.

Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of 2013. "International banking activity was characterised by lower credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013, mirroring developments in the previous quarter," said the BIS in its Quarterly Review published Sunday. "Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466 billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or 4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres ($35 billion or 1.7%)."

Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. "Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow," write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. "For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine)."

ECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. "It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development," Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. "When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment." The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.###3175||This Page Is Under Construction - Coming Soon!

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline's chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane's automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane - an informal "all right, good night" - was spoken after the tracking system, known as "ACARS", was shut down.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape," Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane's status - had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia's northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

"We don't know when the ACARS was switched off after that," Ahmad Jauhari said. "It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through."

FOCUS ON CREW

The plane vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off its communications systems as the plane flew across the Gulf of Thailand.

Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry,

Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: "We are looking at it." But it was only one of the possibilities under investigation, he added.

Intensive efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the airplane had not, as of Monday, turned up any information linking anyone to militant groups or anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the aircraft, U.S. and European security sources said.

One source familiar with U.S. inquiries into the disappearance said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the ACARS system.

Many experts and officials say while the jet's transponder can be switched off by flicking a switch in the cockpit, turning off ACARS may have required someone to open a trap door outside the cockpit, climb down into the plane's belly and pull a fuse or circuit breaker.

Whoever did so, had to have sophisticated knowledge of the systems on a 777, according to pilots and two current and former U.S. officials close to the investigation.

Malaysian police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practice flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.###3177||Asian CEOs are mostly declining to take a stand on whether they will speak at an investment conference that has become contentious after the suspected death of Saudi journalist, a contrast with U.S. and European counterparts.###3178||The mainland’s policies on Hong Kong remain steadfast, Premier Li Keqiang said as he vowed Beijing would “do everything” to help maintain the territory’s economic status.

He pledged the government’s support to the city – a sometimes recalcitrant ally – in maintaining its status as an international financial hub and shipping centre.

“[We will] do everything that benefits Hong Kong's prosperity. That’s what we did in the past, and [that holds true] now,” he said in Beijing on Wednesday, after the concluding ceremony of the National People’s Congress meetings.

“China’s policies to Hong Kong and Macau remain consistent and clear,” Li said.

The premier said Hong Kong played a key role in the country’s “opening up” economic policy, which began in the 1970s.

“Hong Kong has made significant contributions during reforms and the opening up of China,” he said. “Under the process of deepening reforms, Hong Kong will have more development opportunities.”

The premier also cited the city’s ability to weather the global economy’s ups and downs in recent years. “That means Hong Kong has a competitive economy,” Li said.

With the Hong Kong people’s fighting spirit, the city will maintain its edge amid increasing competition in the global market, he said.

Hong Kong, ceded by Britain to China in 1997, works under the “one party, two systems” policy which affords it autonomy in economic, legal and foreign affairs.

In recent months, Hong Kong and Beijing have grappled with the issue of implementing universal suffrage in the territory in three years. Hong Kong has also sought to douse anti-mainlander sentiments from small protest groups.

After months of tense speculation on whether Beijing would weigh in on the issue, the National People's Congress upheld the move towards suffrage as "according to law" and urged a "smooth implementation" of plans for direct elections.

However, Hong Kong lawmakers have been bogged down by bickering over the nomination process for the next chief executive -- whether to let the public or a special committee nominate the candidates.###3179||The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Wednesday, with sentiment suggesting an extension of the downtrend, as the grapple with uncertainties. The lack of any directional cues has intensified the uncertainty concerning the domestic economic outlook, while concerns about the global have also increased in the wake of recent data from China. Global cues are negative, with European stocks declining sharply in the session. Against the backdrop, the markets may witness more selling, although a large scale correction is unlikely.

U.S. stocks declined moderately on Tuesday amid a lack of any major directional cues. The major averages opened higher but moved lower immediately after. After staging a short-lived recovery in late morning trading, the indexes declined steadily throughout the remainder of the session before closing lower.

The Dow Industrials ended down 67.43 points or 0.41 percent at 16,351 and the S&P 500 Index closed 9.54 points or 0.51 percent lower at 1,868 and the Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 4,307, down 27.26 points or 0.63 percent.

Twenty-one of the thirty Dow components declined, with DuPont (DD), JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), United Technologies (UTX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) leading the declines.

Biotechnology, energy, basic material, computer hardware and financial stocks were among the worst performers of the session.

Commodity, Currency Markets

Crude oil futures are receding $1.62 to $98.41 a barrel after sliding $1.09 to $100.03 a barrel on Tuesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,363.90, up $17.20 from the previous session's close of $1,346.70. On Tuesday, gold added $5.20.

Among currencies, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.70 yen compared to the 103.02 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.3894 compared to yesterday's $1.3860.



Asia

The major Asian markets retreated, with the negative lead from Wall Street weighing on the averages in the region. The risk aversion in play in the markets exerted upward pressure on the yen, sending Japanese stocks lower.

Japan's Nikkei 225 average opened lower and moved roughly sideways before ending down 393.72 points or 2.59 percent at 14,830. The market witnessed broad based weakness, with Nisshin Steel, Dainippon Sumitomo, Furukawa, Tokyo Dome and Nissan Chemical Industries leading the declines.

Australia's All Ordinaries also languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing 28.80 points or 0.53 percent lower at 5,401. Most sectors moved to the downside, although material and healthcare stocks saw some strength.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 21,902, down 367.66 points or 1.65 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index ended 3.47 points or 0.17 percent lower at 1,998.

On the economic front, the results of a survey conducted by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute showed that their seasonally adjusted consumer confidence index for Australia dropped 0.7 percent sequentially to a ten-month low of 99.5 in March. A separate report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the number of home loans in Australia stayed broadly unchanged in January after recording a marked fall at the end of last year.

The Cabinet Office reported that its consumer confidence index for Japan fell 2.2 points to 38.2 in February. A report released by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed that its index of activity in the tertiary sector rose a better than expected 0.9 percent in January. Meanwhile, corporate goods prices in Japan eased modestly in February, according to a report released by the Bank of Japan. The index eased 0.2 percent month-over-month compared to expectations for a 0.2 percent increase.

Europe

European stocks opened lower and are currently trading notably lower.

In corporate news, Deutsche Post reported an increase in its fourth quarter profit despite a small drop in sales. German utilitu EON reported a drop in profits for 2013, although the decline was in line with expectations. The company also forecasts a decline in its profits for 2014. U.K. insurer Prudential reported an increase in its operating profit for 2013 and also raised its dividend.

On the economic front, Employment in France's non-agricultural sector returned to growth in the December quarter, ending six quarters of contraction, according to data released by statistical office Insee. The number of employees in the market sector, excluding the farm division, rose by 15,100, or 0.1 percent, in the fourth quarter from the preceding three-month period, when payroll numbers decreased by about 9,600.

It should be noted, that the current mortgage interest rates may vary without prior notice from the lender and are subject to change based on location, geography and other terms and conditions. The annual percentage rates (APR) were made based on discount points, origination fees, average loan fees and closing costs.

As far as U.S. mortgage applications are concerned, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) announced the results of its latest weekly mortgage survey last week. According to the MBA’s data, mortgage application activity in the U.S. improved 9.4% in the week ended February 28. More Americans decided to file applications for mortgage refinancing, as the Refinance Index rose 10% in the said period. With regards to home purchase applications, the Purchase Index edged up 9%. The refinance share of total mortgage applications decreased to 57.7%, the MBA reported.

In other news, national average mortgage rates fell last week, according to Virgina-based mortgage finance company, Freddie Mac. The 30-year fixed mortgage averaged a rate of 4.28% last week, down by 9 basis points compared to the previous 4.37% that it held in the prior week. The 15-year FRM averaged 3.32% last week, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.

According to Consumer Reports, approximately 70 percent of retirees’ net wealth is locked up in their homes. Given that statistic, you’d think that reverse mortgages would be a very popular solution for tapping into all that wealth. Yet prior to 2012, the cost, complexity and even stigma of a reverse mortgage have made it the choice of last resort for elderly retirees needing cash.

Things changed beginning in 2012, when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures most reverse mortgages through its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, created the HECM Saver to lower costs and increase flexibility. Reverse mortgages are now being used not just as a last resort, but as one component of a comprehensive retirement plan.

Benefits

The key benefit of a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners ages 62 and older, is the ability to tap into a portion of your home’s equity value without having to sell your home. You can withdraw a lump sum of money or create a line of credit similar to a home equity line (HELOC), from which you can draw cash when needed.

The amount you can borrow depends on your age (the older you are, the greater the amount), current interest rates and the value of your home.

FROM REVERSEMORTGAGEKDC.COM Nothing needs to be paid back to the lender as long as you or your spouse are alive and living in the home. After you pass away, your estate pays back the principal plus accrued interest to the lender, typically by selling the property. Any remaining equity goes to your heirs. The best part: If there’s not enough equity in the property to cover the loan, the FHA pays the difference to the lender, preserving the remaining assets in the estate for your heirs.

The line of credit option has become the most popular choice, because it offers the most flexibility and incurs the lowest costs. As with a HELOC, if you don’t borrow the money, you don’t pay any interest. Unlike a HELOC, a HECM line of credit cannot be reduced or frozen, and the loan does not become due until your death. The HECM line of credit even grows as you become older, regardless of your home’s value.

Reverse mortgages, however, don’t come for free. There are closing costs and loan origination and servicing fees similar to what you’d incur with a traditional mortgage, not to mention FHA insurance premiums to cover any lender losses from equity declines.

And, of course, there is the interest that you have to pay on the loan, which in the case of a line of credit is variable based on prevailing rates.

All these factors make reverse mortgages more expensive than traditional mortgages. None of these costs has to be paid out-of-pocket. Nonetheless, they do limit the amount you can borrow and also affect the amount of equity your heirs have to sacrifice when your house is eventually sold.

Some additional benefits of a HECM reverse mortgage:

• It’s much easier to qualify for than a traditional mortgage.

• Mandatory independent counseling by a government-trained nonprofit agency before you can apply provides a measure of consumer education and protection.

• Your executor/trustee has up to one year to pay off the loan after repayment becomes due.

The drawbacks

There are downsides to a reverse mortgage as well.

• The loan can be called early due to nonpayment of property taxes, homeowners insurance or failure to adequately maintain the property, potentially forcing you to sell the house prematurely.

• Having extra money available (especially when taken as a lump sum) puts you at risk of spending it too quickly or becoming a target for financial abuse by family or financial advisers. That’s why a reverse mortgage should never be used except as part of a well-thought-through retirement plan.

Alternatives

There are alternatives to a reverse mortgage if you want to access some of the equity built up in your home. The simplest is to downsize by selling your current home and either buying or renting a less expensive, smaller house. Alternatively, if your adult children have the financial wherewithal, you can create a sale-leaseback arrangement in which you sell the house to one (or more) of your children and then rent it back using the cash you get from the sale. Your children benefit by getting rental income and tax write-offs (as long as you structure the transaction properly, according to the IRS), and you get the cash. However, once the lease expires, your children have the right to kick you out. You may not be comfortable giving up that degree of control over your home.

A private reverse mortgage is another option. You’ll benefit because your children will charge you less than commercial lenders, your up-front costs will be lower and there won’t be ongoing mortgage-insurance expenses. Plus the interest rate – which the IRS sets each month – will be lower than what commercial lenders charge. But again, it’s important to structure the deal so that it passes muster with the IRS.

Reverse mortgages have emerged as a viable retirement planning tool as long as they are used carefully and thoughtfully. The more tools we have, the better the likelihood that we can afford to do all the things in our later years that we’d always hoped to do.

“We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,” Plosser told a panel in Paris. “Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts.”

Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.

As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.

But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.

“If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,” Plosser said.

He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy.

“Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,” he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

The Obama administration is requiring health plans in Obamacare insurance marketplaces to include a more robust offering of care providers in 2015 after some early backlash over limited networks in the health care law's first year.

Health plans selling on the federal marketplaces in 2015 must include 30 percent of area "essential community providers," which are usually health centers and other hospitals serving mostly low-income patients. That's up from a 20 percent requirement in 2014, the first year of expanded overage under the health care law.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, will also take a much more active role in reviewing health plan networks. CMS, which outlined the new standards in a Friday night letter to insurers, will evaluate whether the plans include enough access to hospitals, primary care doctors, mental health providers and oncologists.

The updated standards came after a Friday interview in which President Barack Obama acknowledged that pressure to keep down costs could mean consumers may not have access to their choice of doctor.

“You may find out that network is more expensive than another network, then you have to make choices in terms of what’s right for your family,” Obama told WebMD. “Do you want to save on costs, or do you want to save on convenience?”

A senior administration official defended the health law’s standards in a Friday afternoon statement.

“What is what true before the health law is true today insurers have always made decisions about which providers and doctors are in their networks – that won’t change,” the official said. “What is different now is the Affordable Care Act marks the first time that federal law requires insurance plans to offer adequate networks of doctors, including mental health practitioners, pharmacies, hospitals, and community providers. Americans can now choose between different types of plans with different networks to find a plan that best meets their needs.”

CMS late Friday night also released a slew of new standards related to the insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges. For instance, the agency issued new rules related to in-person Obamacare assisters, known as navigators. It also builds on small business insurance marketplaces, which have face several delays in the law's rollout.

CMS also said it will excuse insurers' administrative spending for costs stemming from the failed roll out of Healthcare.gov. The health law requires insurers to provide rebates to customers if they spend more than 20 percent of premium dollars on administrative costs, but CMS says it won't count administrative costs related to the enrollment website's turbulent launch.###3190||The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

The announcement, in a government blog posted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, did not say how many new enrollees are the younger adults that President Barack Obama needs to make his new health insurance marketplaces a success.

But Tavenner said the pace of enrollment has been at its highest since late December, when there was a rush of interest from people who wanted coverage beginning Jan. 1.

She said the federal website HealthCare.gov had 1 million online visitors over the weekend and more than 4 million visitors last week. A federal call center set up to take applications over the telephone had more than 198,000 calls last Thursday.###3191||After moving lower over the course of the two previous sessions, stocks may see some further downside in early trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the , with the Dow futures down by 51 points.

Considerable weakness in the overseas markets is likely to weigh on the markets, with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "With today's declines, most major European markets are at or below the closing lows of March 3rd, the Monday when markets finally reacted lower to Putin's war games."

"In Asia, the Shanghai, Hang Seng, Kospi, ASX, Singapore Straits and Japanese Topix are also at or near the March 3rd close but also are being influenced by China's growth concerns," he added.

While concerns about China and Ukraine are also likely to weigh on U.S. stocks, trading activity may be somewhat subdued amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.

Traders may continue to look ahead to the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices over the next two days.

Among individual stocks, shares of Express (EXPR) are seeing significant weakness in pre-market trading after the apparel retailer reported weaker than expected fourth quarter results and provided disappointing first quarter guidance.

Russian mobile phone operator VimpelCom (VIP) may also come under pressure amid news the company is being investigated by U.S. and Dutch authorities in connection with its in Uzbekistan.

On the other hand, shares of VeriFone (PAY) are likely to see early strength after the maker of card-payment systems reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance.

After initially showing a lack of direction, stocks moved mostly lower over the course of the trading day on Tuesday. The major averages added to the slim losses posted on Monday, with the S&P 500 pulling back further off last Friday's record highs.

The major averages climbed off their worst levels going into the close but remained firmly in the red. The Dow fell 67.43 points or 0.4 percent to 16,351.25, the Nasdaq slid 27.26 points or 0.6 percent to 4,307.19 and the S&P 500 dropped 9.54 points or 0.5 percent to 1,867.63.

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw significant weakness during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index plunged by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.7 percent.

The major European markets have also come under pressure on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has fallen by 1.2 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are down by 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.

In commodities trading, crude oil futures are falling $1.49 to $98.54 a barrel after sliding $1.09 to $100.03 a barrel on Tuesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,366.70, up $20 from the previous session's close of $1,346.70. On Tuesday, gold added $5.20.

Among currencies, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.65 yen compared to the 103.02 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.3897 compared to yesterday's $1.3860.

A new study by Bankrate.com shows that about one third of uninsured Americans are going to remain without coverage and opt to pay the penalty.

The survey results suggest that the administration’s outreach to uninsured people may be falling short, with more than half of people without insurance unaware of the March 31 deadline—and even more unaware of subsidies that could make their policies more affordable.

Related: Obamacare May Be Failing the Uninsured

Bankrate surveyed 3,005 people and found that 41 percent of those who were uninsured said they plan to stay uninsured because they think that health insurance is too costly. Meanwhile, about 70 percent said they were unaware of subsidies available under the new law that could make their health plans more affordable.

The study’s findings are worrisome for the Obama administration since the key goal of the president’s health care law was to extend access to health coverage for the uninsured.

A separate study by the McKinsey consulting firm found just 27 percent of Obamacare enrollees were uninsured. That means that the majority of those signing up for Obamacare had previous insurance of some kind—whether they were kicked off their old policies, or they found a better deal on the exchanges. Though not confirmed by the White House, if accurate, that could mean the law is failing to meet its intended goal.

Related: Gallup: Employment, Obamacare Lower Uninsured Rate

Gary Cohen, an official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the administration has not been tracking how many of the Obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured.

“That's not a data point we are really collecting in any sort of systematic way,” Cohen told an audience at a health policy conference in Washington.

However, a separate poll from Gallup shows that the uninsured rate is at its lowest rate in the last five years—and the pollsters say Obamacare may deserve part of the credit. Of course, the uninsured rate is also tied to the lower unemployment rate, which could also explain the decline.

Still, the Bankrate survey found one bright spot for the White House—about 66 percent of young people between the ages of 18-29 said they are planning to sign up for coverage. This is crucial since the Obama administration has stressed from the beginning the importance of enrolling a strong mix of young and healthy people to offset the costs for older, sicker Americans.

Through February, young people made up about 27 percent of total enrollees--well below the White House’s 40 percent benchmark. Still, administration officials have repeatedly said they expect a crush of young people to sign up ahead of the March 31 deadline.

Related: Uninsured Still Unaware of Obamacare Deadline

Under the law’s individual mandate, those who do not sign up for health coverage before March 31, will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income. However, under rules issued by the administration, millions of people will likely be exempt from paying that penalty through a provision called the “hardship exemption,” which was extended last week through 2016.

This allows anyone who believes they will have a “hardship in obtaining insurance,” including homeless people, or those who have foreclosed upon, can apply for the exemption.

Critics of the provision say it is too ambiguous and could potentially allow anyone to skirt around the penalty.

“Quietly, without any fanfare, there’s a real question about whether the White House has just abandoned the individual mandate, the heart of Obamacare itself,” Boehner said a news conference last week. “This is a huge public policy decision that could affect millions of Americans.”

Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:###3194||Healthcare

The Washington Post heralds the arrival of the new Republican plan for a post ObamaCare-world:

House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health-care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills. But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,” with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents. “We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in an interview. “We’ve got all of these bills out there, so we’re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.”

The key phrase here is “the first time this year.” Republicans have put forth several other alternatives over the past four years, including a few other working-group products that were meant to be the party’s “official alternative” to ObamaCare. But the media let Democrats get away with pretending none of these plans existed. One of President Obama’s most frequently repeated, and categorically false, talking points is that nobody has any alternative suggestions to his disastrous Affordable Care Act. In the very same Washington Post article that describes the 2014 Republican alternative, Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) is quoted pretending the new plan doesn’t exist.

So Republican leaders are basically surfing on the media tide by treating this as the grand unveiling of a brand-new package, even though most of the (quite excellent) ideas they’re teasing have been part of earlier proposals Democrats were able to wish away into the cornfield. This might prove to be an effective bit of political and media judo, because 2014 feels like a brand-new shuffle and cut of the electoral cards, and voters will see the official Republican plan as an entirely fresh and new replacement for the widely hated ACA. (The Post tries to buck up lil’ campers on the Democrat reservation by citing an ostensibly reassuring poll that has “support for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly”… to 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproval.)

The new Republican plan will debut amid much buzz about President Obama’s falling approval ratings, public disgust with the endless and nakedly political revisions to the ACA, and the meaning of the special election in Florida’s District 13. The underdog Republican victory in that race might have persuaded the leadership it’s time to bring out a plan they can run with, in unison, during the midterm elections. Until now, it has been thought that exposing a GOP alternative to Democrat attacks could be a tactical mistake, giving Dems a chance to change the subject away from the ongoing ObamaCare disaster. Some conservative strategists evidently still feel that way, but others think it will be difficult to fully capitalize on the public revolt against ObamaCare without a solid alternative on the table.

If the House package draws wide acclaim once its details are unveiled, the next step will be to get Senate Republicans on board. If the party’s efforts are split between too many conflicting alternatives, their signals will all be lost in media static – they should have learned that by now. On the other hand, every headline-grabbing ObamaCare horror story gives them another chance to say, “Under our plan, these things won’t happen,” coupled with frequent reminders of all those broken ObamaCare promises and absurdly inaccurate predictions.

Barack Obama is illegally waiving huge chunks of the Affordable Care Act just to keep his party alive during the 2014 election. That’s a terrific setup for the GOP to come together behind a superior alternative proposal… a law so good the government might actually obey it.###3195||Sponsored

A navigational radar on Indonesia's National Search and Rescue boat shows details during a search in the Andaman sea area around northern tip of Indonesia's Sumatra island for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 on March 17, 2014

Clarification that the voice was most likely that of First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid came during a press conference at which Malaysian officials hit back at "irresponsible" suggestions that they had misled the public -- and passengers' relatives -- over what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and Fariq, his co-pilot, have become a primary focus of the investigation, with one of the key questions being who was in control of the aircraft when it veered off course about an hour into its flight to Beijing.

The nonchalant-sounding last message from the cockpit -- "All right, good night" -- came around the time that two of the plane's crucial signalling systems were manually disabled.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's final words.

The transponder -- which relays a plane's location -- was switched off just two minutes after he spoke, and a few minutes later the aircraft turned back on its flight path.

Yahya said it was not clear precisely when the ACARS system, which sends a signal every 30 minutes, was disabled. Officials had previously maintained it was manually turned off before the final cockpit message.

The Malaysian authorities have stressed that the backgrounds of all the passengers and crew were being checked, as well as engineers who may have worked on the plane before takeoff.

But Michael McCaul, chair of the US House Homeland Security Committee, said US intelligence briefings had seemed to lead "towards the cockpit, with the pilot himself, and co-pilot".

The plane went missing early on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard, spawning a massive international search across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean that has turned up no trace of wreckage.

- 'Contradictory information' -

China's damning assessments of Malaysia's crisis management continued Monday.

Premier Li Keqiang, in a phone conversation, asked his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak to provide more detailed information about the missing flight "in a timely, accurate and comprehensive manner", state news agency Xinhua reported.

The state-controlled China Daily said the "contradictory and piecemeal information Malaysia Airlines and its government have provided has made search efforts difficult and the entire incident even more mysterious".

Relatives of the Chinese passengers also voiced anger and frustration after a meeting with airline officials in Beijing.

"Only the Malaysia government knows the truth. They've been talking nonsense since the beginning," said Wen Wancheng, whose son was on Flight 370.

At Monday's press briefing, Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein reacted angrily when a foreign journalist suggested Malaysia should apologise for its handling of the crisis.

"I think it is very irresponsible of you to say that," he shot back.

Twenty-six countries are now involved in searching for the jet after satellite and military radar data projected two dauntingly large corridors the plane might have flown through.

The northern corridor stretches in an arc over south and central Asia, while the other swoops deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.

Satellite and radar data from countries in the northern corridor should allow investigators to confirm within "two or three days" whether it crashed in that area, a foreign member of the investigative team told AFP.

On Monday, the central Asian states of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan said there had been no sightings in their airspace.

Malaysia announced that it was deploying its navy and air force to the southern corridor, where Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said his country would take the lead in searching a vast area off its west coast.

Commander William Marks, spokesman for the United States' Seventh Fleet, said his navy's P-8 Poseidon aircraft would also head to western Australia. He added that the USS Kid and MH-60R helicopters had completed their search of the Andaman Sea.

Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates said it was providing two planes, according to WAM state news agency.

Three officials from France's civil aviation accident investigation agency arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to share their experiences of the search for Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

The "black boxes" from that crash were eventually recovered nearly two years later from a depth of more than 3,800 meters (12,500 feet).

- Political dimension? -

Malaysian police have searched both pilots' homes and are examining a flight simulator that Captain Zaharie, 53, had assembled at his home.

Associates say Zaharie was an active supporter of Malaysia's political opposition headed by veteran politician Anwar Ibrahim.

In a highly controversial case, Anwar was convicted of sodomy -- illegal in Muslim Malaysia -- just hours before MH370 took off.

But friends said Zaharie exhibited no extreme views.

Fariq, meanwhile, was accused in an Australian television report of allowing two young South African women into the cockpit of a plane he piloted in 2011, breaching security rules imposed after the 9/11 attacks in the United States.

But acquaintances have attested to his good character, and reports said he planned to wed his flight-school sweetheart.###3197||Why did this happen?

Its projected valuation is as outrageous as expected. King (and its existing shareholders) plan to sell more than twenty-two million shares at a price of twenty-one to twenty-four dollars apiece, which would give the company a projected market cap of around seven billion dollars. That’s two billion more than Zynga’s market cap, and, even more strikingly, just a few billion dollars less than the market caps of the gaming giants Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.

The enormous profits that King is raking in from Candy Crush makes the company look reasonably priced on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, with a trailing P/E ratio of just 13.3. At Yahoo Finance, Aaron Pressman argues that when you compare King’s valuation to those of other tech high-flyers (which often have P/Es above a hundred), there’s a case to be made that it’s undervalued. The problem, of course, is that this assumes that King’s current profits are sustainable, not just for a couple of years but for the foreseeable future. Price-to-earnings ratios are crude tools at best, and they’re useful only if the “earnings” part can be counted on to be stable or growing. In King’s case, as I argued in my column, there’s just no reason to assume that Candy Crush—which brings in eighty per cent of King’s revenue—is going to keep generating enormous piles of cash for years to come. Nor can it be expected that King will come up with sequels that replicate Candy Crush’s success.

When you buy shares in a public company, you’re buying a share of future profits, and the future of any company that’s reliant on a single faddish product for so much of its revenue is inherently uncertain—too uncertain for investors to confidently accept a seven-billion-dollar valuation. I have no doubt that investors will snap this offering up: the market is willing to value Zynga, which has lost six hundred million dollars over the past three years, at five billion dollars. King looks like a bargain by comparison. But this is a pure gamble.

Pressman alludes to the fact that there are successful video-game franchises. But, almost without exception, those franchises are titles in which companies invest huge sums of money, and many of them (like sports franchises) have a natural upgrade cycle built in: people buy the new Madden like clockwork when football season starts again. King has yet to demonstrate that it’ll be able to do anything similar with Candy Crush.

King’s offering does make clear just why the company is going public—to allow its current shareholders to make a whole lot of money. The company itself is planning to raise about three hundred and twenty-five million dollars. Shareholders are going to sell shares worth another hundred and fifty million, which represents a very nice payday, particularly since many of those shares will be sold by individuals. (The private-equity firm Apax Partners, which owns nearly half the company, is going to dilute its stake by only four per cent.) Going public, as I argued in my piece, still seems like a mistake for a company that has more than enough money in the bank to stay afloat for years to come (and is going to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the next couple of years), and that operates a business ill-suited to the demands of shareholders, who want consistent and steadily growing profits. But there are few better ways to make a lot of people really rich than a high-priced I.P.O., and, looking at these numbers, it’s not hard to understand why King’s current shareholders are happy to take the money.

Libya's parliament has ousted the prime minister in a vote of confidence, after his government was embarrassed when a militia controlling an eastern port defied Tripoli's authority by trying to sell oil.

The chamber named the defence minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, as an interim prime minister until a replacement for the embattled Ali Zidan is found.

The "no" vote won the support of 121 MPs out of the approximately 180 that remain in the parliament, according to one MP.

Mr Zidan, whose ousting had been seen as a matter of time to many Libyans, had no immediate public reaction to the vote.

He was elected in 2012 as the first prime minister after the 2011 overthrow and killing of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

He has had the backing of the liberal-leaning National Forces Alliance against a bloc led by the Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, although parliament is divided as much on regional lines as ideological ones.

Col Gaddafi's 40-year rule left Libya with few strong state institutions, and Mr Zidan has presided over a government that has little authority and is frequently subjected to humiliations. In the absence of a strong military and police force, it relies on militias to keep order - but many defy the government, with one of them briefly abducting Mr Zidan himself last year.

The Islamist-led bloc has long wanted to oust him, although until now it could not drum up the votes. It was not clear if parliament changed sides but Mr Zidan in recent days has appeared particularly helpless. He confessed to reporters on Saturday that the nation's military does not carry out his orders and complained that "everyone is working against the government."

The latest crisis is linked to an autonomy movement in Libya's east, home to most of its oil. Several months ago, a militia seized the key port of al-Sidra and in recent days, the group attempted to load oil into a North Korean-flagged tanker that docked there without government permission.

The government said on Monday that its forces had taken control of the tanker, but the militia denied this.

Underlying Libya's crisis is a dispute over the interim parliament, which reached the end of its mandate in February. Islamists want to extend its term while the other bloc wants new elections.###3207||Empty###3208||Empty###3209||Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signalled on Thursday that his government will not ride to the rescue of every troubled investment by saying some loan defaults are "hard to avoid" in what he called a challenging economic environment.

The Yomiuri Shimbun's English-language Japan News reports that the attacks in early February reached 150,000 DDOS hits per second, “mostly from servers in the United States and Europe”.

Japan News notes that it doesn't require any special skill to launch a DDOS attack, citing Tetsutaro Uehara, a professor of information security at Ritsumeikan University: “DDoS attacks can be done without high-level hacking techniques.”

Referring to attacks on Slovenian Bitstamp and Canada's Flexcoin, Uehara said: “It is possible that copycats turned their eyes on other exchanges after weaknesses in Mt. Gox’s system were found.”

By February 10, Mt Gox threw its hands up in the air and suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. It later emerged that attackers had found a way to exploit the Mt Gox code to steal 850,000 Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Of the stolen Bitcoins, 750,000 belonged to customers and 100,000 were Mt Gox's own holdings.

Mt Gox is under investigation in the US and Japan. ®

Reporting sales and earnings ahead of expectations, Dick’s Sporting Goods says its omnichannel strategy is paying off. And with its new “Sports Matter” campaign, announced last week at SXSW, the Pittsburgh-based retailer is shifting its brand advertising dollars into the broader support of kids’ athletics, addressing the funding crisis facing its core audience.

“We’ve been working on this crowdfunding campaign for about a year,” Ryan Eckel, VP-brand marketing, tells Marketing Daily, “and while we inherently knew that massive benefits come from sports, it’s been really powerful to quantify them.” For example, he says, 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs played a high school sport, and kids who do so are four times as likely to go on to college. “But opportunities are disappearing fast,” he says, with 60% of kids participating in team sports now having to pay in order to play. And by 2020, an estimated 27% of high schools will not offer athletics.

While he declined to give the dollar amount of the marketing effort, he says the company is moving its brand budget into the “Sports Matter” TV ads, created by Anomaly. The goal is to help threatened teams raise $2 million, which will then be matched by a $2 million grant from Dick’s Sporting Goods Foundation.

So far, he says the response has strong, “and we can see activity increase whenever a spot runs.”

In order to participate, teams must serve kids in grades K through 12, be affiliated with a school, nonprofit or league, and have been eliminated, at risk of elimination or never able to form because of lack of funds. “We wanted to focus on the sharpest outcome, the extreme outcome, when entire teams disappear,” he says. “With that clear an identity, we thought the campaign would get more traction.”

The crowdfunding element is important. “If we just write these teams a check and then go away, that’s not a sustainable solution,” he says. Once the funding has been awarded, he adds, teams will work with Up2Us, an online organization that coaches parents on how to build effective extracurricular organizations.

Jon Gruden, a former NFL coach and now an ESPN analyst, is an ambassador for the program.

Another part of the effort, Eckel says, is a partnership with Tribeca Digital Studios and director Judd Ehrlich, filming “We Could be King,” a documentary that follows the merger of two rival Philadelphia high schools forced to merge football teams. That film is set to premiere next month at the Tribeca Film Festival, and will also air on ESPN2.

Separately, the company says its net sales rose nearly 8% in the fourth quarter, to $1.9 billion. On a same-store basis, sales increased 7.3%, and net income climbed to $138.6 million. Sales “exceeded our expectations," says Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO, in its release. "As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omni-channel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings."###3215||“A supplier raised with the Company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop.

But the prospect of wider swings amid a slowing economy could prompt exporters to stash more cash offshore, accelerating a slowdown in credit growth in China and further squeezing strapped borrowers.

After nudging the value of the renminbi down by more than 1.6% against the U.S. dollar since January to its lowest level in 15 years, the People’s Bank of China said over the weekend that the currency would be able to trade as much as 2% higher or lower than the daily rate it sets.

Currencies rarely move so much in a single day, particularly not China’s tightly controlled yuan. But unlikely doesn’t mean impossible — so one can reasonably expect Chinese companies and the banks that service them to start hedging against the risk of higher volatility in the currency’s rate.###3218||Empty###3219||We’ve recently covered the news that more people are foregoing car ownership than ever before, so it would make sense that public transit is becoming more and more popular at the same time. Now there’s data to prove it.

The American Public Transportation Association’s latest figures, released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years. That amounts to a whopping 10.65 billion passenger trips, beating the previous record in 1956 and a more recent peak in 2008, when gas cost more than $4 a gallon and 10.59 million trips were taken.

This time around high gas prices aren’t the main reason, and the trend is more about a basic shift in attitudes about how people travel in their cities, as well as a generally strong urban economy. Michael Melaniphy, president of the advocacy group, told the New York Times:

“Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,” Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.”

From 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association’s data.

Cities should be paying attention, especially as many aim to attract young people to live and work in their borders. Young people traveling more often at “off-peak” times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported. Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.

These are all reasons for cities to invest more in subways, buses, and rail systems though that is sure to raise the hackles of dedicated drivers. It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.###3220||This Page Is Under Construction - Coming Soon!

Moments after Herbalife made the announcement, its stock price plunged. At 1:51 p.m., it had lost 12 percent of its value.

Bloomberg explains that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman accused the company of running a pyramid scheme. Bloomberg adds:



"The probe marks an achievement for Ackman, who in 2012 made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife's shares and started working to persuade regulators to shut the company down, saying it misleads distributors, misrepresents sales figures and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. The company has repeatedly denied Ackman's allegations and won allies including billionaire Carl Icahn. "'Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,' the company said in the statement."



NPR's Planet Money took a look at Ackman's claims back in January. As they reported, the "multilevel marketing" scheme used by Herbalife isn't new. Amway and Avon use the same kind of structure. Essentially, distributors make more money by making other people distributors.

But whether its illegal presents a complicated question:



"Ackman argues that Herbalife is all about recruiting new distributors, and not about selling weight loss shakes and vitamins to real customers. "Not surprisingly, Herbalife disagrees. The company says it has millions of customers around the world. The CEO went on CNBC and accused Ackman of 'market manipulation' — a typical accusation CEOs hurl against shorts. "So, who's right here? How hard can it be to tell whether a giant company is a pyramid scheme? In this case, weirdly, it's really hard. "For a company like Herbalife, the difference between being a legitimate business and being a pyramid scheme comes down to what happens on the ground with all those people who signed up to sell products. "If it's a legitimate business, they're mostly selling the products to people who actually want to use them."

U.S. Navy SEALs have taken control of a commercial tanker that had been seized by three armed Libyans earlier this month.

No one was hurt in the Sunday night operation, the Pentagon said.

The tanker, Morning Glory, is carrying oil owned by Libya’s National Oil Company.

It sailed last week from the rebel-held port of As-Sidra in the nation’s east. Libyan forces fired on the vessel but were called off by the U.S. Navy, fearing an environmental disaster.

The situation remains unsettled in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

In this case, the issue centers around the oil-rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular, Ibrahim Jadran. The militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports. But last July, Jadran and his men seized them, blocking oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region.

He said he acted because the government is corrupt.

The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please.

DETROIT, March 13 — General Motors Co got its first internal report on ignition-switch problems in small cars in 2001, while developing the Saturn Ion, the carmaker said in a letter to US regulators.

GM thought it had fixed the ignition-switch defect, the carmaker said in a supplemental report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration yesterday. Then in 2003, service technicians found that an owner with a heavy key ring was experiencing engine stalls while driving. The flaw, linked to 12 deaths, led to the recall last month of 1.6 million cars.

The company filed the new information with NHTSA on what it did to address the problem to better explain why it expanded the recall to six US models from two, roughly doubling the number of cars covered, Greg Martin, a spokesman for Detroit-based GM, said in an e-mail. The details concern the company’s attempts to investigate ignition-switch issues in the Ion, the Saturn Sky, the Chevrolet HHR and the Pontiac Solstice.

“Today’s GM is fully committed to learning from the past while embracing the highest standards for quality and performance now and in the future,” Martin said.

GM later used the same part in the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

The 2001 testing failure disclosed by GM is earlier than when the carmaker said it learned of flaws in the Cobalt. Previously, the company said it had investigated in 2004 a consumer complaint and engineers were able to induce an engine stall. GM officials have said the problem was investigated at that time and no action was taken.

Frontal crashes

“We don’t yet really know at what point this matter was escalated to past upper-level members of management, and how they dealt with it,” said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book in Irvine, California. “It’s also murky as to when current management learned about some of this.”

The flaw caused ignition switches to slip out of position and cut off engine power and deactivate air bags.

The largest US automaker said it knows of eight frontal- impact crashes and four deaths involving Ions that may be linked to the defect. It knows of three frontal crashes involving the HHR that may be related, which caused three injuries but no fatalities, it said.

The recalled cars are the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevy HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice, 2007 Saturn Sky, 2007 Pontiac G5 — all US models — plus the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit marketed in Canada and the 2007 Open GT in Europe.

GM fell less than 1 per cent to US$34.86 (RM114.38) at 4pm in New York. On Tuesday the shares tumbled 5.1 per cent, their worst one- day drop since March 2012, cutting the company’s market value by more than US$3 billion.

“The difference between 10 or 12 years, if I’m a consumer, doesn’t make me feel any better or any worse, necessarily, about what happened,” Kelley Blue Book’s Gutierrez said of the evolving timeline. “What’s important for consumers at this point is what GM is doing to make it right.” — Bloomberg###3227||Empty###3228||By Anshuman Daga and Yantoultra Ngui

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) – The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering a area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane – an informal “all right, good night” – was spoken after the system, known as “ACARS”, was shut down.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system – a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status – had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”

VAST SEARCH CORRIDORS

Police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests it could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.

Aviation officials in Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan – as well as Taliban militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan – said they knew nothing about the whereabouts of the plane.

“The idea that the plane flew through Indian airspace for several hours without anyone noticing is bizarre,” a defense ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are seeking to oust foreign troops and set up an Islamic state, said the missing plane had nothing to do with them.

“It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went,” he said. “So we also do not have any information as it is an external issue.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbor to “immediately” expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said diplomatic notes had been sent to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force were also searching the southern corridor, he said, and U.S. P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft were being sent to Perth, in Western Australia, to help scour the ocean.

FOCUS ON CREW

The plane’s disappearance has baffled investigators and aviation experts. It vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities believe that, as the plane crossed the northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned west.

That has focused attention on the crew. Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, Hishammuddin said: “We are looking at it.” But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.

Police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programs were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practice flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.

“Based on what we have so far, we cannot see the terrorism link here,” he said. “We looked at known terror or extremist groups in Southeast Asia. The links are not there.”

NORTH OR SOUTH?

Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia. Three French civil aviation experts involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009 arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to help.

A source familiar with official U.S. assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor.

###3233||There’s a lot of talk about exploiting the US energy boom to undermine Putin and Russia. This boom may have profound effects in the long run, but there is nothing that can be done now that can materially harm Putin in to punish him for his anschluss in Crimea, or subsequent aggressive moves he may make.

Yes, the US restrictions on exports of natural gas and crude oil are economically idiotic, even absent geopolitical considerations. But even if those bans were eliminated tomorrow (a huge if, given he who sits in the White House-or golfs in Key Largo, as the case may be) Europe’s energy situation would not change one whit.

It would be possible to start moving large quantities of crude if the export ban were lifted, but this would be largely offset by a decline in US exports of refined products. A major effect of the ban is to distort where crude is refined, not the total supply of crude and refined products (especially in the short run). The major effect of the ban at present is to benefit US refiners who refine crude that is selling at below world prices because of the ban and export the products. One study estimates that eliminating the ban would drop world oil prices by cents not dollars.

With respect to natural gas the situation is even less favorable. Even if DOE granted all pending LNG export licenses, it will be years before product will start flowing. Cheniere received the first license, in May, 2011, and its facility will not come on line until late-2015 at the earliest. The company had a head start because it was converting an existing facility built to import LNG: other facilities will take longer to build because they are starting from scratch.

The long run impact of eliminating the export ban depends on the elasticity of supply of gas in the US. If it is very elastic at current price levels, then yes, once the ban is lifted world prices will fall substantially, and Russia will be hit hard by that. If supply is less elastic, the impact will be far smaller. The elasticity of supply will depend crucially on technological factors, including the suitability of new formations to fracking and horizontal drilling, the depletion rates of wells, and the rate of technological innovation. All of these factors are quite uncertain, and if the experience of the past decade says anything, it says be leery about making predictions about natural gas supply.

In brief: US energy export policy is stupid, but fixing the stupidity will have no appreciable impact on Russia for years.

Similarly, fixing stupid European policies on energy (e.g., fracking bans, massive renewables subsidies like Energiewende) should be done for reasons independent of geopolitics, and even if done tomorrow will have no material impact on European energy prices or Russian energy revenues for years to come.

The main way to impose substantial costs on Russia today via energy would be to impose trade sanctions. Given the fact that the oil market is essentially global in scope, and that coordinating a global boycott of Russian oil would be virtually impossible, natural gas is a more feasible target. Europe could boycott Russian gas unilaterally, and there is no effective way for Russia to sell that gas to Asia or anywhere else.

There is a substantial asymmetry here. Russia depends heavily on gas exports. Approximately 25 percent of the Russian government’s revenue comes from Gazprom. The knock on effect on the Russian economy would likely be huge, as severe fiscal constraints would likely put substantial strains on the Russian banking system.

Yes, Europe would be hurt by higher prices and lower consumption of gas. But gas comprises a far lower percentage of European expenditures than it does of Russian income, meaning that the hit on Europe would be far smaller. Moreover, some of the impact could be mitigated by substantially increasing coal imports, increased Norwegian production, and some diversion of LNG from Asia to Europe, especially to the UK (which has excess LNG import capacity and could use LNG to displace North Sea gas which it could then pipe to Europe). Moreover, winter is ending, and the cost of a supply interruption in the spring and summer would be far less than the cost in the winter.

But I doubt that is going to happen, because of another asymmetry. The asymmetry in political will. Old Europe has no stomach for a confrontation with Putin over Crimea, Ukraine, or much of anything else. (And yes, Donald Rumsfeld was an a$$hole-a claim I can vouch for based on family experience-but the Old Europe vs. New Europe formulation does capture an essential truth, especially where Russia is involved.) This lack of intestinal fortitude means that Old Europe-and especially Germany-is unwilling to pay any price to punish Putin. Talk is free, and that’s all they are willing to pay.

And don’t think for a moment that Putin hasn’t based his plans on exactly that calculation.

In an attempt to scare off any attempt at sanctions, Russia has threatened retaliation: Lavrov has told Kerry any such moves will “boomerang.” Other Russian officials have said that Russia can insulate itself from the west, thereby making it immune to any sanctions.

The retaliation that has been threatened includes expropriation of the assets of western companies. A quite predictable Russian reaction, and typically self-destructive. Any such expropriation would just cement Russia’s reputation as a lawless country where foreign investors rush in where angels fear to tread. Russian equity valuations would crater, and direct investment would too. Capital flight would accelerate. The costs inflicted on Russia would dwarf those inflicted on the US and Europe, and would last for years.

Other that that, a great plan! Another major asymmetry: any Russian retaliation would harm Russia far more than Europe or the US. Some boomerang.

It reminds me of the old joke about the genie who grants the muzhik one wish, with one condition: anything the muzhik wishes for he gets, but his neighbor gets double. The muzhik thinks for a minute, then says: “I wish that you pluck out one of my eyes.”

All that said, I do not think that economic sanctions in the form of boycotting Russian energy or other exports, or cutting off imports (e.g., of drilling equipment) are the most effective, or the least costly, way of imposing costs on Putin and the elite on whom he depends. As I have said since Georgia, 2008, the best way to attack Putin and the elite is to go after their money in the west. (This policy is getting widespread publicity now. I will lay claim to being a very early advocate.)

Such a measure is targeted on those who make the decisions, rather than Russia and Russians generally: as such, it could not be used by Putin to claim that the west was waging a war on Russia. Indeed, it could undermine his political support not just among the elite who would be paying the price for his adventures, but among the broader population who are already disgusted by corruption and who would be unlikely to have any sympathy for that corruption being exposed, and the ill-gotten gains being seized. The cost on western economies would very small indeed. It would represent a victory for the rule of law.

But this would impose some costs on some very connected people in the west. Moreover, precisely because it would strike so deeply at Putin it would cause him to lose his sh*t, and fear of that causes the Euros to shrink away from it in terror.

But this is something the US can pursue unilaterally. Yes, given that most dirty Russian money is in Europe or the Caribbean, these measures would be much more effective if the Europeans participated. But the US still can wield considerable power (note how it forced Switzerland to heel on tax issues-not something that I agree with, btw, just pointing out that the US has leverage) and indeed, the mere threat of exposing what it uncovers could make the Europeans think twice.

But again, there is a lack of will. Hope drives policy: “If we concede Crimea to Putin, he will stop.”

In sum, there is a powerful policy tool at our disposal. A far better tool than is available in most such circumstances. Other tools (sanctions) are more costly. Yet other supposed tools-increasing US energy exports-are chimerical.

If we’re serious, we’ll use it. But I have my doubts that we’re serious. If Europe (and to a lesser degree the US) has demonstrated anything in recent years, it is that they are past masters at kicking the can. Crimea, Ukraine, and Putin are likely to be just another can.###3234||27 Mins Ago

The consumer price index rose 0.1 percent, matching the January gain. Food prices, rising 0.4 percent, accounted for more than half of the increase.

Energy prices fell 0.5 percent as a drop in gasoline prices outweighed sharp rises in fuel oil and natural gas prices.

Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile month-over-month, core CPI rose 0.1 percent for the third consecutive month.

Analysts on average had forecast a 0.2 percent rise in CPI.

Compared with a year ago, February consumer prices increased 1.1 percent, slowing from 1.6 percent in January. Core CPI rose 1.6 percent from February 2013.

The latest consumer prices data pointed to continued subdued inflationary pressures as the Federal Reserve opens a two-day monetary policy Tuesday.

The Fed's preferred inflation indicator, the personal consumption expenditures price index, was up 1.2 percent year-on-year in January, well below the central bank's 2.0 percent target for price stability.###3237||AFP, WASHINGTON

New US Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is expected to stick to the game plan when she chairs her first monetary policy meeting this week, further cutting back economic stimulus.

Yet, six weeks after inheriting former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s mantle, she is also under the gun to make a pivot in the way the Fed has been signaling its intentions.

Handled well, that delicate shift in how the Fed foreshadows an eventual rate hike could assuage markets.

Communicated badly, it could result in volatile movements and leave the new Fed boss on the back foot.

WEATHER IMPACT

The first meeting under Yellen’s lead of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), tomorrow and Wednesday, is expected to conclude that unusually harsh winter storms were mainly behind the slowdown in economic activity in December last year to last month.

The Fed has cut the program by US$20 billion to US$65 billion a month since the beginning of the year, and another US$10 billion cut could be decided this week.

Yellen already showed her bias toward the weather explanation when she testified before the US Senate on Feb. 27.

Taking note of the poor data, she said she “wouldn’t want to jump to conclusions.”

However, she added: “It is clear that unseasonably cold weather has played some role.”

A week later, the US Fed Beige Book survey of regional economies, important content for the FOMC policy meeting, mentioned the weather 119 times in explaining sluggish activity in much of the country.

REBOUND

A modest rebound in retail sales data last month suggested that there is some pent-up demand, and analysts hope this month and next month will show a rebound in the economy.

“We expect catch-up in March, leading to good momentum heading in to the second quarter,” Jim O’Sullivan at High Frequency Economics said.

Yellen, who has always stayed behind the scenes during her three years as Bernanke’s deputy, will face the media on Wednesday when she announces the FOMC’s policy decision.

With the bond-buying taper expected to remain on track, the challenge will be to explain how the committee will adjust the communication of its expectations: essentially, how it signals to the market when it plans to begin raising its key interest rate, held at a rock-bottom zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.

At the end of 2012, the FOMC set specific thresholds for when it could begin lifting the rate: 2 percent for inflation and a 6.5 percent unemployment rate.

Most policymakers did not think those levels would be breached until next year, and the current Fed outlook for a rate hike is later next year.###3238||Empty###3239||Empty###3240||By: Eamonn Sheridan

Mar. 19, Starbucks will update its app to make it easier to navigate and also add digital tipping for the first time. Other features include “Shake to Pay” which instantly loads your Starbucks card up from anywhere within the app.

After paying, users will get a notification encouraging them to also pay between $.50 to $2 in the store’s virtual tip jar. Even more interesting is users can adjust the tip for up to two hours after your purchase. So in case your drink is absolutely terrible or amazing you’ll be able to either bump up your tip or lower it and every purchase is saved as a digital receipt you can access later on. According to The Verge tipping option will roll out next week, it won’t be available on every corner. While there’s around 11,000 Starbucks stores in the US, the company says tipping will only be available at 7,000 of the company-operated locations.

On March 5, Bouygues said it submitted an offer to Vivendi to start negotiations to merge Bouygues Telecom and Vivendi's SFR unit. The offer valued SFR at 14.5 billion euros pre synergies and at 19 billion euros post synergies.

Following this, Bouygues and Bouygues Telecom entered into exclusive talks to sell part of its mobile phone network and a portfolio of frequencies to smaller peer Ilaid SA's Free in a deal valued at up to $2.5 billion.

The deal with Free will enable Bouygues to alleviate anti-trust concerns on the merger between Bouygues Telecom and SFR, and aims to preserve strong, infrastructure-based competition in France. The sale of network and frequencies is conditional on the merger between Bouygues Telecom and SFR being completed.

Further, earlier this week, cable holding company Altice S.A. confirmed that on March 5 it made a fully financed cash and share offer to Vivendi for a combination of SFR and Altice's subsidiary Numericable. The offer involved a payment to Vivendi in the form of 10.9 billion euros in cash and Numericable shares representing 32 percent of the share capital of new Numericable-SFR group. It remains valid until March 14.

Bouygues said today that it is now offering Vivendi 11.3 billion euros in cash, equating to an increase of 800 million euros, as well as a 43 percent interest in the new entity. This new offer values SFR at 15.5 billion euros pre-synergies and at nearly 20 billion euros factoring in all the synergies.

As part of this improved offer, Bouygues' interest in the new entity following the merger would be 52 percent compared to 49 percent in the previous offer.

An IPO of the new entity is planned as soon as the merger is completed. This offers Vivendi an immediate opportunity to monetize its interest. Bouygues said it is committed to facilitate the liquidity of Vivendi's interest in the new entity.

The new Bouygues Telecom-SFR entity is expected to create a major French digital communications group with significant investment capacity, particularly for the roll-out of optical fiber and to develop innovation and quality of service for the benefit of consumers.

Bouygues is losing 0.70 percent in early morning trade at 31.80 euros. Vivendi is up 0.7 percent at 20.29 euros.

Business News###3243||Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pushed his message that there’s no rush to increase U.K. interest rates, saying there may be more slack in the economy than the central bank’s calculations show.



Speaking to lawmakers today, he said the amount of spare capacity is "at the upper end" of the 1% to 1.5% of gross domestic product estimated by the BOE in its Inflation Report last month. His comments underline a key area of divergence among officials, after policy maker Martin Weale said the level of slack may be overstated.



The central bank refocused its interest-rate policy, known as forward guidance, on spare capacity last month. The revamp came after unemployment fell faster than forecast toward the 7 percent threshold it set for considering a rate increase.



Noting comments by Deputy Governor Charlie Bean yesterday that the key rate may settle at about 2% to 3% once tightening begins, he indicated agreement with that outlook. The BOE’s benchmark interest rate is currently at a record-low 0.5%



Carney also said today it will take "several" interest-rate increases before the BOE begins unwinding its 375-billion-pound quantitative-easing program.



The strongest economic expansion since 2007 has shifted investor focus to when the BOE’s unprecedented stimulus will be removed. As part of the next phase of guidance, the debate on the timing of rate increases will hinge on policy makers’ assessment of slack in the economy.



###3244||New York - Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.

MtGox&39;s lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm&39;s customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.

Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox&39;s bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.###3245||Empty###3246||16.50 That's where we'll close up the blog for the night.

EU banking union faces delays as ministers fail to agree

15.16 The odds of a final deal on EU banking union between the individual member states and the European Parliament are narrowing as the meeting between the bloc's finance ministers drags on with no sign of a deal. The stand-off centres around the most controversial pillar of banking union - the single resolution mechanism - a proposed common fund which would be used to wind down or rescue ailing eurozone banks.

The idea is that the fund will be built up over the course of a number of years with levies charged on eurozone banks. But peripheral states like Spain are pushing for EU governments to provide guarantees that if a bank needed bailed out before the fund was fully built up, that it could still access rescue money. Germany on the other hand has refused to pledge any taxpayer support for the fund.

FCA is not investigationg BoE for forex rigging allegations

14.55 BREAKING: The Financial Conduct Authority has said it is not investigating the Bank of England for forex rigging allegations. Last week the Bank announced that it had suspended a member of staff in relation to its internal investigation into forex rigging over possible breaches of its "internal control processes".

The Bank of England will never unwind QE, nor should it

14.30 That is the bold claim by our very own Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, which he says Carney pretty much admitted himself this morning as part of his very long grilling by MPs.

He says Britain has just carried out the greatest victimless crimes in modern financial history. It is in effect wiping out public debt worth 20pc to 25pc of GDP – on the sly – without inflicting serious macroeconomic damage or frightening global bond markets.

Governor Mark Carney more or less acknowledged this morning that the Bank of England will never reverse its £375bn of Gilts purchases. Quite right too.

“Any unwinding of QE should come after several adjustments to rates,” he told the Treasury Select Committee. The word “any” tells us what we need to know.

This follows comments by Deputy Governor Charlie Bean yesterday that the Bank will “only contemplate selling back Gilts once the recovery is on a firm path.” He admitted that some holdings may never be sold.

The Bank has come a long way from the early days of QE when any such suggestion was treated as an outrageous smear. There was a mantra that helicopter money requires a hoover afterwards to vacuum it up.

But in a deflationary world there is no clear imperative to do so. The Bank can sit on its Gilts forever. These can be switched in zero-coupon bonds in perpetuity. The certificates can be put in a drawer and left to rot. The debt is eliminated in all but name.

Carney grilled on forex

14.12 After nearly five hours in the hot seat, it is over, and I'm sure noone is happier about that than Carney himself.

<noframe>Twitter: Louise Armitstead - Carney session with TSC ends after 4hrs40mins - phew.</noframe>

13.54 Things are getting heated now.

Back to those 2006 miuntes in which is says that there were concerns about market manipulation in the forex market.

Andrea Leadsom puts it to Carney and Fisher that those minutes should have set off alarm bells.

It is put to them that following the revelation of the Libor scandal the Bank should have gone back through minutes to look to see if there had been any concerns about rigging in other markets.

Fisher says those minutes "did not convey to me that markets were being rigged".

He goes on to say that it is not the job of the Bank to go hunting for manipulation, but will deal with it if it does come across it.

13.44 George Moodie takes his turn to ask questions, except they have already been asked so he warns that his could be a bit all over the place.

So Moodie says it seems as if Carney has managed to exit himself from the investigation and passed it over to the Bank's Court and also the FCA.

Carney responds to says it is the job of the FCA, as decided by parliament, that they investigate this.

This is extremely seriously. It is as serious as Libor, if not more so.

In my role as chairman of the FSB and as governor, I have had discussions with the heads of all other major central banks.

We are going to report to the leaders of the g20 on this issue, so we are taking it seriously.

He goes on to say again that the Bank is also addressing any issues internally.

We have spared no expense in conducting this and will spare no expense in completeing that investigation.

We will take the appropriate steps once we have all the information.

At same time will work at an international level to fix that.

13.34 Andy Love now asks Carney if the Bank can be confident that there wil not be any additional issues to come out from the forex investigation for the Bank.

Carney responds:

I am not aware of any additional issues but I’m acutely aware of our responsibility to complete a thorough investigation of all aspects of this issue.

It is incredibly important for the foreign exchange market and integrity of the bank of England.

I would not want to leave you with the impression that we have done something and will now relax.

Carney says again that the investigation will be very thorough and stringent to ensure that the Bank's integrity is not damaged.

We don’t just owe it to the people of ths country, but also to our employees who have acted with integrity and dedication.

We can’t come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England and we will not.

Carney says that while the investigation is taking place the Bank is putting in measures internally to reinforce the best aspects of the culture of the Bank.

13.27 Carney is asked for more details as to the grounds on which the Bank employee has been suspended.

Understandably Carney will not be drawn on this and says that the investigation was inline with the Bank's rigorous standards.

Again Carney is asked why the employee's line manager was not suspended or the subject of the investigation.

He answers:

We take the situation extremely seriously. We have conducted an investigation that has looked at not the actions of one individual employee but all relevant employees.

I make no judgement on that individual.

It is imperative we look at all aspects of the situation. We reconfirm the integrity and prudence and dedication of the ongoing employees of the Bank.

13.25 David Ruffley now asking the Bank to confirm when it first heard about the allegations.

Carney confirms his earlier answer of October 16.

Ruffley asks how it was communicated.

Carney says a colleague was informed but a market participant, who then told the governors who immediately met to discuss and then sought council within 48 hours.

Carney says the Bank did not carry out its own investigation before appointing Travers Smith as its legal council.

Ruffley asks why on February 11 the Bank's Oversight Committee took the lead on the investigation.

Carney explains that the first phase was to gather evidence, which he says was a very comprehensive effort to gather that - 14,00 emails, 21,000 chats and more. e pictuire as possible.

Once we came into possession of material which warranted intesification and led to suspension, the governors met, and at the next court meeting in March we told Court of our decision.

Then the oversight comimtte, without the executive, met immediately after that meeting and made the decision to take responsibility to investigation as they see fit.

13.16 So what's the plan for the Bank's investigation?

Carney says it will follow through the investigation, explain why if it finds there were failings and then take action to ensure those failings don't happen again.

One other thing we should do (may be others) – both for internal and external understanding is to more clearly establish what principles are around fair market.

It has to be a real market, not just about no market abuse but open to anyone who wants to be apart of it.

13.06 Carney is asked if the Financial Conduct Authority can investigate the Bank of England?

He responds:

It can and will investigate any individuals for any of these aspects (forex rigging).

Pat McFadden asks if the regulator can treat the central bank as it would any other high street banl:

Yes it can.

Indivuals at the institution under same scrutiny as at any institution.

Carney goes on to note that the Bank has no information that anyone from the Bank condoned, facilitiated or took part in market mainupulation.

He says the Bank holds it emplpyees to a higher standard than other institutions and following its review it had cause to suspend an employee.

12.54 Carney says the Bank first became aware that it could be involved in forex manipulation on October 16.

He says the Bank engaged legal council just 48 hours later.

12.49 Tyrie asks why the Bank released the name of the employee that has been suspended relating to forex rigging investigation.

Carney says the Bank did not release the name.

Tyrie asks if it was a leak.

Carney responds:

As you are no doubt aware, there is a very active press in this country, it;s a sign of a healthy democracy - people can speculate.

Carney goes on to say that he will not confirm if the person named in the press is the individual who has been suspended.

He adds:

I would take the opportunity that suspension is not a disciplinary action, it is an action to further the investigation that has been taken over by the oversight committee.

Tyrie asks Fisher if he considered suspending the employee's boss.

Fisher: No.

Tyrie asks why not?

Carney tries to respond but Tyrie says he wants to hear from Fisher.

Fisher cautious to say too much but says he has no reason to take further action.

Carney now allowed to speak. He says decision to suspend was taken by governors on the back of evidence found during the investigation.

12.43 We're back for the final part of Carney's marathon grilling session. This time it's on foreign exchange.

Carney grilled on economics of currency union

12.37 Another quick break- next up: how much did the Bank know about allegations of forex rigging?

12.30 Carney explains the concept of the "contingent liability" in any currency union - that is to say that a no bail out rule would not necessarily be watertight:

One of the risks is that there is a contingent liability that builds up e.g. eurozone. Everyone's familiar with events over last five years. There's no bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but, when push canme to shove, that was not credible. There were extraordinary efforts made by European officials to avoid [financial collapse in peripheral countries]. The issue for the rest of the UK would be: would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties? If it's not credible then the structure of the currency union is less than perfect but it's also taking on a contingent liability to the UK balance sheet.

These are all issues that need to be thought through in advance.

12.15 What if Scotland joined an EU banking union, asks Andrea Leadsom.

There would be advantages in terms of a newly established single supervisory mechanism. [But] the single supervisory mechanism of the ECB also relies on national supervisors for smaller local firms so there would need to be some capacity built up there.

It has the advantage of having a single resolution mechanism which solves one of the issues.

It does not have the advantage of common deposit guarantee scheme which would need to be built up.

Still to be determined would be the lender of last resort arrangements.

And asked whether a currency union with the EU would be viable, Carney says any currency union is "a bit like being pregnant" in that you can't be somewhat viable, you either are or you are not.

Does it make it more viable? There's a wide range of factors which would determine viability. Viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant. You can't be half viable in a currency union. You need all the components of a currency union. You have to look at the whole package.

12.09 He's also said Scotland would need to hold higher currency reserves if a sterling union was perceived as temporary.





12.03 Carney says it would be a "distinct possibility" that RBS would have to move its headquarters to England if Scotland becomes independent but remains part of the EU.

12.02 Would Scottish banks need to change their domicile to continue to be regulated by the London regulators, asks David Ruffley.

The key question is that it is not clear in the European context that the domicile of the major banks in Scotland would remain in Scotland given the location of head office like activities in the rest of the UK. It's not an issue at the moment. There are considerable value added head office activities in Scotland for those banks but a determination would have to be made.

Ruffley asks whether the PRA would require Scottish banks to bring their headquarters to England should Scotland become independent. Carney says:

If Scotland were not a member of the EEA that is a decision the PRA would have to consider very carefully.

11.57 He adds that an independent Scotland would need to guarantee Scottish-domiciled banks' English deposits under EU law.

11.56 Carney says the Bank would have to evaluate the suitability of Scotland's financial institutions for the continued access to the Bank of England's services.

How we do that evaluation depends on whether an independent Scotland was a member of the EU or EEA. If it were, there are passporting rights. If not we have to make an individual assessment of solvency and viability of those institutions. That deterination would be influenced by the credibility of the monetary arrangements.

11.50 Nor has the Financial Policy Committee discussed Scottish independence.

It is in part a product of the assessment of risk we have to prioritise. The arrangements, if this were to come to pass, there is a period of time over which arrangements would be developed.

The second point is that there is a referendum in September there is a clear view of all the parties in Westminster on the arrangements after that referendum which colours the prob of the types of financial stability risk that we could face.

If the circumstances were to come to pass that there were a prospect to the change of monetary arrangements in the UK that fell to the wrong side of the risks outlined in my speech, we would provide clear and public advice on those.

11.45 The Bank has not considered whether the composition of the MPC would change if Scotland were to enter into a currency union as this is a question of governance, so the responsibility of the Government.

11.43 Carney says Scotland's economy is more volatile due to its industrial structure, but is reluctant to predict whether it would be more or less volatile on its own.

There are a variety of issues around an informal adoption of sterling, not least the absence of formal lender of last resort abilities, deposit guarantee systems.

11.41 Do economies need to be well correlated for currency unions to work, asks Hosie. Here's Carney:

It's beneficial to the suitability of monetary policy of constituent members of currency unions. It's more difficult if policy is tight because of weight of activity in one part of the union versus another.

The economies are highly correlated. The counterfactual question is: To what extent could that change should there be a change in the arrangements between Scotland and the rest of the UK?

11.36 Stuart Hosie wonders how members of a currency union can ensure price and financial stability. Carney says the essential elements are:

- free movement of labour, goods and capital, adding that any element that detracts from those movements could lead to some misalignment in terms of economic cycles

- there needs to be currency arrangements with smooth fluctuation in some parts of the union. "Looking at federations, that central fiscal arrangement tends to be in the order of 25pc of GDP which provides some stabilisers".

- there can be disparity between members, but not too much.

11.30 We're back in business. Now Carney is being asked about the economics of currency unions with a view to the possibility of an independent Scotland forming one with the rest of the UK.

Carney grilled on inflation report

11.22 That ties up the inflation report section of today's session. The Committee is taking a five minute break. Next up, Carney will be flying solo, and facing questions on the "economics of currency unions".

11.20 David Miles has called an end to below-inflation wage rises. He says we're getting to the point where wage growth will start outstripping inflation, although he adds that while he is optimistic about growth, that he is less optimistic about making up for all the lost ground of the last few years.

11.15 After a fairly unexciting start to trading, the FTSE 100 has slipped lower and is down 19 points, or 0.3pc, at 6,670 in mid-morning dealings. Worries about the Ukraine crisis and poor Chinese exports data hit the market yesterday. David Madden, market analyst at spread-better IG, reckons both factors are continuing to weigh on sentiment:

Stocks have gotten off to a shaky start this morning as the mining sector is still fragile after the slump yesterday on the back of Chinese trade figures. The Asian powerhouse is depending too heavily on credit for it's growth, but who will fill the gap when their appetite for metals falls?

Traders are reluctant to go long on banks as they play wait-and-see for the Crimea crisis to play out; the possibility of a war is forcing dealers to remain on the sidelines.

11.08 Miles Fisher has admitted that recordings of the Bank of England MPC meetings are not kept - that the minutes are the only version of meetings kept for posterity. He says there were efforts do do so initially but that the "free flowing discussion" meant "it was very hard to transcribe the tapes in a way that made any sense in terms of written material".

He says he thinks it would "change the nature of the debate if people had an eye on the fact they were being recorded for posterity" and that he wanted to ensure that the committee meetings had a "genuine free flowing expression of ideas".

Tyrie asks Carney to revisit this issue and see if he can find a way to keep recordings of committee meetings.

<noframe>Twitter: Hugh Pym - Andrew Tyrie argues best for historians if recordings of MPC meetings are retained - asks Governor to consider transcripts of meetings</noframe>

11.05 George Mudie is digging into the early history of QE, asking the MPC members to confirm that it was pushed on the governor by the then-Chancellor Gordon Brown.

Miles Fisher says the Bank's asset purchases took two forms. The decision to monthly asset purchases for monetary policy purposes in March 2009 was taken by the MPC, with permission from the Government. He says that prior to this the Treasury asked the Bank ot undertake asset purchases but not for monetary policy purposes.

<noframe>Twitter: James Kirkup - Carney: There is no danger of my vote or anyone else&rsquo;s on the committee being influenced by the political timetable.</noframe>

10.53 David Miles says SME lending "slowly has improved". He says he has "detected more optimism among SMEs" in the last six to 12 months among SEMs, even though loan availability has "lagged behind the major improvement" for larger companies.

10.47 David Ruffley wonders what will most help solve the productivity puzzle.

Carney says it will be a mix of a "better functioning financial system, leading to better reallocation and getting births and deaths back up", a process of "learning by doing which comes as a consequence of rapid growth" and a "sharp pick up in investment over the forecast period".

10.39 John Mann wants to know whether Carney meant that labour in the North will undergo more recycling than that in the South.

The basic point I was making is we have seen less adjustment than we have seen historically in terms of new company formation and old company exit. That process adds to productivity and that adds to real wages.

10.38 David Miles says the "safe real interset rate" in the world has been steadily declining in recent years, and declined even more in the years after the financial crisis.

That's partly a reflection that people think the economy is a more risky place and they are willing to accept a lower rate on interst on safe assets.

10.30 Carney in a case of stating the obvious: "The Bank of England needs to get better at forecasting."

10.27 Tyrie asks Carney why he has said QE should not happen until interest rates start rising. Carney goes even further, saying unwinding QE should come after "several" rounds of interest rate rises. This is because, he says, it would be best to avoid a situation where the Bank would have to restart asset purchases.

10.26 Back in the FTSE 100, Sports Direct, up 2.5pc, is the biggest riser in the index, buoyed by the performance targets the company has set out in its executive bonus share scheme. Following Sports Direct's proposal to partner with Debenhams, there has been speculation the sports retailer might attempt a takeover of the department store group. Analysts at Espirito Santo today said:

What do the new debt and EBITDA targets imply re Debenhams and Sports Direct's (SPD) capacity to take it out? We only mention this as the market is bound to consider it. Debenhams has a current market cap of £970m, consensus EBITDA at Aug 14 of £230m and forecast net debt at that time of around £400m – so a current enterprise value of £1.4bn. Combined pro-forma EBITDA of £630m would allow net debt at 1.5x to reach £950m. So SPD would not be able to buy Debenhams for cash and stay within the debt target. This is all our estimation as SPD has not given any clue as to its intentions. So we think today’s news should be good for SPD (FY 15E EBITDA target 7-8pc ahead of consensus) and a negative for Debenhams.

10.24 An interesting line of questioning from Tyrie. "Is QE monetary policy?" "Is it the preserve of the MPC?" Carney answers yes to both.

My view is that the unwinding of QE is a monetary policy decision.

I think we should consult with the debt management office but with respect to the Treasury it's clearly an MPC decision.

10.19 Carney has also conceded that the Bank will not sell off all the £375bn of QE "as some will mature before the sale". He's also said that the Bank is "moving back" to the day when it will no longer need to provide forward guidance.

10.16 And the MPC's David Miles has admitted he has no special insight into the Bank's distinction between the 'output gap' and 'slack in the economy'.

<noframe>Twitter: Chris Giles - Hooray, David Miles says he is confused about the distinction made between slack and the output gap. Aren't we all</noframe>

10.12 Returning to the Treasury Select Committee, Carney has admitted that he was overruled by the MPC on publishing the output gap.

<noframe>Twitter: Philip Aldrick - Carney reveals he has been overruled on the MPC. 'I think we shd publish the output gap but I'm not in the majority on the cttee' he says</noframe>

BREAKING: Bob Crow, leader of the RMT union, has died

10.10 We're getting reports that union leader Bob Crow has died. He was 52.

10.08 Carney admits that the Bank's surveys have found that forward guidance was "much better understood" by businesses than by households.

10.05 He says the introduction of 18 economic indicators in the February inflation report was a result of the Stockton review's recommendations to improve Bank transparency. He also says that Charlie Bean's estimate that interest rates could reach 2 to 2.5pc over the next three years is "not unreasonable".



10.03 Carney says he has "absolutely no regrets" about putting in forward guidance:

In terms of the first phase of guidance we focussed on unemployment. That was a relatively easy call because it was the most readily identifiable, easily understood indicator of spare capacity in economy.

Thee key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time.

I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target.

<noframe>Twitter: Louise Armitstead - Carney under attack from MPs for switching explicit forward guidance for "18 new goal posts" and "fuzzy guidance."</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Louise Armitstead - Carney defends Fwd guidance: "I have absolutely no regrets that we&rsquo;re sitting here in March with half a million more people in work."</noframe>

09.51 Carney says that the pressure that rising interest rates will put on shaky businesses is no bad thing for the economy.mortgage costs will increase just using market interest rates

[With low interest rates, there have been] fewer births and deaths of companies and as a consequence less recycling of capital and labour and oopportunity. It's hard to quantify this but we think that's one of the causes of the weak productivity performance.

It's a necessary part of the adjustment in the economy. It is a factor which influences the pace and level of adjustment of interest rates.

09.48 Carney says the Bank's Financial Policy Committee is looking to introduce a mortgage affordability test that works in the potential for mortgage rates to rise nearer normal levels over the course of the mortgage.

09.40 Carney says the Bank does not have the tools that can directly affect the cash buyers' market in prime London property. Asked whether he is concerned that fast rising prices in London could spread to the rest of the country he said:

We have to be alive to that possibility. Our concerns centre around udnerwriting standards at present are quite high, vastly improved relative to pre crisis levels. Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen.

Rising housing market in part because of dynamics in prime central london would encourage individuals to take greater risk without fully incorporating interest rate cycles that would transpire over the life of a mortgage.

What we are doing as the FPC is to look into [how many people would lose their houses if interest rates rise]. Not just aggregate numbers, but to using survey data and ultimately using loan level data to look at most vulnerable borrowers and how those dynamics move. Those are some of the early warning signs in terms of potential vulnerablilites in the housing market.

09.36 Martin Weale says the output gap is probably lower than what unemployment figures imply. He says that newly employed people, who account for the fall in unemployment, are typically paid 60pc of average pay since they tend to be young and because a spell of unemployment tends to carry a pay penalty. So if we're measuring output with wages, then we' might get a falsely low picture.

<noframe>Twitter: Sarah O'Connor - Weale thinks there is "something under one per cent" of spare capacity in the economy. Lot less than Carney <a href="http://t.co/uWUwdP3gLh" target="_blank">http://t.co/uWUwdP3gLh</a></noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Megan Murphy - Martin Weale really didn't like forward guidance. "Had I thought there was a significant risk that unemployment would fall... (1/2)"</noframe>

09.35 He says he believes there is spare capacity in firms as well as the labour market but that the board differs in its views on this point.

09.33 The Treasury Select Committee has kicked off.

He starts by saying he thinks the output gap is "even higher" than 1.5pc - the estimate that the Bank gave in its February inflation report and that the equilibrium level of UK unemployment is "slightly lower than 6pc".

<noframe>Twitter: Ed Conway - Carney says his personal estimate of the output gap is at the "upper range" of the Bank's 1-1.5% estimate. Eg more room for economic bounce</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Faisal Islam - Carney personally thinks that the medium term equilibrium level of UK unemployment is "slightly lower than 6"...</noframe>

Industrial production disappoints

09.31 Industrial production rose 0.1pc in January, bringing the year-on-year increase to 3pc. That compared with predictions of a 0.2pc and 3pc rise respectively.

Sutherland hands in resignation: more details

09.26 James Quinn has more details on Sutherland's resignation letter.

His resignation has not yet been accepted, but sources indicated it is hard to see him staying with the Co-op.

In his letter, he told Ms Lidbetter that the mutual is "ungovernable" and that there appear to be people within the organisation who do not want his reforms to succeed.

His resignation follows news at the weekend that he was on course to make £3.66m as part of a proposed compensation package.

The Telegraph has learned that Mr Sutherland's resignation was discussed during an emergency board meeting on Monday evening, held by telephone.

No final decision was made as to whether to accept his resignation, with further discussions set to continue this morning.

It was unclear whether Mr Sutherland was at work at the Co-op's Manchester head office this morning.

On the board call, the directors agreed to put a series of proposals on corporate governance to the annual general meeting in May.

FTSE starts the day with a whimper

09.06 It's a fairly uneventful start to the day for the FTSE 100, which has drifted 3 points lower to 6,685 in early trade. Engine-maker Rolls-Royce, up 1.9pc, is the biggest riser in the benchmark index for a second day running, in the wake of its deal to take full control of its power systems joint venture from Daimler.

Coming up today....

09.00 Here's what we'll be following today:

At 09.30 Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England will face a barrage of questions on everything from February's inflation report to the Bank's knowledge of alleged forex rigging, to Scottish independence. It might be a long morning for the guv.

Also at 09.30 we'll hear how Britain's heavy industries fared in January. Economists expect output from industrial production - which includes mining, energy and manufacturing - to have grown 0.2pc.

At 10.15 Executive from Primark, Tesco and Sainsbury's will explain to MPs working on the Draft Modern Slavery Bill how their supply chains are free from slavery.

Then at 15.00 The National Institute of Economic and Social Research is putting out its GDP estimate for February.

In Brussels, George Osborne is joining the 27 other EU finance ministers for their regular Ecofin meeting - progress with an EU banking union is likely to dominate.

Corporate news round-up

08.42 Louise Armitstead has taken a look at this morning's company announcements in the City Briefing email (sign up here).

John Allan, chairman of Dixons Retail, has been hired to be the next chairman of Barratt Development. Mr Allan, the former chief executive of Excel who's also a director of Royal Mail, will join Barratt's board immediately and take over from Bob Lawson in November.

Inchcape has reported a 7.7pc rise in annual sales and a 7.4pc jump in pre-tax profits, driving its fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings. The car dealership, sells Mercedes Benz, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover in 25 countries, has described the results as "premium returns" although the figures are not quite as good as the market was expecting. Investors will be looking for an update on sales in to Russia.

Foxtons Group has reported a 16pc jump in annual revenues to £139.2m and a 56.6pc rise in pre-tax profits to £38.9m in its first full year results since listing in September last year. The estate agent has ridden the housing boom reporting a 22.5pc jump in sales volumes and a 6.7pc rise in lettings.

There are results from Esure and Antofagasta too.

Heathrow has reported a 1pc rise in passenger figures in February to 4.9m. BRIC passenger rose 2.5pc, with a 14.8pc jump in the number of people traveling from China. Reed Elsevier has published its annual report. Later Flybe shareholders will today vote on the proposed £150m placing.

Foxtons has posted a 56.6pc rise in pre-tax profits to £38.9m

Meg Hillier: Sutherland is 'jumping the gun'

08.34 Meg Hillier, Labour and Co-op MP, has criticised Euan Sutherland for 'jumping the gun' and points out that if he is embarrassed that his pay package was leaked then he does not have to accept it. Speaking on Radio Four, she said:

It seems to me that Euan Sutherland, he's got a timetable of things that have to be done but he's jumping the gun and compeltely ignoring the mutual ethos of the Co-operative Group and that is a bank that's owned by its members and that for me is a fundamental part of what the Co-operative Group is about and you can't have it both ways.

Strong leadership in a mutual model does not mean throwing a fit and throwing the toys out of the pram when something like your salary is leaked.

He needs to realise he's swimming in different waters from the PLC banking world and if he didn't want to take that on then he shouldn't have. We want him to sort out the group but to threaten to resign like this I find deeply unhelpful. It threatens the group more.

Mike Ashley in line for £65m pay scheme

08.24 Sports Direct has called an shareholder meeting for April 4 to approve a pay scheme that would award Mike Ashley, its majority shareholder, 8m in stock, worth almost £65m.

The sports retailer was forced to withdraw a similar scheme from annual meeting last September in the face of an investor revolt, led by the ABI and PIRC. In a statement today, Sports Direct has repeated its concern that Ashley, who owns a 71pc stake and is also the owner of Newcastle United, has not been paid since the company's listing in 2007, despite its market value soaring from £2bn to £5bn. "The board believes that Mike Ashley is central to this value creation," the company has said. The company says it has already secured the support of Odey Asset Management, the hedge fund run by Crispin Odey, but it ought to be braced for a tough match with others nonetheless.

Sutherland: Co-op Group is 'ungovernable'

08.02 More on that story. The BBC reports that in a resignation letter, Mr Sutherland said he believed the group was "ungovernable". It reports that the letter is understood to be a "back me or sack me move".

The letter comes hot on the heels of a row over Mr Sutherland's £3.6m pay package, leaked to the Observer newspaper on Sunday. The Co-op Group has defended its boss's remuneration - almost treble that paid to his predecessor - saying it was necessary as the group sought to recover from the biggest crisis in its 150 year history.

Co-op chief executive has 'written a resignation letter'

07.52 Breaking on the BBC is news that Euan Sutherland, chief executive of the embattled Co-op Group, has written a resignation letter. We'll follow developments as the story unfolds.

(NYSE: MCD) U.S. stores fell and the company’s global sales were rescued by sales in Europe. U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, while sales in Europe rose 0.6% and sales in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) fell 2.6%. Overall global same-store sales were down 0.3% in February, compared with sales in February 2013.

That is much worse than the January performance, where global same-store sales were up 1.2%, even though U.S. sales were down 3.3%. Europe and APMEA both grew sales in January by 2% and 5.4%, respectively, to offset the big decline in the United States.

U.S. sales were down due to “challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.” APMEA sales fell as a result of weaker sales in Japan, the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday and negative performance in Australia. The United Kingdom and France offset weaker sales in Germany to post a slight gain in European sales.

The company’s CFO noted that year-to-date performance “will pressure margins in the first quarter.” That is not good news for shareholders.

What is even worse news is that the company’s priorities do not appear to be having a significant positive impact on sales. In the fourth quarter of 2013, same-store sales fell 0.1% and consolidated net income was flat. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% while rising 1% in Europe and falling by 2.4% in Asia. That is just about where the stores are at the end of February, and that is why the CFO is hinting that profits appear to be headed to finish no better than flat in the first quarter of this year.

See up-to-the-moment rankings for the best and worst performers in GDP, unemployment rate, inflation and much more.###3253||The Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers (Nasdaq: JOSB) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Men's Wearhouse will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Jos. A. Bank for $65.00 per share in cash, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction.

Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., with approximately 23,000 employees and sales of $3.5 billion on a pro forma basis.

"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers," said Doug Ewert, President and Chief Executive Officer of Men's Wearhouse. "Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach. We expect the transaction will be accretive to Men's Wearhouse's earnings in the first full year."

Mr. Ewert continued, "The combined company will have the operational flexibility to successfully execute on strategic plans at both brands. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents and are confident that our combined best-in-class offerings for our valued customers will drive significant shareholder value. All of us at Men's Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees. I am confident that, together, we will create a truly great company for all of our stakeholders."

Robert N. Wildrick, Chairman of the Board of Jos. A. Bank, said, "Our Board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value creation. We have been committed to pursuing a range of strategic alternatives to achieve that goal. The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men's Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings. On behalf of our Board and management team, I would like to express our deep appreciation to our employees for their hard work in making Jos. A. Bank the great company it is today. We look forward to working together with Men's Wearhouse to ensure a smooth transition."

Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Combination

o Provides compelling value for both companies' shareholders: The combination provides Jos. A. Bank's shareholders immediate liquidity and substantial value for their investment. The transaction represents a 65% premium over Jos. A. Bank's unaffected enterprise value and a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank's closing share price on October 8, 2013, the day prior to the public announcement of Jos. A. Bank's proposal to acquire Men's Wearhouse. Further, the transaction represents a 10x enterprise value to last twelve months ("LTM") Adjusted EBITDA[1] multiple (assuming an estimated $137 million of Adjusted EBITDA for Jos. A. Bank's fiscal 2013 ending February 1, 2014).[2]

Men's Wearhouse shareholders will benefit from approximately $100 to $150 million of run-rate annual synergies realized over three years, through improving purchasing efficiencies, optimizing customer service and marketing practices, and streamlining duplicative corporate functions. Additionally, Men's Wearhouse's vertical direct sourcing model will be leveraged to improve combined merchandising and sourcing across the combined company and rationalize inventory over time.

o Combined company positioned to succeed: The combined company will be the fourth largest U.S. men's apparel retailer with pro forma sales of approximately $3.5 billion. This transaction brings together a high-value collection of national and owned brands. Building on the two companies' complementary business models, the combined company will better serve an expanded customer base in more locations and optimize merchandising and sourcing capabilities.

o Smooth transition expected: Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank expect a smooth integration, as there will be no rebranding or remodels required – Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place. In addition, the Men's Wearhouse management team has a proven track record of successful acquisitions, having integrated approximately 600 stores and over 7,000 employees in connection with its previous acquisitions of Joseph Abboud, After Hours and Moores. Men's Wearhouse expects to implement the best practices of both companies to drive further operational and financial success. Management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations.

Terms of the Transaction

Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for approximately $1.8 billion in cash. Today, Men's Wearhouse announced that it has extended the expiration date of its tender offer to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, March 19, 2014, unless extended. Men's Wearhouse will amend its pending tender offer prior to that expiration date in accordance with, and to reflect, the terms of the Merger Agreement, including to reflect the increase in the purchase price to be offered to $65.00 per share and other changes contemplated by the Merger Agreement between Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank.

Jos. A. Bank's Board of Directors unanimously determined that the definitive merger agreement with Men's Wearhouse and the terms of the Men's Wearhouse tender offer are fair to and in the best interests of Jos. A. Bank and its shareholders, and recommends that Jos. A. Bank shareholders tender their Jos. A. Bank shares to Men's Wearhouse. Jos. A. Bank will amend its Schedule 14D-9 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the recommendation of its Board of Directors. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the valid tender of sufficient shares, which, when added to shares owned by Men's Wearhouse and its affiliates, constitute a majority of the total number of common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Any shares not tendered in the offer will be acquired in a second step merger at the same cash price as in the tender offer.

In conjunction with this transaction, Jos. A. Bank has terminated its agreement to acquire Everest Holdings LLC, the parent company of Eddie Bauer. As a result of the termination of its agreement to purchase Everest Holdings LLC, the terms and conditions of the offer were not satisfied. Effective immediately, Jos. A. Bank is also withdrawing its previously announced tender offer to purchase for cash up to $300 million in value of its common stock.

Financing and Approvals

The Men's Wearhouse tender offer is not conditioned on financing, and the Company expects to finance the transaction with a combination of balance sheet cash and committed debt financing from BofA Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The strong free cash flow generated by the combined company is expected to enable rapid deleveraging.

The transaction, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2014, is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. Both Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank are working cooperatively with the Federal Trade Commission to obtain approval of the transaction as soon as possible.

Advisors

BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are serving as financial advisors to Men's Wearhouse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is serving as legal advisor.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Financo, LLC are serving as financial advisors to Jos. A. Bank, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Guilfoil Petzall & Shoemake, L.L.C. are serving as its legal advisors.###3254||Alibaba is set to undertake an initial public offering (IPO) in the US, the Chinese e-commerce giant confirmed on Sunday.

The move has been touted by analysts as the biggest potential IPO since >Facebook went public in 2012. Reports on Friday suggested the Hangzhou-based Internet giant had opted for the New York Stock Exchange after ruling out Hong Kong and London.

Alibaba owns two of China’s most popular online shopping services – Taobao and TMall – with a total transaction value of $163 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, according to Xinhua news agency.

In a brief statement on its corporate news Web site, Alibaba said it also might consider extending its public status to Chinese capital markets in the future to allow local investors to share in its growth.

The IPO would “make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals,” the statement said.

Estimates of the likely valuation have ranged from $55 billion to $120 billion.

Alibaba employs more than 20,000 people around the world and has more than 70 offices in China, Singapore, India, Britain and the US.

Taobao has more than 90 per cent of the China online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions with more than 500 million users, the South China Morning Post reported.###3255||Empty###3256||Empty###3257||Creates Leading Men’s Apparel Retailer with Enhanced Scale and a Broadened Customer Reach Expects $100-$150 Million of Run-Rate Annual Synergies Men’s Wearhouse Looks Forward to Working with Strong Jos.

The Fed has said in its recent policy statements it won’t start raising short-term interest rates from near zero until well past the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. That position hasn’t changed. But with joblessness at 6.7% in February, several officials have indicated in recent speeches and interviews they might want to scrap the threshold entirely or revamp their message in other ways.

Fed policy makers will debate the matter at their meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, though reaching agreement on a new approach could be a challenge.

The options some officials have mentioned include offering broad assurances, not a numerical threshold, for considering when to raise rates; citing a wider array of measures to consider when assessing when to raise rates; and providing more information about how much they would raise rates after they start the process.

“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6 1/2 % threshold because it’s not really providing any great value,” New York Fed President William Dudley said in an interview earlier this month. The 6.5% threshold is “a little bit obsolete.”

Most outlets jumped on the news without bothering to confirm the memo was real.

DAMO-AV

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

2 August 2017

SUBJECT: Discontinue Use of Dajiang Innovation (DJI) Corporation Unmanned Aircraft Systems

1. References:

a. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) report, “DJI UAS Technology Threat and User Vulnerabilities,” dated 25 May 2017 (Classified).

b. Navy memorandum, “Operational Risks with Regards to DJI Family of Products,” dated 24 May 2017.

2. Background: DJI Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) products are the most widely used non-program of record commercial off-the-shelf UAS employed by the Army. The Army Aviation Engineering Directorate has issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets. Due to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products, it is directed that the U.S. Army halt the use of all DJI products. This guidance applies to all DJI UAS and any system that employs DJI electrical components or software including, but not limited to, flight computers, cameras, radios, batteries, speed controllers, GPS units, handheld control stations, or devices with DJI software applications installed.

3. Direction: Cease all use, uninstall all DJI applications, remove all batteries/storage media from devices, and secure equipment for follow on direction.

4. Point of Contact: Headquarters, Department of the Army G-3/5/7 Aviation Directorate, 703-693-3552

JOSEPH ANDERSON

Lieutenant General, GS

Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7

All it took was a quick phone call to the Pentagon, and the rampant speculation falls apart into a CYA statement by an Army spokesperson:

We can confirm that guidance was issued; however, we are currently reviewing the guidance and cannot comment further at this time.

If you’re wondering what the hell that even says, it’s a basic the left hand didn’t know what the right hand was doing.

DJI’s Adam Lisberg on today’s events was the company was just as confused as the rest of us.

People, businesses, and governments around the world rely on DJI’s products and technology for a variety of uses including sensitive and mission critical operations. The Department of the Army memo even reports that they have “issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets.”

We are surprised and disappointed to read reports of the U.S. Army’s unprompted restriction on DJI drones as we were not consulted during their decision. We are happy to work directly with any organization, including the U.S. Army, which has concerns about our management of cyber issues.

We’ll be reaching out to the U.S. Army to confirm the memo and to understand what is specifically meant by ‘cyber vulnerabilities.’

Until then, we ask everyone to refrain from undue speculation.

Yeah, it’s the Internet. Refrain from speculation? Say what?

Two paths here. The first is say there is a vulnerability of the DJI equipment. It would be a DOD-wide directive from the office of the Secretary of Defense, not the US Army.

The second path is this memo was written and accidentally released. It was never meant for public consumption. The Pentagon and DJI would work together to harden the systems for any classified or mission critical missions the products would be involved in.

It’s another lesson of asking basic questions. Don’t accept something as fact when a simple two-minute phone call gets you a confirmation and a whole lot of CYA. You can literally google the US Army’s Pentagon Public Affairs Office. Adding ‘Reportedly’ to headlines should not release outlets from basic reporting. If a two-man operation in Alabama can get answers, why can’t a VC-backed outlet get the same info?

We will update this article as more information becomes available.###3262||Empty###3263||U.S. stocks closed mixed today, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average incurring losses, while the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq noted modest gains.

WARSAW, March 10 — Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned today amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine.

“Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt,” Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to the east.

Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.

“The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union,” Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the NATO defence alliance.

The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Merkel's Wednesday visit.

“I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole,” he said.

“I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money,” Tusk said.

“This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon,” he added.

Tusk said talks with Merkel would also focus on “how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance”.

Washington on Friday played down the risk posed to the European economy by Russia's threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, insisting the region had adequate stocks.

Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev. — AFP###3266||It may be a coincidence that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable is occurring during the lead-up to a midterm election season where candidates from both parties need cash to hold on to their seats in the Congress and Senate, but that very need for funds is giving the Kabletown Krew a good opportunity to grease the wheels on Capitol Hill.

Politico reports that, through varied means, Comcast has to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which will likely have a hand in helping regulators determine whether or not the merger gets approved.

Additionally, 15 of the 18 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have received help from the Comcast coffers, including Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, Texas’s Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Two House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee may not end up being directly involved in the merger approval process, but they do have some oversight over Comcast and the cable/Internet industry in general. Thus, reports Politico, members of those committees are awash in Comcash, with 50 of the 54 members of the House committee receiving money from the company, and 20 of 24 Senate members feeding from the Comcast trough.

Comcast says that critics are misinterpreting their donations.

“Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,” a company mouthpiece tells Politico. “It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers.”

And just think about it — if the deal goes through, Comcast will control an even larger customer base, meaning that more Senators and Congresspersons will “represent” Comcast customers, and thus need to be paid in kind.###3267||Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus thinks the $45.2 billion megamerger with Comcast is a win for Time Warner Cable subscribers.

Speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this week, Marcus called the deal a "dream combination" that allows the companies to "innovate at a rapid pace."

I know what you're thinking: Of course he likes this deal. His company is getting bought out for $45.2 billion. And Marcus, who is paid in excess of $10 million a year, is the guy who spearheaded this tie-up in the first place. And there's little doubt he will profit handsomely from the acquisition.

But hear me out. He might actually be right.

As a Time Warner Cable customer for more than 15 years, I can attest that the service I've been getting for nearly two decades is nothing to write home about. And the bottom line is that the services that Comcast offers its customers today is simply better than what's available to Time Warner Cable consumers.

"Comcast is more innovative than any other operator when it comes to video service," said Erik Brannon, senior analyst for US Television at IHS. "By contrast Time Warner Cable has been less interested in things like converting analog subscribers to digital subscribers. And the implication is that on the whole their network is not quite as robust as Comcast's."

Even though Comcast hasn't made any promises about when or where Time Warner Cable customers will get Comcast's suite of services, it's clear these offerings will eventually make it to Time Warner Cable territory. And that could be a very good thing for Time Warner customers in spite of concerns that the cable giant is getting even larger.

"Some features and services people can expect relatively quickly after the merger," said Marcien Jenckes, executive vice president of consumer services for Comcast. "Today we're the leaders in terms of broadband speeds, TV content catalog and experience, as well as TV Everywhere. And Time Warner Cable customers can expect all of this over time."

It's hard not to be skeptical

I realize many consumers are skeptical of big mergers such as this one. And this particular merger is as big as they get. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators in the country. The combined company would control 33 million broadband connections. Together the companies will be in 19 of the 20 largest metro markets in the country. So it's easy to see why people are concerned and even skeptical of a deal that concentrates so much power in the hands of one company.

Comcast

Add on top of that, the fact that rates on expanded basic cable TV service have increased by more than 20 percent in recent years, it's hard to imagine that a merger of this proportion could be positive for consumers. Don't forget, Philadelphia-based Comcast and New York-based Time Warner Cable consistently rank at the bottom of most customer satisfaction surveys.

What many consumer advocates and lawmakers such as Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) surmise is that this must mean bad news for consumers.

"I think consumers will end up paying more," Franken said Monday on the "CBS This Morning" show, according to Variety. "There will be less competition; there will be less innovation and, worse, even worse service."

These are indeed legitimate fears. It's difficult to imagine that a merger of this size would actually lead to better customer service and satisfaction. I also am not so bold as to predict that prices might actually go down for former Time Warner Cable customers. In fact, Comcast's own David Cohen has admitted he can't make that assurance either: "We're certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly."

Still, the reality is that when you really look at Comcast's network and services, and even its pricing, compared to Time Warner Cable's services, an argument can be made that Time Warner Cable customers may have a lot to gain from being converted to Comcast customers.

"For all the complaints about how expensive cable TV is, Comcast has traditionally offered its customers the best bang for the buck in the industry," said Craig Moffett, an equities analyst with MoffettNathanson.

More value for your money, especially in video

When it comes to video service, there's no question that Comcast has a better offering compared with what Time Warner Cable offers today. From its video-on-demand catalog to its TV Everywhere service to a cloud-based user interface it's been developing the past couple of years, Comcast has invested heavily in revamping its TV service, and it shows.

"Comcast has really focused on investing in its network," IHS analyst Brannon said. "Time Warner Cable has been reacting to changes in the market too, but not with the same speed or veracity that Comcast has. And they've suffered as a consequence."

Specifically, Time Warner Cable has been less interested and less willing to spend money to upgrade its network to digital transmission. The result has been that Time Warner Cable offers fewer high-definition on-demand streams and its TV Everywhere product, which allows people to view TV on mobile devices anywhere, has been limited in terms of available programming.

Meanwhile, Comcast offers more video-on-demand content than any other paid TV provider in the country. This includes a library of movies and TV shows that totals more than 50,000 titles that are free or can be rented for a fee.

Additionally, Comcast is the leader in TV Everywhere. Through its Xfinity TV Go app, viewers can watch 35 live TV channels on their tablets or smartphones. This compares with a mere 12 TV Everywhere channels available from Time Warner. Comcast customers also get access to more than 25,000 on-demand shows and videos through the app.

And Comcast is constantly in search of new content to add to its portfolio. It recently announced it has struck deals with Sony Pictures and Lions Gate to start offering "House of Cards" and "Orange Is the New Black" to its lineup of on-demand content. Up until these deals, these two TV series were exclusive to Netflix subscribers.

But Comcast hasn't stopped there. It also has revamped its user interface and program guide based on a new cloud architecture it calls X1. Not only are the program guide and user interface much more interactive, which allows for more personalization, but the X1 platform allows subscribers to access TV shows and movies in new ways.

Comcast

For example, Comcast subscribers can view all live TV and recorded DVR shows on their mobile devices while in the home via the X1 platform. And they can even download recorded content from their DVR on their mobile devices for viewing outside the home. Comcast is testing the service right now in Boston and hopes to have it rolled out to the rest of its territory later this year.

"When we ask people to pay $70 a month, we want to make sure we're delivering a value," Comcast's Jenckes said. "In fact, our job is to deliver the best price value to our subscribers. And we are achieving that in ways that no one else in the industry can match."

Shooting itself in the foot

A lack of technology investment isn't the only reason why Time Warner Cable's service trails behind Comcast's. The company also has a history of contentious negotiations with programmers over digital video rights. As a result, the company has not been able to add as many channels to its TV Everywhere service or as many titles to its VOD service as Comcast. But there have been other consequences as well. A dispute this past summer over retransmission fees with broadcaster CBS led to a weeks-long black-out of CBS programming for Time Warner Cable customers. (CBS is the parent company of CNET.) Some 300,000 Time Warner Cable TV subscribers left over the debacle.

"The general feeling in the industry is that Time Warner Cable has been more resistant in terms of fee increases for content," Brannon said. "This reluctance has put them behind others in terms of their TV Everywhere offering."

Brannon added that companies, such as Comcast, which have been more willing to negotiate terms with content owners, have a broader TV Everywhere portfolio.

"TV Everywhere is an essential feature in all video carriage negotiations these days," he said. "There is an inherent trade-off between features versus cost, but all cable video services are under pressure to get these deals done."

Better broadband

Video isn't the only area in which Time Warner Cable customers can expect to see improvements. Comcast also has been a leader among cable operators in driving higher broadband speeds. It was one of the first cable operators to deploy Docsis 3.0 technology standards, which offer more capacity on broadband networks.

While Google has made a splash over the past year with its 1Gbps high-speed Internet service in Kansas City and is now expanding to additional markets, Comcast was the first cable operator to demonstrate a 1Gbps speed download over a traditional HFC, or hybrid fiber-coaxial, network. And at last year's National Cable and Telecommunications conference, the company showed off a 3Gbps download.

Today, the fastest broadband service Comcast offers widely is 105Mbps, which is about double the speed that Time Warner is offering in most of its market. That said, Time Warner is offering a 100Mbps service in Kansas City, where not-so-coincidentally Google has deployed its 1Gpbs service. Time Warner Cable also will offer 100Mbps service in Austin, Texas, where AT&T and Google have each pledged to build 1Gbps fiber networks.

Of course, some people have questioned why Comcast, which has shown off technology for achieving gigabit-speed broadband, hasn't offered such speeds itself. It's a valid question that I've asked myself. The company claims there isn't enough consumer demand. And indeed at the high prices Comcast and other cable operators are likely to charge for these super high-speed connections, that is likely the case.

But given the fact that Time Warner Cable has never been considered a leader in terms of broadband speeds, it's hard to argue that through its merger with Comcast, the market would be losing a competitive force that is driving the industry toward higher-speed connections.

Rather, I would argue that the telephone companies -- AT&T and Verizon Communications -- and to a much lesser extent, Google, are providing more incentive to all cable operators to increase their network speeds. Comcast actually faces less competition in its markets from Google and the phone companies than Time Warner Cable, and the increased exposure to this threat could spur faster improvement in the network.

"AT&T and Verizon are exerting tremendous pressure on the cable operators," Brannon said. "In many ways their technology is superior to the cable operators'."

If there is a downside to the deal for consumers, it's that one company would have unprecedented control over which cable channels can and can't be seen by millions of Americans, and even whether some independent programmers would be economically viable, Moffett said. This argument comes down to the fact that since Comcast will be controlling so many of the nation's TV subscribers and because it already controls a lot of the cable content via its acquisition of NBC Universal, the company will have much more negotiating power and in some cases control over programmers.

During his interview at the Deutsche Bank conference, Marcus laughed off the idea that a combined company with greater purchasing power would cause programmers to suffer.

"I just find these types of concerns ironic, especially when programming costs in recent years have risen to a level that is greater than what the consumer market will bear," he said.

There are also fears that the merger would lead to a similar level of control over broadband networks, which Moffett pointed out raises its own set of concerns surrounding Net neutrality. Again, the fear is that Comcast will control so much of the nation's broadband infrastructure that it will force content providers to pay fees or threaten to block or intentionally slow traffic. But Moffett said that even these concerns are likely overblown.

"It is the broadband concerns that will likely attract the more visceral reactions," Moffett said. "But truth be told, the rules governing anticompetitive behavior are probably already relatively well suited to prevent anything egregious, including almost any violations of Net neutrality, with or without Net neutrality-specific rules."###3268||* HSI -1.6 pct, H-shares -1.6 pct, CSI300 -1.9 pct

HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - China’s CSI300 index slid to its lowest in nearly nine months early Monday, weighing on Hong Kong markets, after data showed exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, reigniting some fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

Data over the weekend also showed inflation remained benign, but some investors were more concerned that producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month, as the lack of pricing power suggested China is still struggling with excess capacity.

At midday, the CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was down 1.9 percent at its lowest since June 25. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 1.7 percent.

The Hang Seng Index shed 1.6 percent to 22,294.9 points, its lowest since Feb. 26. The China Enterprises Index of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also sank 1.6 percent to its lowest in a month.

“Markets are over-reacting a little today, nobody’s caring too much about the data skew from the different timing of the Chinese New Year this year from last year,” said Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Finance.

“That said, my longer-term prognosis on China remains pessimistic. Unless you see a turnaround in producer prices, which would suggest they are getting excess capacity under control, it’s not possible to play the China macro game,” Wong added.

Cyclical counters Anhui Conch Cement fell 4.7 percent in Hong Kong and 3.8 percent in Shanghai. Jiangxi Copper tumbled 4.5 percent to an eight-month low in Hong Kong and 4.8 percent in Shanghai.

China’s consumer prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a bigger risk.

Exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 percent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday. Imports rose 10.1 percent, yielding a trade deficit of $23 billion for the month versus a surplus of $32 billion in January.

Markets failed to take any cheer from an official China Securities Journal commentary on Monday, which highlighted the difficulty of hitting this year’s 7.5 percent growth target, while suggesting policies aimed at balancing overall reform with stable growth are likely due in the second quarter.

In Hong Kong, China Construction Bank sank 1.9 percent, as did China Cinda Asset Management, which was created to manage bad debts.

Nomura banking analyst Lucy Feng on Monday recommended a long Cinda and short CCB trade. She downgraded CCB to neutral on rising concerns of property-related loans.

A plunging yuan further weighed on airlines, port operators, shippers and exporters. China’s yuan opened trade at 6.1554 per dollar on Monday, down 0.5 percent from Friday’s close of 6.1260. If losses hold, this would be the currency’s biggest one-day loss since December 2008.

China Southern Airlines underperformed the airlines sector in Hong Kong, sinking 3.5 percent. Further hurting the stock was news that two passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight had bought tickets using stolen passports through the Chinese carrier on a code-share basis.

“That incident will inevitably weigh on sentiment on its stock,” said Ample Finance’s Wong.

The world's biggest automaker said the move will see the lockout of about 6,400 employees at the factories in southern India.

Company and union officials had been trying to sign a new contract for the past 10 months, with the local government helping mediate negotiations.

"In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days," Toyota said in a statement.

"All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lockout notice. With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," it added.

A Tokyo-based company spokesman said Toyota hoped to restart production quickly, but could not give a timeline for any re-opening of the plants, which make a range of models including the flagship Camry sedan, the Corolla and the Prius hybrid.

The two plants, near the city of Bangalore, produce about 310,000 units annually, the carmaker said.

The automaker’s focus now is to convince customers, regulators and lawmakers that it’s responding as quickly as possible after recalling 1.6 million vehicles linked to more than a dozen deaths.

Worse, GM must answer hard questions about who knew what and when. Its preliminary chronology indicates that some GM employees knew as long ago as 2004 that a faulty ignition switch on some models could kill the engine in a moving car, disabling airbags, making steering difficult and leading to crashes.

For reasons not fully known, GM did not initiate a recall until Feb. 13 of this year, then expanded it Feb. 25 to about twice as many models. It now covers the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky.

And remember that GM employs thousands of North Texans at its Arlington assembly plant. Problems in Detroit radiate across America. GM officials can ask their counterparts at Toyota how safety issues can shake a company’s foundation.

New CEO Mary Barra supposedly had no knowledge of the ignition-switch problem before she initiated the recall, writing to employees that she “acted without hesitation.” This week, GM brought in Anton Valukas to head its internal investigation. He’s the Chicago lawyer who led the court-ordered investigation of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.

GM will get plenty of uninvited outside help. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, has announced it will hold hearings. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller says he will order them, too. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation, as it did four years ago with Toyota’s unintended acceleration problems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given GM until April 3 to answer 107 questions about how it handled the issue.

The NHTSA might also request a mirror. Joan Claybrook, the agency’s former head, wants the parent U.S. Department of Transportation to investigate why the NHTSA failed to order a recall despite knowing about the ignition-switch problem as far back as 2007. Claybrook, now a safety advocate, says her former agency also “failed to carry out the law” by not forcing GM to fix the problem.

Soon, we’ll run out of fingers to point.

Claybrook, as much as anyone, understands that the NHTSA’s credibility is at stake with an American public wary of the cozy relationships that can develop between regulators and the regulated.

If an automaker like General Motors isn’t moving fast enough to protect its customers from potentially dangerous product flaws, who speaks for those customers?

The answer, in this case, appears to have been no one. For the sake of an iconic American company and, more important, the people who buy its products, we deserve a stronger and timelier response than this.

Missed opportunities

2004: GM concedes it knew in 2004, before it launched the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, that the ignition switch might inadvertently move from “run” to “accessory,” stalling the engine and cutting power to safety systems.

2005: A partial fix in key design is proposed but not adopted. Dealers are told to modify existing keys with an insert and to tell owners to take extra items off their keychains if they complain of stalling problems.

2007: Federal safety officials tell GM that a 2005 fatal Cobalt crash involved a switch that malfunctioned and airbags that failed to deploy.

2009: GM adopts the key design proposed in 2005.

2013: GM determines that switches made before the 2006 modifications failed to meet design specifications.

2014: Finally, GM announces and expands its recall of vehicles with faulty ignition switches.###3274||Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

BANK of England governor Mark Carney has warned there is a "distinct possibility" that the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move outside of Scotland if voters back independence.

MPs were also told that the rest of the UK was likely to end up bailing out Scotland in the event of a crisis if there was a currency union even if there were explicit guarantees written into an agreement ruling out such an event.

European laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit Scotland, the Treasury select committee heard.

Asked if RBS would have to move to the remaining UK if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: "It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it.

"It depends on their arrangements as well, if they were to adjust more into Scotland the minor management of the institution."

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: "Distinct possibility is a central bank phrase with a sort of layer of lawyer on top."

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK.

First Minister Alex Salmond's Scottish Government wants to create a "sterling zone" with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Mr Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to the eurozone.

He told MPs today that the Bank of England did not have to be the lender of last resort to Scottish banks if there was no formal currency union and would be "very conscious of the exposure to the public balance sheet".

Mr Carney said there would be "advantages" to an independent Scotland if it became part of a EU banking union but it would not have a common deposit guarantee scheme and lender of last resort negotiations would have to be made.

"Does it make it more viable?" he added. "It's a mechanism, there's a wide range of factors which would determine viability and viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant. You can't be half viable in a currency union.

"You need all the components. It would advance it but the other components would need to be put in place so you have to look at the package."

Mr Carney suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis.

He told MPs: "There's famously a no-bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but when push came to shove with risks in the periphery that was not fully credible because the spillover effects of not bailing out, or not assisting in some sort of arrangement, were judged, in the teeth of a global crisis, to be too great to risk and so there were extraordinary efforts made, and appropriate efforts, made by European officials to avoid that.

"The issue for the rest of the UK would be would it be credible, I'm not predicting this but one has to plan for contingencies, would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?

"If it is not credible then the structure of the currency union obviously is less than perfect but it is also taking on a contingent liability or responsibility to the rest of the UK balance sheet.

"So, these are all issues that have to be thought through in advance."

Pressed on whether he was going "a long way down the road of saying" that experience showed any system of rules would be vulnerable to the risk of bailouts, he replied: "My view is that the eurozone needs to build that form of fiscal federalism to be viable."

Mr Carney dismissed claims that he thought a currency union was a bad idea for the UK and something he did not support.

He said: "I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments.

"At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate."

When it was suggested that he had created a "less than optimistic picture", he told MPs his intention was to draw attention to the underlying economic issues.###3275||Empty###3276||Sometimes it seems like not a week goes by without news of some bitcoin service getting hacked and losing everything.

Thankfully, such attacks are rarer than that. But given the size of the bitcoin economy, they are still far, far more common than they have any right to be. A look at the history of bitcoin hacks is a look at the history of bitcoin itself, from its beginnings all the way to the genesis of the professionalised second generation of firms we’re seeing now.

In the interests of fairness, we haven’t covered the black market. While the disappearance of sites like Sheep and Silk Road took a lot of bitcoins with them, that says more about what happens if you dabble in drug dealing than cryptocurrencies overall.

Allinvain

It’s not a bitcoin service, but honorary mention has to go to Allinvain, a member of the BitcoinTalk forums who, in June 2011, became the first person to suffer a major loss owing to a bitcoin hack.

25,000 bitcoins were stolen from their wallet after hackers compromised the Windows computer they were using. Even at the time, that sum was worth more than $500,000; it would now be worth a little less than £10m.

Mt Gox

The first MtGox hack came a little after Allinvain’s. The company, which at the time had a near-monopoly on the trade between bitcoins and real money, suffered a catastrophic hack just one week later.

An attacker with a Hong Kong IP address compromised an account on the site, and then made a massive sale of bitcoins, causing the price of the currency to drop from $32.00 per coin to mere pennies. Ironically, the hackers themselves didn’t even manage to profit from it; their attempts to withdraw the looted money hit up against Mt Gox’s withdrawal limit of $1000 a day.

That didn’t stop the attack having a catastrophic effect on confidence in the currency. It was 18 months before bitcoin would recover enough to hit the highs it had been at before MtGox’s hack.

Bitcoin Savings and Trust

Following the collapse of the first bitcoin bubble, hacking activity died down for a bit. With bitcoins worth single-digit dollars, there was less motivation to steal them. But in the summer of 2012, one of the biggest – in bitcoin terms – scams ever began to fall apart. And unlike much in the bitcoin world, no hacks were needed, just good old-fashioned fraud.

Bitcoin Savings and Trust was a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme, that posed as a virtual hedge fund promising to pay high rates of interest to investors. In classic pyramid style, only the first people to invest ever saw those rates of return, as the money of later investors was used to pay off early ones.

The fund was started in November 2011, and by July 2012 users were expressing doubt. But new members carried on joining for another month until August 17th, when Trendon Shavers - the man behind the scheme - announced he was closing it. A year later, the SEC issued a lawsuit against Shavers for running the Ponzi. Over 700,000 bitcoins went through the trust, and Shavers creamed off 150,000 for himself – returning the rest to investors. But only those who got in there early.

Bitcoinica

At the same time as Bitcoin Savings and Trust was collapsing, a bitcoin exchange was suffering its own legal troubles. Bitcoinica had already been hacked in March 2012, and lost thousands of bitcoins. But the hack wasn’t enough to bring the company down, and Bitcoincia promised that it would pay back users in full. In May that year, the company was hacked again; that time, it was a killing blow. The company closed its website, and promised to refund 50% of customers holdings.

Five months later, that promise still hadn’t been honoured, and four San Franciscan users sued the company for the $460,000 they felt they were owed. It was the second ever US lawsuit involving Bitcoin.

The Bitcoinica story ended unresolved. The company built its service around MtGox, and so, once it shut down in May 2012, the bitcoins it had left stayed dormant in that account while the legal situation was sorted out. Which meant that when MtGox lost all its bitcoins and closed its doors, the Bitcoinica account holders finally lost everything.

BitFloor

The summer of 2012 was a bad time for bitcoin exchanges. BitFloor suffered its own break-in in September, losing 24,000 bitcoins when a hacker “accessed an unencrypted backup of wallet keys“.

The exchange paused operations, with the founder, Roman Shtylman, saying that “I felt it inappropriate to continue operating not having the capability to cover all account balances for BTC at the time.” The company eventually managed to pay most users back, albeit only in dollars.

Inputs.io

If there’s one type of bitcoin business which has a bad name, it’s online wallet services. In theory, they let individual users offload the problems of securing their bitcoins to a trusted third party, while also allowing payments to be made easily and lowering the technical know-how required to get and store the currency.

In practice, they are the most tempting target for hackers in the entire ecosystem. Since they don’t interact with the traditional banking system to the same degree as bitcoin exchanges, the barrier to entry is far lower, presenting no shortage of potential opportunities.

Inputs.io was one such service. In two hacks in late October 2013, the company lost 4,100 bitcoins, worth over $1m at the time. (At current prices they would be worth $2.5m). The site’s founder, known as TradeFortress, announced the hacks – and subsequent closure of the site – in a post headlined “:(“. He subsequently recommended against anyone using services like his: “Please don’t store Bitcoins on an internet connected device, regardless of [if] it is your own or a service’s.”

That advice leads to its own problems: if users aren’t storing their bitcoins – or, more accurately, the private key to their bitcoins – on an internet connected device, spending their money becomes difficult.

BIPS

A few weeks after Inputs.io, another wallet service was hacked. BIPS lost 1,295 bitcoin from its own accounts, as well as money from “several” consumer wallets. The company disclosed the theft rather quicker than Inputs.io did, but still waited 11 days from the first hack attempt to finally telling customers that they had lost money.

In that time, the value of the stolen bitcoins rose from $650,000 to over $1m – though by the end of December, the third bitcoin bubble had popped, and the value had fallen back down to $690,000.

Picostocks

Even niche bitcoin firms aren’t immune. Picostocks is an attempt to become one of the first bitcoin stock markets. Although it currently has just four companies trading on it – one of which is Picostocks itself – that didn’t stop hackers making off with 6000 BTC in late November 2013.

The company announced the loss on Reddit, and confirmed it would be offline for a week (a “:-(“ emoticon ended the message). Impressively, it survived the loss, worth almost $6m at the time and is still trading today.

Cointerra

Bitcoins are created by “mining” for them, a computationally intensive task which involves deliberately wasting processing power to prove that you aren’t an attacker bent on cheating the network. Cointerra makes hardware specifically for mining: they currently sell a $6000 computer can do the required tasks 6 trillion times a second. That could earn up to $50,000 a month – but such an investment is speculating, not only on the price of Bitcoin, but also on the number of other people trying to mine for bitcoins. Of course, you have to pay for electricity as well. The box is rated for around 2100W of power – equivalent to running an electric kettle all day every day. And it puts off that much heat as well, so try not to keep it somewhere too hot.

But making the hardware which powers the very backbone of bitcoin didn’t stop Cointerra’s email servers from getting hacked in early February. The company takes bitcoin for payments, naturally, but only through a third party company, meaning that its money was never at risk, but the firm had to warn customers to be wary of phishing attempts. “If you have placed an order and paid via bitcoin since 31 January and have been contacted via email by any person purporting to be a CoinTerra representative offering to discount your order… please contact us immediately,” the firm warned customers.

Mt Gox, part two

On February 24, MtGox closed its website and announced that it had been hacked, again. This time, it had lost everything: the sum total of its bitcoin holdings were just 2000BTC, according to a leaked crisis document, while it owed customers around 750,000BTC. It was £284m in the hole.

The immediate reaction of some was hope. Not for the money lost in the Mt Gox collapse, which represented 7% of all bitcoins in existence (for comparison, 7% of all pound notes is somewhere in the order of £4bn). That seems to be gone forever. Instead, there’s hope that it can signal the beginning of a new age for the currency, one which takes it away from hacking, crime and fly-by-night businesses and towards the professionalism of venture-backed startups like Coinbase and Bitpay, two of the most respected firms in the area.

But is that hope misplaced?

Flexcoin, Poloniex, Bitcurex & Canadian Bitcoins

The week after MtGox’s closure two more bitcoin businesses shut their doors after hacking. They even announced the news on the same day. Flexcoin, a bitcoin bank, lost almost 1000 bitcoins in a hacking attack, while bitcoin exchange Poloniex admitted that 12.3% of its reserves had been stolen due to an unbelievable error in coding (the site failed to check whether users had a negative balance, letting them withdraw more bitcoins than they had).

This week, Bitcurex, a Polish bitcoin exchange, closed its doors temporarily after a hack brought down its Zloty and Euro exchanges. The company lost “between 10 and 20%” of funds, according to a statement, but plans to re-open shortly.

And just today, Canadian Bitcoins, a Canadian bitcoin exchange, revealed it had lost almost $100,000 in the currency when a fraudster opened a chat session with the exchange’s hosting provider. “He claimed to have a problem with a server and asked the attendant to reboot it into recovery mode, allowing him to bypass security on the server,” according to the Ottawa Citizen. At no point in the two-hour session was he asked to prove his identity.

It may be that we’re just seeing the last gasps of the old bitcoin infrastructure, held together with glue and hope by coders who threw it together in a lunch break. But there is little doubt that the history of the currency to date can be told in its hacks.###3277||Households across the country were today invited to “celebrate” when the Bank of England finally hikes interest rates after five years at 0.5 per cent.

Outgoing deputy governor Charlie Bean told a business audience that there were “clear signs” the economy was on the mend and that the Monetary Policy Committee was “doing its utmost to ensure that the recovery is not nipped in the bud”.

He added: “When the time does come for us to start raising the Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.”

Bean hailed signs of a recovery in business investment but added that the UK’s export recovery had been “somewhat disappointing” and flagged up a 10 per cent rise in the value of the pound over the past year as contributing to that. “Any further appreciation of sterling … would not be particularly helpful,” he added.

While a rate rise will be good news for savers, rising mortgage payments will hit millions of homeowners on floating-rate deals when rates finally go up.

Financial markets believe borrowing costs will begin to rise in the spring of next year although Bean urged against “getting too hung up on the precise date” of the first rate hike.

The deputy Governor said the past five years had been “tough for both businesses and households”, but they would have been tougher still without the MPC’s emergency liquidity action.###3278||BEIJING — China announced on Saturday a modest easing of exchange rate controls that have been criticized by Washington and other trading partners, adding to a flurry of reform initiatives aimed at making its slowing economy more efficient.

The range in which the tightly controlled yuan is allowed to fluctuate against the dollar each day will double in size, though to a still relatively narrow 2 percent.

The move was widely expected after Premier Li Keqiang promised in an annual policy speech last week to give market forces a "decisive role" in allocating credit and other resources in the state-dominated economy.

The ruling Communist Party says it wants to inject more competition into the economy and nurture self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

In a steady drumbeat of recent changes, authorities also have announced plans to create China's first privately financed banks and promised to ease the tax and regulatory burden on entrepreneurs.

Widening the trading band will help to "optimize the efficiency of capital allocation and market allocation of resources to accelerate economic development," the central bank said in a statement.

The U.S. Treasury Department had no immediate reaction to the announcement.

China's rapid economic growth tumbled to a two-decade low of 7.7 percent last year. This year's official growth target is slightly lower at 7.5 percent, but Li said this week Beijing will be flexible about it as long as the economy generates enough new jobs.

Washington and other governments complain Beijing suppresses the value of the yuan, unfairly making Chinese exports cheaper abroad and hurting foreign competitors.

The relatively small size of Saturday's change appeared unlikely to mollify Beijing's foreign critics. Some U.S. lawmakers have demanded punitive tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing failed to ease controls, but the White House has resisted imposing sanctions.

Beijing reported a $260 billion global trade surplus last year, a $30 billion increase over 2012 and among the largest ever recorded by any country.

Chinese leaders say they plan eventually to let the yuan float freely, but private sector analysts say that might be decades away.

Beijing is reluctant to allow big changes in the currency for fear of hurting exporters that employ millions of workers. But analysts say they might have gained confidence from recent strong trade performance.

Allowing the yuan to rise in value would increase the buying power of Chinese households, helping to achieve the ruling party's goal of nurturing more sustainable economic growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

A stronger yuan also could help to suppress pressure for politically sensitive consumer prices to rise by making imports cheaper.

Reform advocates say that by suppressing the yuan's value, Beijing has been forcing even poor households to subsidize exporters.

In recent weeks, the central bank has been guiding the yuan's exchange lower against the dollar in what analysts said was an effort to discourage speculators who are moving money into China to profit from the currency's rise.

Beijing allowed the yuan to gain about 20 percent against the dollar beginning in 2005 but movement stopped after the 2008 global crisis as the government tried to protect struggling exporters.

The yuan has been trading at about six to the dollar. Analysts say Beijing might allow that to rise to 5.88 to the dollar by mid-2014, a rise of about 2 percent. That would be small by global currency market standards but unusually large for China.###3279||SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gold held on to overnight gains on Wednesday to trade near its highest in four months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal.FUNDAMENTALSSpot gold eased 0.1 percent to $1,347.40 an ounce by 0027 GMT, after gaining 0.8 percent on Tuesday.Ukraine's government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days.China's first bond default and weak data on exports ...###3280||###3281||Empty###3282||The fatality was particularly shocking because it comes as Metro-North is under increased federal scrutiny after accidents that left four passengers and a railroad foreman dead.

Take the humble ankle sprain, one of the most common injuries among young adults under the age of 25. Treating it can cost $2,290. Then there's the broken arm: On average $7,700. And people without health insurance get to pay full freight.

Or as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius put it in a government blog: "This can be a huge financial blow to young people and families alike."

That is the message the administration hopes will be heard by college-age kids and others who do not have health insurance, but could qualify for federal subsidies to help purchase coverage. Some could also qualify for the Medicaid health program for the poor.

Open enrollment ends March 31.

In a promotion aimed at fans of the annual college basketball playoff series known as March Madness, Sebelius' Department of Health and Human Services and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition released data looking at the economic costs of common sports injuries like sprains and fractures - just the sort of thing to send a young person to the emergency room.

Young people are vital to the success of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Obamacare prevents insurance companies from penalizing people who are sick or older. And so the new marketplaces need young people who are cheaper to insure to make up for the higher financial risks posed by others.

But so far, the administration's target audience of people aged 18 to 34 have not been signing up in such large numbers, a trend that could lead to higher insurance costs down the road if it continues.

More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare, according to the administration. But the latest breakdown shows the number of younger adults stuck at 25 percent of the enrollment population, versus the 38 percent target that the administration laid out before last October's botched rollout.

Administration officials say younger people could sign up in huge numbers in the final days of the open enrollment period.###3284||Sponsored

David Holohan is head of research at Merrion Stockbrokers in Ireland.

"The decision to have the headquarters in Dublin is really just aligned to facilitate the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, which will come from Fyffes, and they're currently based in Dublin at the moment," he said.

Holohan said it also doesn't hurt that Ireland charges about a third of what the U.S. does in corporate income taxes.

But a Chiquita spokesman said the company will still have a major footprint in Charlotte. For one, some executives will still be here, like current CEO Ed Lonergan, who'll become chairman.

Also, the company is still on track to employ about 400 people in Charlotte. It'll need to do that in order to cash in the big incentives deal the state and city promised when Chiquita moved here in 2012.

The Chiquita spokesman and Charlotte's mayor say the merger doesn't appear to impact those incentives, which could add up to more than $20 million.###3289||OK

Gold is the best-known and most popular precious metal, and it’s not hard to see why.

Beyond being a key material for jewelry, investors around the world use the yellow metal as a store of wealth, and many believe it’s superior to any and all paper currencies. Storing wealth with a sense of stability is a popular reason for gold investing.

Yet despite its popularity, the gold price is currently languishing well below its 2011 peak of nearly $1,900 per ounce. It took a steep dive midway through 2013, slipping to about $1,220; it then remained between $1,100 and $1,300 for much of 2014 and 2015.

Since then it’s staged a bit of a recovery, rising above $1,300 in 2016. In 2017, however, the gold price stayed below $1,300 with the exception of brief increases midway through and late in the year. So far 2018 has been a mixed bag for the yellow metal — while it was able to stay above $1,300 for much of the first half of the year it has since sunk to nearly $1,200.

Gold investing: Supply and demand

When the gold price began to fall in 2013, market watchers expected some mine production to come off the market; however, most gold producers opted to lower salaries and cut employees rather than reduce their output. Many producing gold companies also chose to reduce exploration in order to keep their existing operations afloat.

In 2016, the tide began to turn for gold investing. As mentioned, the gold price recovered somewhat that year, even rising above $1,300. However, times were still tough for exploration — in fact, even two years later the consensus is that not enough money is being spent on finding new gold deposits. Even so, gold mine production was flat from 2016 to 2017 at 3,268 tonnes, and is expected to grow this year.

Most gold is produced in China, with Australia and Russia being the second and third top producers. Respectively, they put out 300 MT, 270 MT and 255 MT of the yellow metal in 2017.

Looking at consumption, gold demand fell 7 percent year-on-year in 2017 to a total of 4,308.7 tonnes. ETF inflows were less than the previous year, and bar and coin demand fell as well, although just by 2 percent. China and India are major consumers of physical gold, and the title of world’s largest gold consumer is often a toss up between the two.

As a side note on supply and demand, investors should be aware that most of the gold ever mined still exists and is accessible — for example, as jewelry or bullion. In contrast, many other metals come off the market when they are used. That means that the gold space is also affected by saving and disposal tactics, and not just by simple supply and demand.

Gold investing: Economics and manipulation

While supply and demand are key factors in the gold market, it’s important for investors entering and operating in the space to be aware that they’re not the only things that can have an impact on the metal.

In particular, global economics can have a drastic effect on gold. Put simply, gold earns no interest, and thus tends to fare better when interest rates are lower; conversely, when interest rates are higher, it becomes less desirable as an investment.

Interestingly, that relationship has been less visible in recent years. In March, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the sixth time in three years, and rather than sinking the gold price increased. Experts have suggested that the reason the hike did not result in a gold price decline is that it was already “baked into” the market — in other words, traders had been anticipating an increase.

Gold investing is also often favored by investors as a safe haven in times of economic and political turmoil. There are countless instances of people flocking to gold investing in times of uncertainty — for example, gold and gold stocks got a bump after US President Donald Trump canceled a meeting with the leader of North Korea, and again when Trump told Russia to “get ready” for US missiles fired at Syria.

Price manipulation is also a concern in the gold space, but luckily it’s one that the world’s gold market participants are keen to address. Indeed, early in 2015, the long-running London gold fix was replaced by the LBMA gold price in a bid to increase gold price transparency. Though the process still involves a variety of banks collaborating to set the gold price, the system is now electronic.

Gold investing: The future

While the gold price may be lower than investors would like, it’s clear that interest in the metal remains strong around the world. Those keen on gold investing would do well to remember that like most markets, the gold sector is cyclical, meaning that what goes down must eventually rise again — although by how much is anyone’s guess.

Bank of England concern about the pound's strength has been revealed in comments from one of Threadneedle Street's top officials, who has said a further rise in sterling would damage hopes of an export boost to the economy.

Charlie Bean, one of the Bank's two deputy governors, said the UK's recent trade performance had been unimpressive despite help from a sharp fall in the value of the currency in the 18 months after the financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007.

The pickup in growth since spring 2013 has been accompanied by an increase of almost 10% in the pound's value against a basket of world currencies, and Bean said any further appreciation would be unwelcome.

Speaking in Darlington, the Bank's deputy governor for monetary policy said a rebalancing of growth towards exports was needed to ensure Britain's recovery was "sustained and sustainable".

He said: "The prerequisites for such a switch of demand towards net exports seemed to have been put in place by the substantial depreciation in sterling that occurred during the financial crisis. Sterling fell more than 25% between the middle of 2007 and the beginning of 2009.

"Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports. The performance of exports – particularly exports of services – has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing."

Bean said anecdotal evidence of businesses bringing back to the UK activities that they had previously "offshored" could mean it was simply a matter of time before the UK began to close a current account deficit worth 4% of national output in 2013.

"But any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports."###3292||Empty###3293||The accident caused disruptions for about two hours.

The incident is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police. But preliminary findings indicate Romansoff went beyond a protected work zone while restoring power to the section of the track, 1010 WINS’ Al Jones reported.

The National Transportation Safety Board is also looking into the incident, WCBS 880’s Peter Haskell reported.

Metro-North Worker Struck, Killed By Train

“I was shocked and very dismayed to hear about this, it’s a horrible, tragic situation,” Arthur Davidson, general chairman of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers System Council 7, told 1010 WINS.

Sen. Charles Schumer, speaking to reporters at Grand Central Terminal on Monday, said there has been a disturbing pattern with Metro-North.

Last May, a track foreman was killed in West Haven. Conn., and in December, four people were killed when a train derailed in the Bronx.

“Collisions, power failures, derailments, injuries and even deaths,” said Schumer, D-N.Y.

“Something is wrong in the culture of safety.”

As of March 1, a new safety protocol designed to prevent such fatal incidents went into effect.

The Enhanced Employee Protection System prevents dispatchers from sending trains through when employees are working on the tracks until a specific code is received.

“We believe it will set a new standard for the railroad industry,” spokeswoman Marjorie Anders told The Journal News before the system went into effect.

The EEP system “takes the human error out of the equation,” Anthony Bottalico with the Association of Commuter Rail Employees told The Journal News.

Asked if the new safety protocols were being followed in Monday’s accident, an MTA spokesperson told Haskell that Metro-North does follow its procedures.

The union represents 1,700 Metro-North employees.

"If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case," Bean said.



The BoE lawmaker added that the recovery in the UK could be hindered mainly by problems in the Eurozone or by tensions in emerging markets as well as a bubble forming in the domestic housing market. Only when the recovery is certain will the BoE be able to sell gilts it has bought.

Today its been reported by Reuters that King Digital Entertainment expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public later this month.

Both the recent surge in Facebook share price as well as the successful IPO of Twitter back in November of last year have fuelled speculation that a number of technology firms are considering filling for IPO in the near future.

Now King Digital Entertainment is hoping to take advantage of the strong demand for technology investments. However a company with only a couple of popular game titles to its name might end up being yet another Zynga.

King Digital Entertainment is scheduled to be priced on March 25th 2014 and the stock will start trading on March 26th, two underwriters have divulged to Reuters who explain’s:

“The Dublin-based company will sell 15.5 million shares in the offering, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company’s games more than 1.4 billion times per day, the filing showed. The King IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million at the top-end of the planned range. It filed for a $500 million placeholder in February.”

As you read through this motion about Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) FANNIE MAE, it is really quite stunning. I’ve gone ahead and marked it up for you to make is easier…

FHFA produced 4300 pages for this case….only 25 were previously not public and they ADMIT they did not keep an administrative record in their actions here. This is unfathomable that a gov’t agency dealing with the issues it was dealing with kept no record……none.

If you throw out every other argument here, just this fact along give the Judge a reason to permit discovery

Further releasing only 25 previously non public documents is laughable. For the record, Treasury was better, releasing 205 of 4200 pages that were previously not public…..but it is still pathetic.

This is a slap in the face to the entire process and proof either the gov’t just assumes they will win, or has a hell of a lot to hide here. My guess it is a little of both.

The entire case from the gov’t still boils down to “we said we could do what we did so this case should be thrown out”. It’s absurd.

Plaintiffs claim that FHFA and Treasury worked together in placing the bet worth sweep in place and thus FHFA breached its fiduciary duty thus the sweep is invalid (boiled down to the most simple).

The gov’t response is “no we didn’t…case over”. They produced no documentation to back this claim at all……not anything. Check that, they produced one affidavit from a Mr. Ugoletti (council at FHFA) that states the action taken at FHFA were entirely appropriate. The only issue here is that this affidavit was dated two month AFTER the suit was filed….rendering is useless at best.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its US joint-venture stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create Spain's top integrated services provider.



"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said in a statement.



"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market," he said.



"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."



The transaction, worth the equivalent of 6 billion Great Britain pounds, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.



Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.





Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition."This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement."As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect," he said."The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Oil blockade has slashed vital government revenues.



By Ulf Laessing and Ghaith Shennib



Libya on Monday stopped a North Korean-flagged tanker that had loaded oil from a rebel-held port, after naval forces briefly exchanged fire with the rebels, officials said.



But in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for Libya, rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran denied in a televised statement broadcast from a ship that he had lost control of the oil tanker.



The LIbyan officials also said the government will assemble forces to "liberate" all occupied ports, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenue.



The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the OPEC producer may slide deeper into chaos or even splinter as the fragile government fails to rein in dozens of militias that helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority.



The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth in the North African country, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.



Prime Minister Ali Zeidan told Reuters naval forces had seized the North Korean-flagged tanker outside the eastern Es Sider port controlled by rebels and were taking it to a government port in western Libya.



"The ship is around 20 miles from Es Sider," Zeidan said. "It stopped due to darkness and won't move tonight but is under complete control and secured. Tomorrow it will move."



Naval forces had halted the ship after a brief firefight with the rebels, Culture Minister and government spokesman Habib al-Amin later told reporters. Nobody had been wounded, but he warned opening fire again might damage nearby oil facilities.



But rebel leader Jathran appeared on the television station of his movement after midnight and denied Tripoli's forces had surrounded the tanker.



Speaking from a ship, Jathran vowed to keep selling oil independently of the government, and blasted the United States for earlier criticizing the crude loading. The station did not identify the ship he was standing on, but it appeared to be smaller than the 37,000-tonne oil tanker.



Even without any major military action, the escalation kills any hope of restoring oil exports soon. A wave of protests at oilfields and ports has reduced Libyan output to a trickle, undermining state authority because oil is the main revenue source supporting the budget and basic food imports.



The head of parliament, who has quasi-presidential powers, ordered the formation of a force made up of regular soldiers and allied militias to take back the occupied ports, which previously handled more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day.



The operation will start within one week, parliament head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain said in a decree published by spokesman Omar Hmeidan. "The force will be set up to liberate the ports and end the blockage," Hmeidan told Reuters.



Zeidan, who said on Saturday the tanker would be bombed if it tried to export oil, said military action was only one of several options.



"What is confirmed it that all ports will be liberated from the occupiers with all means possible," he said. "We prefer talks but if talks fail then the state will act."



Zeidan said authorities would unload the crude from the tanker once it reached a western port and then launch legal measures against the potential buyers.



DEFIANT REBELS

Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi's ousting, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled the dictator.



Still, the force will be drawn from cities such as Misrata that are home to fighters who saw battle in the civil war, according to the decree. Misrata forces were sent earlier this year to fight in clashes deep in Libya's south.



Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, the self-declared rebel prime minister, called on "all honourable men" in the east to join his forces, a rebel television station reported.



The rebels, made up of former oil security guards, said they had sent forces by land and sea to central Libya to confront any government attackers.



FULL CONFRONTATION UNLIKELY

While the navy did open fire on a Maltese-flagged tanker trying to approach Es Sider in January, analysts say a full military confrontation with the rebels would be unlikely.



Jathran, the leader of the protesters, is a former anti-Gaddafi commander who was in charge of protecting oilfields and ports until he turned against the government in the summer.



His campaign to seek more rights for Libya's underdeveloped east has won him some sympathy, but many people dismiss him as a tribal warlord with no political vision.



Libya's top Islamic clerics urged militias who had helped topple Gaddafi to help the government in trying to stop the tanker, according to a statement read on television.



The United Nations' special envoy to Libya, Tarek Mitri, told the U.N. Security Council on Monday that the loading of oil onto the North Korean-flagged vessel "constitutes an illegal act and violates Libya's sovereignty over its ports and natural resources".



On Sunday, Tripoli said the navy and pro-government militias had sent boats to stop the tanker from leaving. The vessel had arrived at Es Sider on Saturday.



It is unusual for a tanker flagged to secretive North Korea to sail in the Mediterranean. Shipping sources said it was a flag of convenience to keep the ship's ownership secret.



In a rare bright spot, state National Oil Corp managed to restart the southern El Sharara oilfield after a protest ended there, a spokesman said. It is now pumping 150,000 barrels per day and might reach full capacity at 340,000 bpd by Tuesday afternoon.###3307||Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (DKS ) reported higher fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, which were in line with analysts’ estimates.

No one was hurt in the operation, which was approved by US President Barack Obama at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters southeast of Cyprus, said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra," his statement said, adding that the tanker will be "underway soon to a port in Libya" with a team of US sailors aboard.

The Morning Glory reportedly loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude. It departed from the eastern Libyan port of Al-Sidra, which is controlled by rebels seeking autonomy from the authorities in Tripoli.

Pyongyang on Wednesday however denied any responsibility for the tanker.

The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.

Pyongyang had "cancelled and deleted" the ship's North Korean registry, as it violated its law "on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo".

"Therefore, the ship has nothing to do" with North Korea, which "has no responsibility whatsoever as regards the ship," KCNA said.

Date created : 2014-03-17###3309||European car sales rose 7.6% in February, as a gradual economic recovery in Portugal, Spain and Italy boosted demand for mass market brands, industry data showed today.

New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association trading block rose for the sixth consecutive month to 894,730 vehicles in February from 831,371 in the same month last year.

This is according to data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA).

Europe's car industry endured a six-year slump, with car sales falling to their lowest level in two decades as austerity-hit consumers cut back on expensive purchases, but the market has recently returned to growth.

While registrations in top car market Germany underperformed the regional trend with a 4.3% increase and fell by 1.4% in Europe's second-biggest car market France, sales grew in double digits in some states most hit by the crisis.

Sales in Spain, Portugal and Ireland grew by 17.8%, 40.2% and 20.6%, respectively, showing that a fragile recovery in the region was gaining momentum.

In Italy, the region's fourth-biggest market which is recovering from its longest recession in 70 years, sales grew 8.6%.

Sales at Renault Group jumped 11.5%, boosted mainly by a 33.6% surge in registrations of its no-frills Dacia brand. Ford sales were up 11.3%, Toyota Group, the world's biggest-selling car maker, posted a 14% increase, while General Motors saw sales go up 12.3%, boosted by a 15.6% increase in registrations of its Opel and Vauxhall branded vehicles.

Germany's Volkswagen group, Europe's biggest carmaker by volume, posted a 7.2% rise, helped by a 21.5% at its value brand Skoda, a 15.7% jump in Seat sales and an 11.8% gain at its premium brand Audi. VW's performance was weighed down by a 0.8% decline in sales at its namesake brand.

French carmaker PSA lost some market share in February. Its overall sales grew 3.5%, supported by an increase in registrations of its Peugeot brand, but sales of Citroen branded cars were roughly flat year-on-year.###3310||US SPECIAL forces seized a tanker off Cyprus just after midnight on Sunday that had fled with a cargo of oil from a Libyan port, the US Department of Defence said, halting an attempt by rebels to sell petroleum on the global market.

Libyan rebels demanding a greater share of oil wealth managed to load crude onto the ship, which escaped Libya’s navy, embarrassing the government and prompting parliament to sack the prime minister.

US Navy SEALs boarded the Morning Glory tanker in international waters off Cyprus on Sunday night and took control of the vessel, which the Pentagon said was held by three armed Libyans.

A Cypriot police source said three men – described as two Israelis and a Senegalese – were detained for questioning on Saturday on suspicion of attempting to buy the tanker’s cargo, but were freed after a court refused to issue an arrest warrant.

Two of the men carried diplomatic passports – one from Senegal and one from a central African country, the security source said.

The source said they flew a Lear Jet into Cyprus on Friday evening, chartered a vessel from a yachting marina in Larnaca and headed to the tanker.

“They spoke to somebody on board the vessel, then left. At Larnaca marina police called them in for questioning,” the source said. The men left for Tel Aviv after being freed.

The tanker’s seizure by US forces is likely to prevent any more attempted oil sales by the rebels, who in August seized three export terminals accounting previously for 700,000 barrels a day of exports.

No one was hurt in the tanker raid, which was approved by US President Barack Obama and requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

“The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained” from the Libyan port of Es Sider, his statement said.

The Cypriot ministry of foreign affairs said the vessel was heading west in the Mediterranean with a US military escort. It was parked 29 km southwest of Cyprus when the operation occurred around midnight Cyprus time.

The Pentagon statement said the vessel would be returned to a Libyan port.

The tanker’s escape highlighted the weakness of government forces, which had claimed several times that the 37,000-tonne ship was under their control only for the vessel to slip into international waters after a firefight.

Libya’s government faces a budget crisis as oil production has fallen to little over 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 1.4 million bpd in summer when a wave of protests at oilfields and ports started. Oil is the main source of revenues for the budget and to fund basic food imports. (Reuters)###3311||With the rupee ruling firm against the greenback and the political pundits foreseeing a stable government at the centre leading to increased investment, the focus of the investors appears to be moving away from IT and pharma stocks to the beaten down banking, auto and capital goods counters.

What has added to the nervousness of the investors is the fact that Sun Pharma, one of the most favoured stocks in the pharma space, has come under the US FDA scanner with its Kharkhadi factory in Gujarat getting import alert from the US drug regulator. The reported observation of the Infosys CEO that the revenue growth in the 2014 fiscal would be at the lower end of the projected band saw the stock being whipped on the NSE and emerging as the biggest Nifty loser.

On the NSE, the major Nifty gainers were oil and gas stocks, banking and automobile stocks while pharma and IT stocks were seen losing momentum.

The one exception in the pharma space was Dr Reddy’s which was up sharply. BPCL gained ₹26.30 to move up to ₹439.20. The stock hit a fresh 52-week high of ₹441.30 today and has had a phenomenal run this year after falling to a yearly low of ₹255.95. Dr Reddy’s broke from the pharma pack to make a solid gain of ₹61.65 to trade at ₹2,749.15.

Another stock to hit a new yearly high was HDFC Bank which touched ₹744 before easing to ₹740.20, a gain of Rs 14.65. Kotak Mahindra Bank, which was up by ₹21.80 to ₹766.65, SBI which was up by ₹ 38.30 to ₹1683.40, Reliance that gained ₹14.60 to ₹ 885.95, Axis Bank that gained ₹22.40 to ₹1420.30 and ICICI Bank up by ₹18.95 to ₹1230.60 were among the other major gainers.

Auto stocks rev up

The auto industry provided its fair share of gainers. M&M shot up by ₹22.70 to go past the psychologically important ₹1,000 mark to ₹1,013.95, Hero MotoCorp was up by ₹33.40 to ₹2,095 and Bajaj Auto was trading at ₹1,982.20, a gain of ₹23.20. ACC was trading at ₹1,256.20, a gain of ₹24.65 and L&T was up by ₹14.60 to ₹1,232.85.

Strong rupee hits IT, pharma stocks

Surprisingly, the IT and pharma stocks were in reverse gear probably because the strong rupee ruled out possibilities of further gains due to a weak currency in the near term, in addition to the Sun Pharma development.

Infosys was the biggest Nifty loser in terms of value and percentage after it emerged that its CEO SD Shibulal, at an investor meet, had stated that the revenue growth for the company during the 2014 fiscal would be at the lower end of the 9-10 per cent guidance that the company had offered. The stock dived by 7.42 per cent or ₹ 272.45 to ₹3398.85.

This development, however, did not have any impact on other frontline IT stocks. TCS was up by ₹ 17.60 to trade at ₹ 2197.05 and HCL Tech gained ₹13.35 to trade at ₹1473.60 and Wipro was up by ₹6.30 to ₹573.05

Sun Pharma shed about 4 per cent, losing ₹24.35 to trade at ₹579.95 after the import alert it received from US FDA for its Gujarat plant. Lupin was down by ₹7.15 to ₹953.90 and Ranbaxy lost ₹ 4.55 to trade at ₹358.50.

However, Sarabjit Kour Nangra, VP - Research - Pharma, Angel Broking, Mumbai, felt that the action by US FDA "will not have major impact financially", since the plant’s share of overall company revenue was not significant. Sun Pharma has 12 USFDA facilities with 6 in the US, 3 in India and one each in Canada, Israel and Hungary. Hence, Sun Pharma was capable of meeting the US market demand from other facilities. Besides, Sun Pharma had successfully resolved such issues in the past and she maintained "neutral rating on the stock, owing to the valuations".###3312||The e-commerce giant's offering could be a record-setter in the US

Alibaba executive chairman Jack Ma

Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, has announced its plans to make a public stock offering in the US, an event that could set a record for the US IPO of a Chinese company.

The Hangzhou, China, company said in a brief statement that it has "decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States. This will make us a more global company and enhance the companys transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals."

It added that, "Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China."

Sources cited by the Wall Street Journal estimated that the IPO could raise $ÚS15 billion, but said it won't include the company's Alipay payment service or its money-market fund.

Yahoo remains a major shareholder in the Alibaba Group, a fact that is seen by many analysts as bolstering the US company's stock price at a time when its core business remains challenged.

In 2012, Yahoo reduced its stake from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, and the two companies amended their agreement so that Alibaba Group has the right to repurchase half of Yahoos remaining stake "upon a qualifying initial public offering in the future," according to a statement issued at the time.###3313||Numericable won’t increase bid for SFR





Patrick Drahi, the controlling shareholder of French cable operator Numericable Group, has said he will not be increasing his bid for Vivendi’s SFR.

In an interview with French daily Les Echos, Drahi said he had no reason to raise his offer. “I have worked seven years on this,” he commented. “I have no reason to modify it.”

Drahi’s comment comes as Altice, the Luxembourg holding group that controls Numericable, finds itself in a bidding war with French conglomerate Bouygues to buy SFR.

Altice has confirmed it had made a firm offer to Vivendi which includes €10.9 billion in cash and would grant a 32 per cent stake to Vivendi in the newly merged Numericable-SFR unit.

Bouygues on the other hand offered €10.5 billion in cash and a 46 per cent stake in a newly merged Bouygues Telecom-SFR group.

Drahi reiterated that his offer stands until Friday (March 14th). He said a merged Numericable-SFR would be based and listed and pay taxes in France, in a bid to reassure French officials. He also said he would be the president of a merged group if his offer is picked.###3314||NEW YORK – Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which raises the question – how often do people tip their baristas?

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company’s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don’t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn’t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there’s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke said. At the drive-thru location where she works, for instance, she said tips go down when it’s cold out and people are less likely to reach out and put money in the tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of whom no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview. There are no plans to bring the mobile tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn’t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they’ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.###3315||(ANSAmed) - NICOSIA - The north-Korean oil tanker Morning Glory, sighted off Cyprus last week, is being escorted by USA navy vessels as of early Monday morning οn a westerly course as Cna reports. The vessel, which is suspected of transporting stolen quantities of oil from the Sidra port in Libya, was outside the territorial waters of the Republic of Cyprus during the weekend.

Close to midnight on Sunday, the Cypriot authorities were aware of it moving in a westerly course, always within international waters. Republic of Cyprus vessels were deployed monitoring the tanker's course.



The vessel stopped once more 18 nautical miles south of Limassol.

London - World stocks paused near a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude tumbled on Monday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine. Relief that Crimea remained largely calm over the weekend helped European shares recover 0.2 percent after Friday's sharp sell-off, though the poor Chinese export numbers and general global uncertainty provided a subdued backdrop.

Merger activity in France spurred the CAC 40 but mining firms sensitive to China's appetite for raw materials weighed on Britain's FTSE 100 and German firms' exposure to Russia saw the Dax underperform again.

“People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilised now so it's tempting to buy the dip,” said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris.

Investors in Asia started the new week on a cautious note as China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18 percent year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The soft data put a damper on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report that had provided a welcome respite from a run of disappointing data.

China's CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent on Monday to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper, of which China is a major consumer, hit a four-year low in Shanghai, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan posted its biggest fall in over a month as it lost 1.4 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average shed 1 percent, as disappointing Japanese GDP data compounded the woes.

UKRAINE

Russian forces tightened their grip on Crimea over the weekend, seizing another border post and a military airfield, ahead of a planned Moscow-backed referendum on Sunday on whether the Black Sea peninsula should join Russia.

But diplomatic efforts to cool the crisis continued to calm markets as all sides expressed unease but a general desire to prevent the tensions escalating.

The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets.

The Chinese yuan opened down 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates fell amid speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.

The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China's appetite for their raw materials, lost as much as half a percent against a broadly steady U.S. dollar .

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.

The euro, in contrast, stayed within striking distance of Friday's 2-1/2 year high peak at $1.3875, touched after the European Central Bank suggested last week that the euro zone recovery was on track with no need for an extra policy push for now. That has pushed rate cut bets back.

COPPER SUFFERS

Gold edged lower for a second straight session on Monday after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal.

However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a key theme for the precious metal. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to its highest in more than a year.

The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya capped the falls.

“The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility,” said Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight.

The drop in China's exports pushed three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7 percent to $6,663.75 a tonne. It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.

Reuters###3321||Empty###3322||As was reported to be likely last week, the British telecoms group Vodafone(s vod) is to buy the Spanish fixed-line operator Ono for €7.2 billion ($10 billion).

Vodafone recently sold its stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon(s vz) for $130 billion, so it is currently swimming in money. The group traditionally has a mobile focus, but mobile-fixed convergence and consolidation is the name of the game in Europe right now, and Vodafone is trying to pick up cable and high-speed broadband assets that it can combine with its mobile offerings to save itself money and create one-stop shops for communications and home entertainment customers.

In Germany, that has involved buying Kabel Deutschland (for $10.4 billion) in order to better square up to Deutsche Telekom, which also offers a mix of fixed and mobile access and pay TV. Now the same story is being played out in Spain, where the Ono buy will help Vodafone better take on the likes of Telefonica(s tef).

Vodafone chief Vittorio Colao said in a statement on Monday that the deal represented an “attractive value creation opportunity” for his company:

“Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction — together with our fiber-to-the-home build program — will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.”

Ono, which was until now contemplating a stock market flotation, has Spain’s biggest next-generation fixed-line network, serving 1.9 million customers and passing 7.2 million homes, or 41 percent of the Spanish market. Vodafone already has its own fiber-to-the-home play in Spain – a coinvestment with Orange that aims to pass 1.5 million homes – that it said will be “refocused towards areas where Ono had limited or no network presence.”

Ono’s broadband services deliver speeds of over 200Mbps, and its pay TV product is based on TiVo. The provider owns the vast majority of the ducts in its network, so further network upgrades — which should be a way off, as its systems were recently revamped — promise to be fairly cheap.

What’s more, Vodafone — which is primarily a mobile player, don’t forget — said it intends to use Ono’s network to provide backhaul connectivity for its mobile base stations. This should save Vodafone a fortune in the coming years.

We can expect to see much more of this kind of convergence-consolidation activity in the near future. Another recent example saw Deutsche Telekom buy GTS Central Europe to provide a fixed-line complement to its mobile services in Poland and the Czech Republic.###3323||Exclusive Free E-Book

Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they have agreed to merge, creating the world's biggest banana supplier.

The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.

The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte.

ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.

Fyffes is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.

David McCann, Fyffes' chair, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chair.

Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."###3328||More Americans used public transit last year than in any year since 1956, according to a new report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).

Americans took 10.7 billion trips on subways, streetcars, buses and other forms of public transportation in 2013, according to the report, making last year the eighth year in a row with more than 10 billion trips taken on public transportation. The report found that public transit ridership in the U.S. has jumped 37.2 percent since 1995, an increase that’s outpaced population growth and vehicle miles traveled.

The last time public transit ridership was at an all-time high was 2008, when gas prices spiked in the U.S., reaching $4 and $5 per gallon in some places. In 2013, however, gas prices as a whole were lower, a fact the group says means that public transit isn’t soley reliant on transportation costs.

“Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,” Michael Melaniphy, president of APTA told the New York Times. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.”

The group said in a release that part of the reason for the spike in public transit usage was the economic recovery of some cities — with more people employed, there are more people relying on public transit to get to work every day. And, Melaniphy said, the inverse is true as well: cities that invest in public transit often see shrinking unemployment rates, because people have access to job opportunities that may have been off-limits before.

Americans aren’t just taking public transit more often, however. They’re also driving less, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The report found that the amount of miles driven per person has dropped in 46 states since 2007, with Washington, D.C. residents driving the least and young people across the country driving less than older generations.

If this trend of fewer miles driven and more miles spent on a bus or subway continues, it won’t just be good for the environment — it’ll also be good for Americans’ health. Multiple studies have linked air pollution exposure to heart damage and birth defects, and exposure to traffic pollution in particular could be linked to kidney damage.###3329||Empty###3330||Bitcoin trader Mt.

Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing that China’s ambassador to Malaysia met Malaysia’s foreign minister on Monday.

No trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.

Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

“Of course search and rescue efforts have become even harder now, and the area is much bigger,” Hong said. “We hope that Malaysia can provide more thorough, accurate information to countries participating.”

Hong declined to comment when asked if China is checking into the backgrounds of the Chinese passengers on board in search of suspicious histories. He declined to say whether China is searching over Tibet and the western region of Xinjiang for the jet, or whether China has ruled out that the plane entered its airspace.

About two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese.

Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course.###3333||Empty###3334||Empty###3335||In her first meeting as Federal Reserve chair next week, Janet Yellen will put her stamp on policy by reaching for a favorite tool of central bankers: words intended to guide markets in the direction policy makers want.

For more than a year, the Fed has kept monetary policy easy with assurances that its main interest rate won’t rise at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is no more than 2.5 percent. That guidance is almost obsolete: while unemployment is forecast to fall below the threshold this year, most Fed officials don’t foresee a rate increase until 2015.

Yellen’s challenge is to replace the threshold with guidance that’s less specific while also making it clear that rates won’t rise any time soon. If the Fed retreats to language that investors find vague and economic data comes in strong, traders are likely to move forward their estimate of when the central bank will raise rates, creating volatility in financial markets.

“Getting rid of the thresholds requires the committee to do something to keep the market in place,” said Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now senior managing director at forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington. “It is going to be quite volatile out there. What they are trying to do is prevent the markets from pushing up the timing of the rate increases.”

Junk Bonds

Volatility on interest rates of less than two years could have an impact on borrowing costs across the economy, especially on transactions where long-term debt is financed with short-term borrowing.

The Fed’s interest-rate thresholds have helped lower financing costs for companies whose bonds are rated below investment grade, or less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service or BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.

Yields on speculative-grade bonds have shrunk to within 3.82 percentage points of U.S. government securities on average, down from 5.29 percentage points when the Fed put the thresholds in place on Dec. 12, 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.

Analysts at Barclays Plc studied the market for two-year forward rates on two-year swap yields to measure the impact of expectations for changes in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, or the overnight rate for loans between banks.

Unemployment Forecasts

The analysis shows that volatility, or the expected size and frequency of interest-rate moves, remained low after the Fed put the thresholds in place and began to rise as unemployment fell closer to the Fed’s 6.5 percent goal.

“Less forward guidance could mean more uncertainty” about the path of the Fed’s benchmark rate, said Michael Gapen, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays in New York. “If it is volatility because we don’t understand their reaction-function, then that is not good.”

Unemployment was 6.7 percent in February, and the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a decline to 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in January from a year earlier, according to a measure watched by the Fed.

“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp” the Fed’s post-meeting statement “to take out that 6.5 percent threshold,” New York Fed President William C. Dudley, who also serves as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, said March 6 at an event in New York.

Carney’s Example

Fed President Charles Plosser called the threshold “obsolete” in a Feb. 28 interview.

The Bank of England offers one example the Fed could follow. The central bank refocused its interest-rate policy on spare capacity and a range of other indicators last month after unemployment fell faster than forecast toward the 7 percent threshold it set for considering a rate increase.

“Forward guidance is working,” BOE Governor Mark Carney said at his Feb. 12 press conference. “Expected interest rates have remained low even as the economy has recovered strongly. Uncertainty about interest rates has fallen.”

Three-month volatility for the pound versus the U.S. dollar fell to 6.17 percent on March 11, the lowest level since January 2013. It slid from last year’s high of 9.42 percent in July, before forward guidance was introduced.

Dudley called the BOE’s new guidance a “very good approach.”

Bond Purchases

“It was qualitative rather than quantitative,” he said March 6. “I think that is appropriate in the U.S. We are going to have to look at a broad set of labor-market conditions rather than one single indicator.”

Yellen and the FOMC can reach for other tools to guide markets on the outlook for the short-term rate.

The Fed could point to its bond-purchase program, which it is trimming at a pace of $10 billion per meeting. With the current pace of purchases at $65 billion a month and seven meetings left in 2014, the Fed won’t stop buying bonds until the fourth quarter.

Any increase in the short-term rate can be ruled out as long as bond purchases continue, because the Fed wouldn’t tighten policy with one tool while easing with another, said Michael Hanson, a former Fed economist who is now senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York.

“It’s going to be very difficult for them to think about raising rates before concluding the taper,” Hanson said, “so hiking this year is extremely unlikely.”

Hiring Plans

Yellen could also use her first post-meeting press conference to highlight a broader set of labor-market indicators. During testimony to Congress last month, she said the Fed must consider “more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.”

Minutes from the January FOMC meeting show the Fed staff watching measures of long-term unemployment, the share of workers employed part-time for economic reasons, and firms’ hiring plans for indications of labor-market slack.

The Fed could also rely more on policy makers’ quarterly forecasts for unemployment, growth, inflation and the path of the Fed’s target rate. The Fed will publish updated forecasts after next week’s meeting. In December, 15 out of 17 policy makers said the Fed wouldn’t raise rates until 2015 or later as the economy recovers slowly from the worst recession since the Great Depression.

The Fed can’t “avoid a certain amount of volatility” in short term rates as Yellen tries to pull back from the most explicit guidance in the 20-year history of the Fed’s post-meeting statements, said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas in New York.

“Their communication is going to have to be frequent, repeated, and clear, and they are going to be battling to hold the market back and prevent it from getting ahead of them,” she said. “That is part of this transition.”###3336||Empty###3337||Empty###3338||Empty###3339||The BoE's sharp shock to monetary illusions

A couple of weeks ago I took a swipe at Bank of England over a speech by its Governor Mark Carney that was unrealistic about the dangers of a bloated financial sector (Godzilla is good for you? March 3). Today I’m doing the opposite: I’m doffing my cap to the researchers at Threadneedle Street for a new paper “Money creation in the modern economy,” which gives a truly realistic explanation of how money is created, why this really matters, and why virtually everything that economic textbooks say about money is wrong.

The bank is going gangbusters to get its message across, with an introductory paper on what money is, and two short videos on what money is and money creation, both shot in its gold vault. It clearly wants economic textbooks to throw out the neat, plausible but wrong rubbish they currently teach about money, and connect with the real world instead.

Economic textbooks teach students that money creation is a two-stage process. At the start, banks can’t lend because of a rule called the “Required Reserve Ratio” that specifies a ratio between their deposits and their reserves. If they’re required to hold 10 cents in reserves to back every dollar in deposits, then if deposits are $10 trillion and reserves are $1 trillion, the banking sector can’t lend any money to anyone.

Stage one in the textbook money creation model is that the Fed (or the Bank of England) gives the banks additional reserves -- say $100 billion worth. Then in stage two, the banks lend this to their customers, who then deposit it right back into banks, who hang on to 10 per cent of it ($10 billion) and lend the remaining $90 billion out again. This process iterates until an additional $1 trillion of deposits are created, so that the reserve ratio is restored ($1.1 trillion in reserves, $11 trillion in deposits).

That model goes by the name of “Fractional Reserve Banking” (aka the “Money Multiplier”), and depending on your political persuasion it’s either outright fraud (If you’re of an Austrian persuasion like my mate Mish Shedlock) or just the way things are if you’re a mainstream economist like Paul Krugman. In the latter case, it lets conventional economists build models of the economy that completely ignore the existence of banks, and private debt, and in which the money supply is completely controlled by the Fed.

In this new paper, the Bank of England states emphatically that “Fractional Reserve Banking” is neither fraud, nor the way things are, but a myth -- and it rightly blames economic textbooks for perpetuating it. The paper doesn’t beat about the bush when it comes to the divergence between reality and what economic textbooks spout. In fact, as the paper explains it:

• Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits. (p. 1)

• In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money ‘multiplied up’ into more loans and deposits… (p. 1)

Rather than banks lending out deposits that are placed with them, the act of lending creates deposits — the reverse of the sequence typically described in textbooks… (p. 2)

While the money multiplier theory can be a useful way of introducing money and banking in economic textbooks, it is not an accurate description of how money is created in reality… (p. 2)

As with the relationship between deposits and loans, the relationship between reserves and loans typically operates in the reverse way to that described in some economics textbooks. (p. 2)

Now if I believed in the tooth fairy, I would hope this emphatic denunciation of the textbook model would cause macroeconomics lecturers to drastically revise their lectures for next week. But I’m too long in the tooth to have such a delusion. They’ll ignore it instead.

Their dominant “tactic” -- if I can call it that -- will be ignorance itself: most economics lecturers won’t even know that the bank’s paper exists, and they will continue to teach from whatever textbook bible they’ve chosen to inflict upon their students. A secondary one will be to know of it, but ignore it, as they’ve ignored countless critiques of mainstream economics before. The third arrow in the quill, if they are challenged by students about it (hint hint!), will be to argue that the textbook story is a “useful parable” for beginning students, and a more realistic vision is introduced in more advanced courses.

Here the Bank of England has unfortunately given them a useful “out”, by politely pretending that the money multiplier model “can be a useful way of introducing money and banking”. But of course this feint will be pure malarkey. Firstly, the model is utterly misleading -- it’s about as useful an introduction to the nature of money and banking as the Book of Genesis is an introduction to the theory of evolution. Once people believe the money multiplier model, they can rarely get their heads around the reality that bank lending creates money, and that this has drastic effects on the level of economic activity.

Secondly, the undergraduate lecturer’s “it gets better higher up” line is a ruse. Masters and PhD level courses continue to ignore banks, and though mainstream modellers are introducing all sorts of “financial frictions” into their DSGE models (as Noah Smith pointed out recently), none of them -- with the sterling exception of Michael Kumhof of the IMF -- are actually incorporating banks and their capacity to both create and destroy money into their models.

Why? Because if you admit the reality that banks create money by lending, and that money is destroyed by debt repayment (a point I have to admit that I took some time to appreciate), all the simple equilibrium parables of conventional economics fly out the window. In particular, the level of economic activity now depends on the lending decisions of banks (and the repayment decisions of borrowers). If banks lend more rapidly, or if borrowers repay more slowly, there will be a boom; if the reverse, there will be a slump. As the Bank of England puts it, if new loans simply make up for old ones being repaid, then there is no effect, but if new loans exceed repayment then aggregate demand will increase.

“There are two main possibilities for what could happen to newly created deposits,” the bank says. “First, as suggested by Tobin, the money may quickly be destroyed if the households or companies receiving the money after the loan is spent wish to use it to repay their own outstanding bank loans…

“The second possible outcome is that the extra money creation by banks can lead to more spending in the economy (p. 7).”

So from a realistic, hands-on perspective, the Bank of England declares that money matters in macroeconomics because it affects the level of economic activity. This really shouldn’t be a big deal -- it’s what most people actually believe anyway -- but incredibly, mainstream economics pretends that money only affects prices, that it has no impact (or only temporary one) on real activity, and that monetary disturbances are all the fault of the government (read central bank) anyway, because a quintessential market institution like a bank couldn’t do anything wrong, could it?

Leading economists can’t just ignore this paper, or blithely dismiss it as the foot-soldiers of the profession will do. But I seriously doubt that they will let it challenge their current position.

I will in particular be curious to see whether Paul Krugman notes this paper, and how he reacts to it. Krugman has been the most visible and aggressive defender of the proposition that banks don’t matter, with this including throwing a haymaker at me for making the case that the Bank of England is now making.

“In particular, he [Keen] asserts that putting banks in the story is essential,” Krugman wrote in 2012. “Now, I'm all for including the banking sector in stories where it's relevant; but why is it so crucial to a story about debt and leverage?

“Keen says that it's because once you include banks, lending increases the money supply. OK, but why does that matter? He seems to assume that aggregate demand can't increase unless the money supply rises, but that's only true if the velocity of money is fixed; so have we suddenly become strict monetarists while I wasn't looking? In the kind of model Gauti and I use, lending very much can and does increase aggregate demand, so what is the problem?”

Since then Krugman has continued to press the belief that banks are “mere intermediaries” in lending, that they can be ignored in macroeconomics.

“Yes, commercial banks, unlike other financial intermediaries, can make a loan simply by crediting the borrower with new deposits, but there’s no guarantee that the funds stay there,” he said in the article Commercial Banks As Creators of “Money”.

And in the same piece he wrote: “Banks are just another kind of financial intermediary, and the size of the banking sector — and hence the quantity of outside money — is determined by the same kinds of considerations that determine the size of, say, the mutual fund industry.”

Now that he has been directly contradicted on these points, not by some Antipodean heterodox economist, but by Threadneedle Street itself, I expect Krugman’s riposte will be the KISS principle: that while the “loans create deposits” argument is technically true, it doesn’t make any real difference to macroeconomics.

After all, Krugman certainly can’t just dismiss the Bank of England as being staffed by “Banking Mystics”, as he has brushed off the contrary views of others.

The S&P 500 also had a modest gain, up 0.03%, but the Dow fell 0.07%. Weakness was attributed to concerns over China’s economy and tensions between Russia and the West over the future of Ukraine.

General Motors (GM) fell 0.91% on news that government regulators would investigate complaints about faulty ignition switches.

The only economic report of interest was the weekly MBA Mortgage Index, which fell 2.1%. This followed last week’s increase of 9.4%.

At Wednesday’s close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11 points to 16,340, the S&P 500 was up less than 1 point to 1,868, and the Nasdaq was up 16 points at 4,323. The NYSE’s primary market traded 658 million shares with total volume of 3.2 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.1 billion shares. Advancers outpaced decliners on both major exchanges by about 1.2-to-1.

The Dow industrials are slowing following Friday’s attempt to break out. Immediate support is at the 20-day moving average at 16,234 and the 50-day at 16,167. And the support zone at 15,720 to 16,175 should hold back any serious attempt by the bears to turn the trend down.

The Dow transports look much like the industrials. However, that bull channel with support at the conjunction of the 20-day and 50-day moving averages at under 7,400 is an important barrier to the bears.

Conclusion: The bulls would feel more secure if only the Dow industrials and the transports would break out together and render a new Dow Theory buy signal. Eventually we should see a breakout, but trading has been slow, and selling pressure has been light.

Even though volume has been especially light on the downside, and our internal indicators are all positive, a modest pullback to the major moving averages is possible. If we get it, buyers will probably jump on their favorites, so be prepared to buy yours at your predetermined prices. For a year, pullbacks have been quickly reversed, and so Good-Til-Cancelled (GTC) limit orders should be placed on stocks you want to buy.

The president's former lawyer on Friday made his first on-camera remarks since pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and saying he broke these laws at Trump's direction. His message? Vote against Republicans, and his former boss, in the midterm elections. Cohen told CNN that Americans should get to the polls this November, because "if not, you are going to have another two or another six years of this craziness."

Cohen changed his party registration from Republican to Democrat last week, just a few months after he left his post as the deputy finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. At the time, Cohen's lawyer said this was another example of him "distancing himself from the values" of the White House, and from the man who retained his legal services for 12 years. On Friday, Cohen said that he has really always been a Democrat at heart, and only briefly changed his party registration to Republican so he could work for the RNC.

CNN also reports that Cohen is prepared to stump for Democrats this November and in 2020 — although, considering Cohen will be sentenced on eight criminal charges this December, it seems unlikely anyone will take him up on that offer. Watch Cohen's comments below. Brendan Morrow###3342||Empty###3343||As investigators continue to analyze the evidence, the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines jet has deepened, from Australia to Khazakstan.

There is growing evidence Malaysia Flight 370's disappearance was no accident and the plane deliberately diverted.

"There's two possible trajectories here. One southward into the Indian Ocean and one more northward toward Western China, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan," Erik Stakelbeck, CBN's Terror Analyst said.

CBN News Terror Analyst Erik Stakelbeck discusses the indications of the strange Malaysian jet disappearance on "The 700 Club," March 17.

Investigators haven't ruled out hijacking, sabotage, pilot suicide, or mass murder. They are also checking the backgrounds of all passengers and crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems, or psychological issues could be factors.

Most of the suspicion has fallen on the pilots because of their aviation experience. Investigators are focusing in on their personal lives.

Authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was deliberately diverted and its communications equipment switched off. It doesn't appear anyone on board had the skills to perform the sophisticated maneuvering that marked the plane's mysterious midnight run, including a pre-programmed hard left turn.

"I think it is pretty outrageous that it took Malaysian government about a week to search the pilots' homes and start investigating them and the crew and the passengers," Stackelbeck said.

The data transmission system was also turned off and the location transmission cut. Experts said there is only one goal in intentionally shutting off those systems: to make it very difficult to find the aircraft.

In addition, someone radioed in the cockpit "all right good night."

"The pilot and co-pilot should have been the focus from the start. That would be ordinary law enforcement, investigatory procedures," Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said.

"The FBI could have been called to help that," he continued. "Interpol could have been called in, our intelligence agencies. But my understanding is that Malaysia is not really cooperating at all (and) are very reluctant to lay what they have out on the table."

There have been reports that the pilot, Capt. Zahairi Ahmad Shah, was an ardent follower of a Malaysian opposition leader, sentenced to prison the very day of the ill-fated flight. The co-pilot has also previously broken safety standards in the cockpit.

At the home of Capt. Shah, police confiscated two laptops and his home flight simulator, seen in a YouTube video he posted.

"I can't imagine him doing anything to hurt himself, passengers, the property," Chris Nissen, Shah's friend said.

Still, there are reports the men did not ask for any extra fuel for the flight, and they made no special request to fly together. Investigators said that makes the idea of a conspiracy between the two appear less likely.

U.S. officials say the plane most likely ran out of fuel in the South Indian Ocean where Australia is now coordinating the search.

Twenty-six countries are looking for the plane. The United States has sent a P-8A Poseidon, the most advanced long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world, to search the Indian Ocean.

The U.S. Navy also has deployed the destroyer USS Kidd.###3344||Beijing: Malaysia must "immediately" expand and clarify the scope of the search for a Malaysia Airlines jetliner that disappeared with 239 people on board, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday in a statement posted on its website.

Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing that China`s ambassador to Malaysia met Malaysia`s foreign minister on Monday.

No trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.

Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

"Of course search and rescue efforts have become even harder now, and the area is much bigger," Hong said. "We hope that Malaysia can provide more thorough, accurate information to countries participating."

Hong declined to comment when asked if China is checking into the backgrounds of the Chinese passengers on board in search of suspicious histories. He declined to say whether China is searching over Tibet and the western region of Xinjiang for the jet, or whether China has ruled out that the plane entered its airspace.

About two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese.

Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course.###3345||NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Trading firm Virtu Financial Inc, which posted only one day of trading losses over the five years ended 2013, plans to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

Virtu said the IPO price was an estimate solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company, a market maker in equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities markets, intends to list Class A shares on Nasdaq under the symbol “VIRT.” Virtu will have three other share classes.

Goldman Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan, Sandler O’Neill + Partners LP are the underwriters for the offering, among others.

Vincent Viola, Virtu’s founder and executive chairman, will control more than a majority of the combined voting power of the company’s common stock after the offering.

Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which acquired its stake in 2011, is the other major shareholder.

Last year the company paid out $433.4 million in cash distributions to members.

Virtu said as a result of its real-time risk management strategy and technology, the company had only one losing day of trading from the beginning of 2009 through the end of 2013, a total of 1,238 trading days.

Virtu reported a net income of $182.2 million on a revenue of $623.7 million last year, an increase from earnings of $87.6 million on $581.5 million in revenue in 2012.

Virtu employs a “market neutral” strategy in which it is not dependent on the direction of any particular market. The firm aims to lock in returns through “precise and nearly instantaneous hedging,” the company said.

Virtu said it expected global electronic trading to continue to grow, after experiencing a compound annual rate of 13.7 percent over the past decade, according to the World Federation of Exchanges.###3346||Following the MtGox Bitcoin exchange losing millions to a hack and filing for bankruptcy, anonymous attackers took over the personal blog and reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday. After seizing control, the hackers posted (Pastebin) a message to the two spaces detailing their findings and the reasoning behind the attack.

"It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities [sic] wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," the message reads. "This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data... Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included."

Forbes reports the 716 megabyte file placed on Karpeles' site included items like his home address, CV, and an Excel spreadsheet that seems to document more than a million trades. But the most interesting piece of information shared is a summary of 18 different currency balances—with 951,116 bitcoins listed. In light of the 850,000 bitcoins supposedly lost in the recent attack, the hackers concluded this figure demonstrates fraud. The footnote reads, "That fat fuck has been lying!!"

Despite the hack making noise around the Internet today, this leak is not yet guaranteed evidence of foul play. As Forbes notes, the balances could be a case of awful bookkeeping (it's not too far-fetched that MtGox was unaware of the hack for a while), and Karpeles has yet to return that site's request for comment.###3347||Vodafone will buy the Spanish cable company Ono for £6 billion, including debt. Ono has the largest next-generation network in Spain, passing 7.2 million homes and serving 1.9 million customers across the country. Ono has 790,000 digital television customers, 320,000 of which have TiVo.



Vodafone will refocus its own fibre network rollout on areas where Ono has limited or no network presence, passing 1.5 million homes, giving it access to up to 10 million homes across Spain.

Telefónica, the incumbent national operator, has 670,000 digital television customers in Spain.

Vodafone Group chief executive Vittorio Colao said: “The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.”

José María Castellano Ríos, the chairman of Grupo Corporativo Ono, said: “As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect. The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry.”

The announcement ends plans for the private equity-backed Ono to list in Madrid.

This is the second acquisition by Vodafone in six months, having previously agreed to buy a controlling stake in the German cable company Kabel Deutschland for £6.6 billion.

There is renewed interest in mergers and acquisitions in the cable sector, driven by the adoption of broadband and the opportunities for converged communications services.

Vodafone has significant reserves to spend on strategic acquisitions, following the sale of its business in the United States for £77 billion.

Based in Britain, where it started as mobile network operator born out of Racal Electronics in 1982, Vodafone now has over 450 million customers worldwide.

Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told President Vladimir Putin on Monday Russia's position on Ukraine was at odds with the West, and that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had declined an invitation to visit Russia for further talks.

Russian news agency Interfax earlier quoted a Ukrainian base commander as saying Russian troops opened fire during the takeover of a Ukrainian military post in Crimea.

U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled $3.30 higher at $1,341.50 an ounce. Spot gold was flat at $1,340 an ounce.

"Stock market weakness and gold strength this afternoon seem to stem back to the news from Crimea about shots being fired," Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen said. "It highlights the nervousness about what can happen."###3349||Why did this happen?

The scene was the annual press conference with China’s Premier Li Keqiang at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. Actually, the words “press conference” make the session that closes the National People’s Congress sound like a spontaneous event. Rest assured that the Q&A with the Chinese Premier is a meticulously scripted affair.

The journalists chosen to ask questions on the morning of March 13 were contacted beforehand. There’s negotiation — at least from some foreign reporters — about exactly how the queries will be phrased. But there are to be no surprises at the triumphal end of China’s annual legislative session. This pre-screening ensures that the Premier somehow has all the right facts and figures available to respond in great detail. There are even ringers brought in who are instructed to raise their hands with great enthusiasm. As Li slogged through his answers, journalists took bets on how long it would take for the news-making moment to arrive.

Li uttered disquisitions on the mystery surrounding Malaysia Airline Flight 370, which disappeared without a trace on March 8 with 153 Chinese passengers on board (Li: “families and friends [of passengers] are burning with anxiety” and “as long as there is a glimmer of hope,” China will not halt its search for the missing airliner) and the greatest challenge for China last year (Li: “increased downward pressure on China’s economic growth”). He vowed that “we need to loosen the straightjacket on businesses” and mentioned the hot term “rule of law” a couple times. Li acknowledged the severity of China’s air pollution problem, guaranteeing “a war on our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life” and noting that the first thing many Chinese do upon waking is to check pollution-index aps on their cellphones.

But the question in question never came. For months now, a dragnet has appeared to tighten around Zhou Yongkang, who oversaw China’s massive surveillance state until his retirement in late 2012. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li, China has launched an anti-corruption crackdown that has netted hundreds of wayward officials. President Xi has promised to nab both lowly “flies” and high-ranking “tigers.” If Zhou, he of the Mafioso slicked-back hair and steely gaze, is indeed probed, he would be the mightiest tiger to be felled in decades. After all, he was a member of China’s elite ruling circle: the then nine (now seven) men of the party’s Standing Committee who determine the course of the People’s Republic.

Over the past year, a slew of officials high and low who worked under Zhou in three main spheres — the state-owned oil industry, the populous province of Sichuan and the Public Security Ministry — have been detained. His son and top aides have been implicated in nefarious financial dealings. Zhou himself may be under house arrest. All of which led some China-watchers to expect that Premier Li would use a pre-approved question at his press conference to at least indirectly refer to the state’s possible case against Zhou.

Li did not. In an annual press conference remarkably devoid of actual news, the Premier did take on a question about corruption; it was the third one asked of him and was lobbed Li’s way by a reporter from the online arm of People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s mouthpiece. Li’s voice took on a stern tone as he swore “zero tolerance” for corrupt cadres. He vowed that no matter “how senior his position is [corrupt officials] will be severely dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law.” Li promised that “everyone is equal before the law.” But, despite the People’s Daily reporter asking specifically whether there was anything systemic that could be changed, Li declined to tout an easy tool to combat corruption among party ranks: asset disclosure. Granted, releasing such financial information is a rather touchy subject in a political culture where profiting from power is almost expected.

More importantly, no names — certainly not Zhou’s — were named. Two years ago, at the final press conference by outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao, he launched a not-so-oblique attack on Bo Xilai, the former party chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing and an aspirant to the Standing Committee. One day after Wen’s press conference, the Bo purge began. It was a dramatic downfall that involved a poisoned British businessman, a murderous wife and a cache of absconded public funds. Bo’s case turned into China’s biggest political scandal in decades. (Zhou was considered to have been Bo’s political patron.)

As the minutes ticked by in Li’s presser, expectations rose. After all, former Premier Wen had dispatched his tirade aimed at Bo toward the end of his press conference. Before answering his penultimate question, Li noted that it was time for lunch. Journalists must be hungry. A question followed on China’s trading relations with Europe — specifically to do with high-speed rails, nuclear power and solar panels. Then came the last question, the subject of which I’ve frankly forgotten. Suffice it to say it was not about Mr. Zhou. Reporters were dismissed for lunch.

On Weibo, China’s lively although occasionally censored microblogging service, people digested the press conference. One popular strain of commentary wondered why no mention had been made of Zhou. Wrote one Weibo user: “I’m very puzzled, why did the journalists, especially the foreign journalists, not cherish their opportunity to ask questions? Don’t they know Master Kang is the most delicious one?” (Zhou’s name is blocked on Weibo searches so Chinese online use creative nicknames like Master Kang to evade the state censors.) Apparently the Weibo commenters were not aware of the scripted ritual. In fact, in a meeting with a senior Chinese official some weeks back, some of us in the foreign press community had already been warned that a question on Zhou was verboten.

Meanwhile, the day before Li’s press conference began, a bloodied man was found dead in the stairwell of a securities’ firm off Beijing’s Financial Street, one of the Chinese capital’s business areas. Police said the man had ended his own life with a knife. His will was discovered. The dead man, according to Chinese media reports, is related to a former secretary to a senior leader currently under investigation. The Chinese press did not name the disgraced politician but he appears to be none other than Zhou Yongkang.

—with reporting by Gu Yongqiang/Beijing###3351||Empty###3352||Students at a UK university campus based in Malaysia have been urged to help hunt for the missing plane, which disappeared almost a week ago.

Geography students at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC) have been given the opportunity to join in the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370.

Using the latest crowd-sourcing techniques for satellite image interpretation they will be able to join volunteers across the globe in the search for the missing aircraft.

Geospatial scientist Dr Tuong-Thuy Vu, a professor at the university, is an expert in disaster responses and crowd-sourcing.

HE says: “Earth Observation satellite platforms play an important role in every aspect of our life. They capture frequent and up to date images everywhere on Earth with the very latest synoptic views — up to 0.5 m resolution — of the Earth surface.

"In the area of emergency and post-disaster responses it is sometimes the sole data source when accessibility on the ground becomes impossible. As the search for flight MH370 enters its sixth day with ships, aircraft and helicopters, Earth observation satellite platforms have been deployed as another option.”

Dr Vu, who is working with international organisation DigitalGlobe to help search, has asked his students at UNMC if they will be willing to participate in the hunt.

The company is working with volunteers, who have been assigned a collection of satellite images to scour, in the hope of pinpointing any clues or wreckage.

Dr Vu adds: “I have looked at 40 tiles [images] so far, but no news yet. I also informed students today and asked if they want to participate. I also hope that satellite images of more extended area will be soon available.”

The mystery surrounding the missing Malaysia Airlines passenger plane deepened on Thursday morning after the Malaysian Transport Minister robustly dismissed a number of reports.

Officials confirmed they still know nothing, with a press conference this morning ending with lots of denials, little new information and still no sign of the plane.

There was yet another dramatic twist as Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein denied reports the missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet may have flown for four hours, escalating the confusion over what is already one of the most baffling mysteries in modern aviation history.###3353||Empty###3354||CHINA and its neighbours are capable of producing "sounds of harmony" instead of "jarring noises", if all sides observe mutual respect and pursue shared interests, said Premier Li Keqiang.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another," he said on Thursday morning at a press conference wrapping up the annual National People's Congress session.

"As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises."

Mr Li was asked about how he saw the development of China's ties with its neighbours amid ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea with four Asean countries and Taiwan, and in the East China sea over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands with Japan.

He said that China's philosophy on relations with its neighbours adheres to the 1953 "five principles of peaceful co-existence" mooted by late premier Zhou Enlai: mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence.

Also, China needs a stable and peaceful external environment to continue on its developmental path, he noted, adding that he believes peace in the region is what all the citizens of the countries involved want.

He once went to Vietnam and visited a small shop incognito at night after the official programme, he said. When he asked the female shopkeeper how she saw ties between their countries, she replied that it would be best to be peaceful and friendly.

"This is what the people want and I think we should work hard to expand areas of mutual benefit and minimise areas of differences."

Mr Li also emphasised repeatedly the philosophy of minimising differences and maximising mutual benefit when later asked about China's relationship with the United States and with Europe respectively.

While China and the US have different histories, cultures and stages of development, managing their differences on an equal basis, and expanding areas of common interest and benefit, would bring ties to a new height, he said.

rchang@sph.com.sg###3355||BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Furious relatives of passengers on a missing Malaysia aircraft are ramping up pressure on the Malaysian and Chinese governments to give them answers about what has happened, threatening lawsuits and demanding to see Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Surrounded by reporters who have flocked to the nondescript Beijing hotel where they have been told by the airline to gather, relatives are lashing out at the media, the airline and their own government for ignoring their plight.

“I really want to see President Xi - I don’t know right now what could possibly be more important than the lives of these 200 people,” said a young woman who gave her family name as Wen, fighting back tears.

“I also want to ask Mrs Xi, if your husband, President Xi, was on the plane, just imagine, if it was you, how would your parents feel?

“My husband was on the plane, every day my children are asking me about their dad, what am I supposed to do? ... We’re helpless, we need our government to support us.”

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur early on Saturday and dropped off civilian radar screens less than an hour into its flight to Beijing, a mystery that has yet to be solved.

Another person, who declined to give his name, said a lawsuit was the only way forward.

“We are definitely going sue them. This is really bad. (We are not suing) Malaysia Airlines, but the Malaysian government,” he told reporters.

One man from Beijing, speaking to reporters after a meeting between the families and Malaysian diplomats, said it was ridiculous the Malaysians seemed to have no information about even the most basic facts.

“The exact demands were the exact position the plane disappeared at, the time it disappeared, and what happened in the time between the time when the plane was first reported missing and 2.40,” he said, recounting the meeting on Thursday with the diplomats, who left without speaking to reporters.

Malaysia Airlines, the Malaysian and Chinese governments say they are doing all they can for the relatives, though Beijing has demanded Kuala Lumpur drastically step up its efforts.

Hugh Dunleavy, Malaysia Airlines’ commercial director, told Reuters on Wednesday they were having a problem with some people who were turning up at the hotel and claiming free meals and rooms when they had nothing to do with the flight.

“I’m trying to get that organised with the family members, to say, let’s take a real look at this, because they’re complaining that they don’t want them in there,” he said.

The loss of a relative threatens to cause real difficulty for some of the families left behind.

Feng Zhishan, 50, said his son Feng Dong, 22, was flying back to China via Kuala Lumpur from Singapore, where he had been working on building a new subway line.

“Our family has no money,” Feng told Reuters. “They all said, you can make more money in Singapore.”

Another man, who refused to give his name, said his cousin was on the flight, having transited in Kuala Lumpur on his way home from a business trip in Australia.

“He’s a really outgoing guy, loves travelling and sports. He was just 27 this year, and with a six month old son,” he said, visibly distressed.

“It’s been more than 70 hours. By now their officials should have given us some kind of explanation.”

Paul Yin, a U.S.-trained psychologist, said he was at the hotel to offer counselling services.

“They go through ups and downs every day. Some are even suicidal,” he said.

“Chinese society is based on the family unit. Especially with the one-child policy, if your kids are gone... for many people their purpose in life is circled around the next generation, and if they’re gone some people don’t see a purpose in being around any more.”###3356||China to raise urban residents to 60 pct by 2020

BEIJING -- China will build more railways and increase the number of small and medium-sized cities as it seeks to raise the proportion of urban residents in the population, which it sees as the country's next big engine for economic growth.

The plans are contained in a 2014-2020 urbanization document unveiled Sunday by the State Council, China's Cabinet, that was reported by the official Xinhua News Agency.

The plan says rural residents employed in cities will see their incomes rise, increasing consumption, while investment in urban infrastructure, public service facilities and housing will drive economic development.

At present, permanent urban residents make up 53.7 percent of the population of almost 1.4 billion. China plans to raise this to 60 percent of the total population by 2020 -- on a par with that of developing countries with similar per capita income levels as China and lower than the average of 80 percent for developed countries.

Xinhua said the plan states that regular railways will cover cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020 and high-speed railways with connect those with more than half a million residents.

China's urbanization first picked up pace with market reforms in the early 1980s. By 2011, half the country's population had moved into cities. However, a rigid, decades-old household registration system that assigns either urban or rural status under the old planned economy means tens of millions of migrants officially remain residents of their rural hometowns and have limited education, health and pension benefits in the cities, fueling discontent nationwide.

Xinhua said only 35.7 percent of the country's people had urban status by the end of last year and the full claims to public urban services that this entails. It said the plan calls for residents with city status to account for about 45 percent of the total population by 2020.###3357||What’s motivating Torontonians to vote — or not — on Oct. 22 (and it’s not the ward fiasco)

King.com, which has headquarters in London and Stockholm, announced last month that it had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker KING.

In an updated filing with the Security and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, King.com said it expects to prices its shares at between $21 and $24.

Selling 1.5.5 million shares in the offering - along with a further 6.7 million shares from investors - this would value the company at as much as $7.56bn.

The IPO will see the company raise as much as $533 million at the top-end of the predicted range, slightly higher than the $500m placeholder figure it filed for last month.

Registered in Ireland

King was founded in Stockholm over a decade ago as Midasplayer Ltd. It rebranded as King.com in 2004 and currently has nine studios around the world. While its main headquarters are in London and Stockholm, as of last July the company is registered in Ireland, in a move which echoes many major technology companies - a move King said at the time was "intended to provide us worldwide tax efficiencies."

The games developer didn't hit the big time until it launched Candy Crush Saga as a Facebook game in April 2012.

Since then the company's growth - and profitability - has skyrocketed.

For example, in 2012 the company recorded revenue of $164.4m and profit of $7.8m. Just a year later the company saw revenues of $1.88bn and profit of $567.6m.

One billion game plays daily

The growth is predominately based on the popularity of Candy Crush Saga which attracts 93 million players every day, combining to make more than one billion game plays daily. This one game alone generates 78% of King's revenue.

However, King is not a one-trick pony - four other games also rack up millions of gamers every day. Pet Rescue Saga attracts 15 million daily players, while Farm Heroes sees eight million, Papa Pear five million and Bubble Witch three million.

In the initial IPO filing, CEO Riccardo Zacconi explained his company's business model of producing games quickly to see what works and what doesn't.

"Our approach to development is to keep things simple – not just the gameplay, but also the process. We create many games, then launch them on our website to see what works and what does not. It's a continuous cycle of innovation and improvement, trying out new ideas, revising them, and trying again.

"Even for our most established games that are on social and mobile platforms, we continue to add new levels, new twists and new experiences to keep them fun and fresh. We work for our players and incessantly try to improve what we do; we give all we have to make the best games for them."###3361||Empty###3362||Empty###3363||China deployed 21 satellites to scour its territory for a missing Malaysian jetliner, while Australia said it had drastically narrowed its sector of the search area but was still looking in an expanse of ocean the size of Spain and Portugal.

The major averages have all moved to the downside, although selling pressure has remained relatively subdued.

The early weakness on Wall Street comes on the heels of the release of disappointing Chinese trade data, with a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.

The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.

Nonetheless, trading activity on Wall Street has remained somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Steel stocks have moved sharply lower, however, with worries about the outlook for Chinese demand weighing on the sector. The NYSE Arca Steel Index has fallen by 2.2 percent, hitting a five-month intraday low.

Gold, housing and defense stocks are also seeing early weakness, while most of the other major sectors are showing only modest moves.

The major averages are currently posting modest losses, near their lows for the young session. The Dow is down 66.73 points or 0.4 percent at 16,385.99, the Nasdaq is down 6.95 points or 0.2 percent at 4,329.27 and the S&P 500 is down 4.19 points or 0.2 percent at 1,873.85.

Market Analysis###3367||###3368||Empty###3369||(PHOTO: Associated Press)

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said recovery in developed economies is on track although slowing activity in big emerging markets means global growth will be only moderate at best in the near term.

Exceptionally bad winter weather in North America and a sales tax hike in Japan are also disrupting the pace of recovery, the Paris-based think-tank said on Tuesday.

Against that backdrop, the OECD urged the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to keep up their monetary stimulus, if not increase it, while it said the US Federal Reserve was right to begin winding down its bond-buying programme.

"The gradual recovery in the advanced economies is encouraging, even if temporary factors have pushed down growth rates in the early months of this year, while the slowdown in emerging economies is likely to be a drag on global growth," OECD acting chief economist Rintaro Tamaki said in a statement.

Growth for major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be slower than in the second half of 2013, but much improved from the sluggish rates of late 2012 and early 2013, the OECD said in an update of its views on the global economy.

"Given that emerging economies now account for over half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major EMEs (emerging market economies) is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term," the OECD said.

It estimated growth in the United States would slow to 1.7 per cent in the first quarter from the previous three months on an annualised basis, down from 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter when exceptionally bad weather weighed on activity.

Japanese growth would surge 4.8 per cent in the first quarter from the previous quarter as consumers brought forward purchases ahead of a sales tax increase on April 1.

The OECD gave its updated forecasts as part of an interim health-check for the global economy before its much more detailed Economic Outlook due in May. It did not update its estimates for US and Japanese growth in the second quarter because one-off factors made it too problematic, it said.

Turning to Europe, the OECD saw Germany's quarter-on-quarter annualised growth rate reaching 3.7 per cent in the first quarter before slowing to 2.5 per cent.

France, the euro zone's second biggest economy after Germany, was seen growing only 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year, rising to 1 per cent in the second quarter.

Outside the euro zone, the British economy was seen growing 3.3 per cent in both the first and second quarters.

Turning to emerging market economies, the OECD said some were seeing a marked loss of momentum as capital outflows exposed vulnerabilities in some countries.

It noted that Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey among others have been forced to raise interest rates to keep capital outflows in check. Meanwhile, weak balance sheets in China raised the risk of a sharp slowdown there, the OECD said.

(Reuters)###3370||The Libyan parliament has this afternoon voted out Ali Zeidan's government over its inability to control rebels in the eastern part of the country.

The General National Assembly approved a no-confidence motion to oust Zeidan amid anger at his government's failure to stop eastern rebels from independently exporting oil. Zeidan has been replaced by the defence minister.

The vote on Tuesday came hours after an oil tanker carrying rebel oil escaped warships and left the country.

MP Suleiman al-Zubi told the AFP news agency that Defence Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was named interim premier for the two weeks the assembly now has to agree on a permanent replacement.

"The Congress voted to withdraw its confidence in the prime minister by 124 votes," al-Zubi told AFP.

Zeidan's government had been repeatedly criticised for its failure to disarm militias which have carved out their own fiefdoms

since the NATO-backed uprising that ended the 42-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by an armed group in the heart of the capital, Tripoli, last October.

"The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," MP Suad Gannur told AFP before the assembly vote.

Earlier, a North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya escaped navy warships deployed to intercept it and is now in international waters, rebels and a state oil company official said.

The Morning Glory , which docked in al-Sidra port on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held port since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

"The tanker left and is now in international waters," Reuters quoted Mohammad Hitab, spokesman for the state-run al-Waha Oil Company operating the al-Sidra port, as saying.

Rebels demanding a bigger share of oil revenue and political autonomy in the east seized three ports last summer and partly control a fourth.

The central government had threatened armed action , even an air strike, to prevent the tanker from getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

Members of the General National Congress (GNC), Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.

Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

The tanker's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi.

In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel fighters have carved out their own fiefdoms.###3371||Empty###3372||Men's Wearhouse Inc (MW) Tuesday said its loss for the fourth quarter widened from a year ago, due mainly to the harsh winter that kept shoppers indoors as well as weak margins. The clothing retailer's results for the quarter missed Wall Street estimates as well.

Men's Wearhouse, which agreed to acquire smaller rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, said it expended on product promotions and that some momentum was seen in February. The retailer is also optimistic on product roll outs, with 'Made-in-America' Joseph Abboud set to hit stores.

Harsh winter weather across the U.S. has been a drag for retailers and other sectors, with the situation accentuated by weak consumer spending.

Houston, Texas-based Men's Wearhouse posted a fourth-quarter net loss to stockholders of $30.4 million or $0.64 per share, compared with a loss of $3.4 million or $0.07 per share last year.

Excluding items, adjusted loss for the quarter was $18 million or $0.38 per share versus a loss of $5 million or $0.10 per share in the prior year.

On average, six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss of $0.13 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude one-tine items.

Sales for the fourth quarter dropped 7.9 percent to $560.6 million from $608.4 million last year. Five analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $611.7 million for the quarter.

Comparable store sales at Men's Wearhouse brand fell 3 percent for the quarter, with smaller brands Moores and K&G also declining.

Gross margin for the quarter fell to 37.3 percent from about 40 percent a year ago, due partly to higher markdowns and deleveraging of occupancy costs. Selling and general expenses increased by $6 million to $256.5 million.

Earlier today, Men's Wearhouse agreed to acquire smaller rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (JOSB) for $1.8 billion, ending a protracted takeover tussle. The combined company will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., with around 23,000 employees and adjusted sales of $3.5 billion.

The merger comes five months after Jos. A. Bank offered to buy Men's Wearhouse for $2.3 billion. However, Men's Wearhouse spurned the bid and launched counter bids to buy Jos. A. Bank for $1.2 billion, which was then sweetened to about $1.6 billion. Last month, Men's Wearhouse raised its offer to about $1.78 billion.

The company's stock closed Tuesday at $57.14, up $2.57 or 4.71%, on a volume of 5.5 million shares on the NYSE. In after hours, the stock dropped $0.55 or 0.96%, at $56.59. In the past year, the stock has trended in the range of $28.95 - $58.80.

Business News###3373||Empty###3374||Cars being recalled to replace ignition switches include versions of the Chevrolet Cobalt, a line no longer made

US federal prosecutors are examining whether General Motors is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose ignition switch problems with some now out of production vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths and led to a recall last month, a source familiar with the investigation told a news agency.

The New York-based probe is in its early stages, and the source did not elaborate on the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability, Reuters reported.

The source said federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago.

GM declined to comment.

As just-auto reported on Tuesday, the federal probe by the US attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of US authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted fast enough with its recall.

Reuters reported earlier that a US Senate committee chairman, Michigan Republican Fred Upton, was seeking a hearing on the issue. The House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM's ignition switch problems by 25 March. Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tyre failures on Ford vehicles, resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA, the news agency noted. That law also makes it a crime to intentionally mislead the agency about defects that lead to serious accidents.

Meanwhile, ignition switch supplier Delphi Automotive said in a statement sent ot Reuters on Tuesday the part had not been provided to any other automaker.

The report noted the criminal probe of GM opened by Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara follows on from an investigation conducted by the same office into Toyota's disclosure in 2009 of driver complaints of unintended acceleration by some of its vehicles.

Toyota has been engaged in negotiations with Bharara's office to settle that probe, which is also criminal, a source familiar with the investigation had previously told Reuters.

The US Justice Department can only open a grand jury investigation into such allegations at the request of the Transportation Secretary, according to the law, Reuters noted.

"We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall," a Transportation Department spokesman told the news agency in a statement.

The person familiar with the criminal probe declined to discuss with Reuters whether prosecutors were considering liability under the TREAD Act.###3375||The chief executive of UniCredit has told CNBC the bank will focus on "growth and profitability" after reporting a record annual net loss of 14 billion euros ($19.4 billion) for 2013, largely due to massive writedowns.

Federico Ghizzoni said the bank's surprise balance-sheet clear-out came amid efforts to put the past behind it and look forward.



Despite the loss, shares in the bank rallied over 6 percent on Tuesday as investors welcomed the move by Italy's largest lender by assets. Sentiment was also boosted by the bank's ruling out of the need for a capital increase.

Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told President Vladimir Putin on Monday Russia's position on Ukraine was at odds with the West, and that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had declined an invitation to visit Russia for further talks.

Russian news agency Interfax earlier quoted a Ukrainian base commander as saying Russian troops opened fire during the takeover of a Ukrainian military post in Crimea.

Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,342.60 an ounce at 1214 GMT, while U.S. gold futures for April delivery were up $4.70 an ounce to $1,342.90.

"Stock market weakness and gold strength this afternoon seem to stem back to the news from Crimea about shots being fired," Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen said. "It highlights the nervousness about what can happen."

"Short-term traders in gold were playing it from the short side earlier today, so it's back to square one for many."

The precious metal fell as low as $1,328.86 in earlier trade, extending a 0.8 percent drop it made on Friday after U.S. payrolls data beat forecasts, suggesting the Federal Reserve's stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.

On the wider markets, European shares erased early gains to fall 0.7 percent after reports of renewed unrest in Ukraine.

Commodities in general sold off after a surprise fall in China's exports, with copper sinking to 8-1/2-month lows, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped.

China, the world's biggest consumer of many commodities including gold, said on Saturday its exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit.

Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices on Monday, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than $20 at the beginning of the year.

Two-way flows were evident in Asian gold trading overnight, MKS said in a report. "Once the Shanghai Gold Exchange opened some aggressive selling ensued, driving the price below $1,330," it said. "Once again retail bids below this level emerged and supported the market."

Investor sentiment towards gold has been positive this year after a 28 percent drop in prices in 2013.

Hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to the highest in more than a year, according to Friday data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, said its holdings rose 1.5 tonnes on Friday, its first inflow since February 25.

Among other precious metals, silver was flat at $20.88 an ounce.

The gold/silver ratio, which measures the number of silver ounces needed to buy an ounce of gold, hit a fresh five-week high at 64.4 as silver underperformed on Monday.

Spot platinum was down 0.2 percent at $1,475 an ounce, while spot palladium was down 0.9 percent at $772.40 an ounce.###3379||Empty###3380||DETROIT (AP) � General Motors faced more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars yesterday as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened probes into the matter.

The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter. The inquiry is being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.

Spokesmen for the Justice Department and GM would not comment. The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg News.

At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner.###3381||March 18 (Reuters) - Car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc said it would spin off its equipment rental business for $2.5 billion.

The company said it expects the separation, which will be through a tax-free distribution to shareholders, to close by early 2015.###3382||Empty###3383||Sources tell the Financial Times that Hertz (HTZ) is planning to separate its construction equipment rental business. The news sent HTZ stock up more than 5% in Monday morning trading.

According to the report, HTZ is considering a possible “Reverse Morris Trust,” under which HTZ would first spin off the construction equipment rental unit to HTZ shareholders and then merge it with another company. Such a deal would be tax-free if it the HTZ subsidiary is considered the buyer of the company with which it merges.

Hertz is said to be communicating with possible targets for a post-spin off merger.

During the first nine months of 2013, the equipment rental unit generated $1.1 billion in revenue. Other HTZ units reported revenue of $7.1 billion during the same period. The equipment rental business accounted for $207 million in earnings during that time.

Men's Wearhouse has agreed to buy Jos A Bank, ending a five-month long takeover battle between the two rivals.

It will pay $1.8bn (£1.1bn) in cash, or $65 per Jos A Bank share.

The combined entity will be the fourth-largest men's clothing retailer in the US with annual sales of nearly $3.5bn.

Jos A Bank had offered to buy its bigger rival last year. But that offer was rejected and Men's Wearhouse countered the move with a bid to acquire Jos A Bank.

The two firms agreed to enter talks after Men's Wearhouse raised it offer.

"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos A Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos A Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach," Doug Ewert, chief executive of Men's Wearhouse, said in a statement.

'Second Christmas' for shareholders

The price offered by Men's Wearhouse is a 56% premium to what Jos A Bank shares were trading at when the takeover battle between the two firms began in October last year.

Analysts said the deal was a good outcome for Jos A Bank's shareholders.

"A merger with Men's Wearhouse was always the likeliest of outcomes, it's just that Jos A Bank wanted to extract every penny from its suitor," said Brian Sozzi, chief executive of Belus Capital Advisors.

A third person close to the deal said Vivendi was expecting an improved offer from Bouygues before a deadline for bids tonight.

The two people said the improved bid could take the cash portion of Bouygues’ offer up to as much as 11.4 billion euros ($15.8 billion) from 10.5 billion last week.

Construction-to-telecom group Bouygues is vying against local cable operator Numericable to buy France’s second-biggest telecom operator.

On top of the cash, Bouygues is offering 46 percent in the combined SFR-Bouygues to Vivendi.

Numericable’s bid is at 10.9 billion euros and a 32 percent stake in the new entity. Numericable’s backer Patrick Drahi said on Wednesday that he would not raise his bid.

Bouygues got additional firepower on Monday when it agreed to sell its mobile network and some spectrum to smaller rival Iliad for 1.8 billion euros if its bid for SFR is accepted.

A fourth source explained that Bouygues could find the funds for the higher bid by using some Iliad deal proceeds.

When four plan to become three, alarm bells should sound at the competition authorities. The plan by Chiquita and Fyffes to become top bananas in their world, creating distance from global rivals Dole and Del Monte, is no exception.

A combined ChiquitaFyffes might control only about 15% of the global banana market but that could still be enough to change the structure of the market. True, Chiquita serves mostly the US market, whereas Irish-based Fyffes concentrates on Europe, but there is some crossover that can't be ignored. Nor, too, can the impact on smaller producers' attempts to find a viable foothold in a tough market where the pressures at the growers' end of the chain are notoriously intense.

ChiquitaFyffes' best argument is that nobody in the banana-distribution game is making fat profit margins and that supermarkets everywhere are quite capable of protecting consumers' interests. It's not an unreasonable argument – but it should be tested.

As for the deal itself, the financial logic is obvious. Chiquita and Fyffes say they could save $40m a year from "efficiencies in the areas of logistics and procurement". That's a chunky sum in the context of current aggregate top-line earnings of $175m – thus the strong share price reaction, particularly at Fyffes, whose owners would get 49.3% of the combo. The bigger question, though, is whether there's also something in this deal for consumers and banana-growers. The merger will probably happen but let's see it examined properly.###3390||Empty###3391||Tuesday, March 11, 2014

Senator Bob Corker, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, issued the following statement on Tuesday, regarding Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo’s (R-Idaho) announcement on an agreement to reform the housing finance system.

“I have been working with Senator Warner and a bipartisan group of senators for months to advance legislation that ends the failed model of private gains and public losses in our housing finance system and moves our country to a modernized structure that protects the American taxpayer,” said Senator Corker. “I am pleased the Banking Committee is demonstrating their commitment to this effort by putting pen-to-paper and releasing a set of principles based on the bill we introduced, and I look forward to working closely with them in the coming months.”

Chairman Johnson and Senator Crapo announced that the Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act (S. 1217), introduced by Senators Corker and Mark Warner (D-Va.) and cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 10 senators, will serve as the base text for the committee’s housing finance reform bill.

In June 2013, Senator Corker and Warner introduced S.1217 to strengthen America’s housing finance system by replacing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a privately capitalized system that preserves market liquidity and protects taxpayers from future economic downturns.

In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into government conservatorship and given a $188 billion capital injection from taxpayers to stay afloat. As a result of this bailout, the private market has almost completely disappeared, and so nearly every loan made in America today comes with a full government guarantee. Despite this unsustainable situation, there has still been no real reform to our housing finance system since the financial crisis.

In addition to Corker and Warner, S. 1217 is currently cosponsored by Senators Mike Johanns (R-Ne.), Jon Tester (D-Mt.), Dean Heller (R-Ne.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Ks.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Mark Kirk (R-Il.), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), and Mark Begich (D-Ak.), which includes five Republicans and five Democrats from the Senate Banking Committee.###3392||Empty###3393||Empty###3394||China's factory (industrial) output rose 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014 from a year earlier, missing market expectations, with growth in retail sales also weaker than expected, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

London - World stocks held steady, the euro edged down and oil and gold nudged up on Tuesday as traders kept a wary eye on tensions between Ukraine and Russia and the pace of growth in China. That pattern was set in Asia, where markets took a break from recent volatile trading but struggled to do much more than make incremental moves. U.S. stock index futures and benchmark debt were also flat ahead of the Wall Street open.

World shares and the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 were both down 0.1 percent after hovering near the previous day's close for most of the morning, unable to match the marginal gains seen in Asia.

“Market players remain cautious. There's a lack of enthusiasm in chasing stocks, and some are just thinking about moving to the sidelines after the roller-coaster ride we've had since the start of the year,” said Guillaume Dumans, co-head of research firm 2Bremans.

The standout gainer across European indexes was Portugal's PSI 20, which rose 0.8 percent for a gain close to its three-year intraday high, as debt yields in the country dropped to their lowest since April 10 on optimism the country can exit its international bailout programme later this year.

Strong trade data from Germany, the region's economic powerhouse, helped the country's DAX index outperform. But gains were pared by late morning and safe-haven German debt edged off its lows on Ukraine concerns, with Bund futures at 142.64.

“Recent events, especially concerning Russia and Turkey, have made the outlook less certain, and their impact will only be felt in a few months from now,” said Markus Huber, a senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black.

Tensions over Ukraine continued to build on Tuesday. With diplomacy at a standstill, Ukraine's acting president announced the formation of a volunteer national guard, while ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich insisted he remained the country's legitimate leader.

Turkish assets have been hit by political scandals and a power struggle between Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and a U.S.-based Muslim cleric.

EURO DIPS

The euro began the day on a lacklustre note and later extended its dip to be down 0.2 percent against the dollar after a leading central banker reminded the market that the European Central Bank was in accommodative mode.

Elsewhere, a safe-haven bid for the yen kept it flat, even after comments from Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda that there was no need to adjust Japanese monetary policy for now.

“Dollar/yen has been in a range between 101-104 yen for much of this year and the yen needs a fresh trigger for the next leg of weakness,” said Peter Kinsella, currency strategist at Commerzbank. “That could come from a steady deterioration in Japan's trade and current account deficits.”

Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar edged higher by late morning to trade up 0.1 percent.

After recent major ructions in metals markets following February's drop in Chinese exports, prices for industrial commodities bounced off recent lows but trade remained cautious.

Dealers in Asia remained especially nervous about iron ore, however, following an 8 percent slide on Monday that fuelled unease about the health of China's giant steel sector.

Both gold and crude oil extended early gains as Ukraine strengthened the bid in both markets and kept them near intraday highs.

Brent crude, Europe's regional benchmark, gained 49 cents to $108.57 a barrel, while gains for U.S. oil were more measured, ahead 28 cents. Both reversed a slight weakness during the Asian day.

Gold, meanwhile, was at $1,349 an ounce. In a sign of the recent jump in demand, the world's biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday.

“Gold continues to be largely supported above $1,329, and while prices are unlikely to break above $1,361.60 in the absence of war, underlying support from the Ukrainian crisis ... is likely to keep prices elevated above $1,320 for an extended time,” said Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures.

Today at 15:00 (CET) the number of jobs in the U.S. labor market will be released (JOLTS Job Openings). This index is published by the U.S. Department of Labor and includes the data collected over the past month. Employment is one of the basic indicators of U.S. economy, we would expect an optimistic market reaction if it turns out above the expected level of 4,02 M.







4 Hour Analysis



We have a rare divergence signal from the RSI-Bars (14) where the indicator signal line crossed the H4 resistance line. This is a rare outpacing signal of probable price movement upwards. The ParabolicSAR confirms the bullish momentum. The same can be said about the Pivot signal line. The price crossed it upwards, indicating a possible change in trend direction. Nevertheless, we see that the graphical analysis has not confirmed our hypothesis, so you should be extremely careful when opening a position.



We placed a pending buy order near the daily trend line (1.11589). Thus, its intersection will provide a confirmation of the bullish market from the graphical model. The order is recommended to be activated 15 minutes prior to the publication of JOLTS Job Openings and kept in case the actual value rises above the forecast level (4,02 M). Note that the price can also be raised on the news anticipation, because the previous index value was only 3,99 M that is 0,3 M lower than the current forecast. The target area is determined by the Fibonacci upper level (161.8%). But we would be careful and set the take profit level, taking into account the nearest high at 1.11927. The preliminary stop loss is confirmed by the first Pivot support level and the nearest low at 1.10903. As usual, while opening a position it is recommended to move its meaning towards the ParabolicSAR indicator signal.

In a statement sent to TNW, an Alibaba spokesperson explains that this will pave the way for the company to have a more global vision in the future:

Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States. This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals. Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China.

However, Alibaba’s decision to list in the US only comes after the company encountered issues with regulations in Hong Kong. Addressing that, the Alibaba spokesperson says: “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”

Alibaba is China’s largest retail platform for businesses and consumers — and according to analysts surveyed by Reuters, it is expected to file a $15 billion IPO that values the company at more than $100 billion.

Alibaba’s move comes as ‘China’s Twitter’ Sina Weibo also filed for an IPO in the US over the weekend to raise up to $500 million, following reports that it would do so.

Sina Weibo revealed in its filing that as of December, it had 129.1 million monthly active users. For comparison, Twitter has about 241 million monthly active users.

Alibaba is also invested in Sina Weibo — after all, it forked out $586 million for an 18 percent stake in the service last year.

Transactions on Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms have already topped those of Amazon and eBay combined, and company CEO Jonathan Lu mentioned last year that it was aiming to nearly triple the volume of transactions on its marketplace platforms to about CNY3 trillion ($490 billion) by 2016, surpassing Walmart as the world’s biggest retail firm.

A listing in the US would no doubt help Alibaba accelerate its global growth plans. Alibaba revealed last month that it was launching an online shopping site in the US through its subsidiaries Vendio and Auctiva. Before that, the company led a $206 million investment round in US e-commerce logistics firm Shoprunner last year, and subsequently made a subtle but significant play for Western companies after it launched an English language microsite for Tmall, its B2C shopping site for brands.

Alibaba’s IPO filing also comes at a time when the company has been taking steps to branch out into other services as it seeks to strengthen its ecosystem of diverse offerings, in order to capture the attention of users and keep them within its ecosystem, which could ultimately lead to more e-commerce opportunities.

In particular, Alibaba is extremely keen to make its presence felt in mobile — CEO Jonathan Lu already pledged last year to continue its string of big investments as it maintains focus on improving its services for mobile, and the company has been upping efforts to promote its chat app, wooing mobile shoppers with free data and even giving free smartphones to retailers in China. Most recently, it launched mobile games on its Taobao shopping app and Laiwang chat app.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of 4.6 billion US dollars (£2.75 billion) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Fyffes says the merger will benefit its employees in Portsmouth and elsewhere as well as its customers.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of 3 billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at 526 million US dollars (£314.5 million).

The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Livingston and Wakefield as well as at its base at the Portsmouth International Ferryport.

Most bananas sold in Britain are imported through Portsmouth.###3406||Officials have revealed a new timeline suggesting the final voice transmission from the cockpit of the missing Malaysian plane may have occurred before any of its communications systems were disabled, adding more uncertainty about who aboard might have been to blame.

The search for Flight 370, which vanished early March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, has now been expanded deep into the northern and southern hemispheres. Australian vessels scoured the southern Indian Ocean and China offered 21 of its satellites to help Malaysia in the unprecedented hunt.

With no wreckage found in one of the most puzzling aviation mysteries of all time, passengers' relatives have been left in an agonizing limbo.

Investigators say the Boeing 777 was deliberately diverted during its overnight flight and flew off-course for hours. They haven't ruled out hijacking, sabotage, or pilot suicide, and are checking the backgrounds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members — as well as the ground crew — for personal problems, psychological issues or links to terrorists.

Co-pilot spoke final words to ground control

Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Monday that finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out that it might be discovered intact.

"The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope," Hishammuddin said at a news conference.

Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane — "All right, good night" — were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. Any voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, would have been the clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course.

Previous Next

Malaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner's data communications systems — the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System — had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.

However, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS — which gives plane performance and maintenance information — came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.

The new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane's transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.

Flight simulator seized from pilot's home

Turning off a transponder is easy and, in rare instances, there may be good reason to do so in flight — for example, if it were reporting incorrect data.

The Malaysian plane does not appear to fit that scenario, said John Gadzinski, a 737 captain.

"There is a raised eyebrow, like Spock on Star Trek — you just sit there and go, `Why would anybody do that?"' Gadzinski said of what he is hearing among pilots.

Other pilots in the United States cautioned against reading too much into what little is known about the actions of the Malaysia Airlines crew.

"You can't take anything off the table until everything is on the table, and we don't even have an aircraft," said Boeing 737 pilot Mike Karn, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.

Authorities have pointed to the shutdown of the transponders and the ACARS as evidence that someone with a detailed knowledge of the plane was involved. But Bob Coffman, an airline captain and former 777 pilot, said that kind of information is not hard to find in the digital age.

Authorities confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot in what Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar initially said were the first police visits to those homes.

But the government, which has come under criticism abroad for missteps and foot-dragging in releasing information, issued a statement Monday contradicting that account, saying police first visited the pilots' homes as early as March 9, the day after the flight disappeared.

Coffman said the flight simulator could signify nothing more than the pilot's zeal for his job.

"There are people for whom flying is all consuming," he said, noting some pilots like to spend their off-duty hours on simulators at home, commenting on pilot blogs or playing fighter-pilot video games.

Although Malaysian authorities requested that all nations with citizens aboard the flight conduct background checks on them, it wasn't clear how thoroughly the checks were done in Malaysia. The father of a Malaysian aviation engineer aboard the plane said police had not approached anyone in the family about his 29-year-old son, Mohamad Khairul Amri Selamat, though he added that there was no reason to suspect him.

"It is impossible for him to be involved in something like this," said Selamat Omar, 60. "We are keeping our hopes high. I am praying hard that the plane didn't crash and that he will be back soon."

26 countries aid in search

French investigators arrived in Kuala Lumpur to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. They said they were able to rely on distress signals in their search. But that vital tool is missing in the Malaysia Airlines mystery because the flight's communications were deliberately silenced ahead of its disappearance, investigators say.

"It's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult," said Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau.

Malaysia's government sent diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking more planes and ships and asking for any radar data that might help.

The search initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.

It was vastly expanded after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said over the weekend that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7½ hours after takeoff. The signal indicated the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

The vast scope of the search, now involving 26 countries, was underlined when a U.S. destroyer that already has helped cover 38,850 square kilometres of water dropped out.

The Navy concluded that long-range aircraft were more efficient in looking for the plane or its debris than the USS Kidd and its helicopters, so effective Tuesday the ship was leaving the Indian Ocean search area, said Navy Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the 7th Fleet. Navy P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft remain available, and can cover 38,850 square kilometres in a nine-hour flight.

The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water, with little radar coverage.

Hishammuddin said Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, and that countries from Australia in the south, China in the north and Kazakhstan to the west had joined the hunt.

Had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace. Some experts believe it more likely would have gone south, although Malaysian authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that route.

The northern corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan — all of which have said they have no sign of the plane. China, where two-thirds of the passengers were from, is providing several planes and 21 satellites for the search, Premier Li Keqiang said in a statement.

Indonesia focused on Indian Ocean waters west of Sumatra, air force spokesman Rear Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto said.

Australia agreed to Malaysia's request to take the lead in searching the southern Indian Ocean with four Orion maritime planes that would be joined by New Zealand and U.S. aircraft, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.###3407||After what can only be called an epic saga, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos.

FTC launches Herbalife inquiry

The Federal Trade Commission has launched a civil investigation into Herbalife, the Los Angeles-based nutritional-products maker said Wednesday.

Herbalife, which did not disclose any details of the probe, has been battling a hedge fund manager’s allegations that it is running a thinly disguised pyramid scheme.

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC,” the company said in a statement. “We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

Herbalife’s shares sank, closing down more than 7 percent at $60.57, after the company disclosed that the federal agency had sent it a civil investigative demand.

The company sells nutrition and health products through independent salespeople in more than 80 countries.

Its products are not available in stores.

In December 2012, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman accused Herbalife of operating a pyramid scheme.

Ackman has kept up a relentless battle against ­Herbalife, releasing a steady stream of reports that purport to show Herbalife abuses.

Target sees store and Web traffic plunge

It should come as no surprise that Target’s sales were hit by the December data breach that affected millions. But the number of people visiting its stores and Web site fell to the lowest level in three years, according to a recent report.

Only 33 percent of U.S. households shopped at Target in January, a decrease of 22 percent from the same time last year, according to a survey by Kantar Retail, a consulting group. The shoppers who stayed away the most included Gen-Xers — its core demographic — and lower-income, infrequent shoppers who make up a large part of its customer base.

Since the recession, Target has focused on serving its most loyal customers, said Amy Koo, senior analyst at Kantar Retail and a co-author of the report. “But over the last year, they’ve realized that that’s not enough,” and Target has tried to convert its occasional visitors into loyal shoppers.

The data breach threw a wrench into those plans.

Target’s core shoppers, such as its Red card holders, were more likely to be affected by the breach. But they will ultimately stand by the company, according to Koo. Those who shop at Target less frequently, however, have been scared away.

Visits by lower-income shoppers, defined as those who make less than $35,000 per year, decreased by 30 percent from last year, the report said. Visits by shoppers between the ages of 32 and 49 declined by 28 percent from the previous year.

Target did not comment on the findings of the report.

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday, putting the S&P 500 on track for a third day of declines, as concerns grew over the strength of China’s economy.

* London copper, seen as a proxy for China’s economic health, fell to its lowest level since July 2010. Recent economic data has shown signs of economic slowing, while with the country’s first ever bond default last week has increased concerns that financing deals that use the industrial metal as collateral could unravel.

* Geopolitical issues continued to be monitored by investors as earnings season has drawn to a close and amid a light economic calendar this week.

* Ukraine’s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalize rule from Moscow within days.

* S&P 500 e-mini futures fell 5.5 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 42 points and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 13 points.

* EPL Oil & Gas Inc jumped 41.4 percent to $38.25 in light premarket trading after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion, including debt.

* Express Inc dropped 12.6 percent in premarket trading after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations.

* Oxigene Inc surged 145 percent to $5.93 before the opening bell after the company said its experimental drug Zybrestat combined with Roche’s cancer drug Avastin significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a midstage clinical trial.

* European shares fell, weighed down by below-forecast earnings reports and fears of more corporate defaults in China as a persistent decline in the copper price hit the mining sector.

* Asian stocks fell as economic uncertainty in China and the United States combined with political tensions in Ukraine to keep investors cautious.###3410||Empty###3411||(Newser) – Since protests started in Ukraine last December, 661 people have been reported missing—and 272 are still unaccounted for as of last week. This even after opposition members have been given the go-ahead to look for them in prisons, morgues, and hospitals. The figure comes courtesy of Euromaidan SOS, whose coordinator predicts that most of those still missing will resurface. But the New York Times reports that the fear that some, or perhaps many, of the missing could have vanished at the hands of the brutal Berkut riot police, or pro-Russian or pro-Yanukovich forces, still persists, and it cites two cases as contributing to that fear.

One opposition activist was abducted from a Kiev hospital and later found dead in a forest; a man abducted with him says their kidnappers spoke Russian and seemed like police officers. Another opposition organizer was abducted in late January, and though he turned up alive, he said he had been tortured by people he thought were members of Russia's special services. The Euromaidan SOS coordinator insists that rumors of authorities burning bodies of dozens they killed are likely false, yet he notes that bloodstains were found at some police stations where protesters were held. DNA tests are needed, he says, but "this is a huge amount of work, and there is some chance that the police will not do it."###3412||Empty###3413||When MtGox suddenly shut up show with $400 million worth of ‘missing’ Bitcoins last month, the owners of the exchange stated that hackers were responsible for this loss. Whoever had raided MtGox has successfully exploited the transaction malleability bug to divert these funds from the exchange, or so its owners claimed. But suspicions have lingered over how true the hacker story really is, with some claiming that the owners may have simply pocketed the cash for themselves.

Now, following MtGox’s unnerving silence since it made an application for bankruptcy just over a week ago, a group of hackers claims to have broken into the site’s network to find out what the real story is.

According to a report in Forbes, the hacker or hackers successfully compromised Mark Karpeles’ personal blog and Reddit account, before using these two platforms to post ‘evidence’ that the MtGox CEO still had access to some of the missing Bitcoins. They also provided a series of files to support these claims, including a spreadsheet that details over a million Bitcoin transactions; a screenshot that appears to confirm the hackers gained access to MtGox’s network; and Karpeles’ home address.

The hackers also presented a file that show’s MtGox’s bank balance in 18 different currencies. Most tellingly, this file shows that it still has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins – something that hackers say is ‘evidence’ that the exchange’s owners still have quite a stash of BTC. As the hacker’s so eloquently point out, “That fat fuck has been lying!!”

Here’s the full text of the message from the hackers:

The files haven’t been confirmed as genuine, and even if they are real there’s no way of telling if they’re up to date. It could simply show money that MtGox once held, before the hackers made off with their booty – but then again, it could be further evidence of massive theft on the part of Karpeles and others at MtGox.

In its bankruptcy filing, MtGox claimed to have lost around 750,000 Bitcoins that belong to its customers, in addition to 100,000 of its own. However, Bitcoin users have yet to see these missing Bitcoins appear on the public blockchain, which suggests that whoever does have the money is keeping it stashed somewhere.

This weekend’s ‘hack’ comes just days after someone attempted to sell a file containing the personal details and passport scans of MtGox’s users on the BitcoinTalk forum. The ‘owner’ of that 20GB file offered it for sale for 100 bitcoins, “to make up for personal losses from MtGox closure”.

The upgraded app “will extend the company’s leadership in mobile payment and allow customers to recognize Starbucks employees with a tip,” according to the Seattle-based coffee titan.

Beginning March 19, customers using Starbucks App for iPhone in Canada will experience a new design and access to their account and My Starbucks Rewards information. The tip-leaving option will initially only be available for US users.

B2B Payments Intuit On Why Small Biz Can Lead The Way For B2B Payments Change###3418||Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that there was "friction" with the United States, and the world's two biggest economies must respect each other's core interests.

Washington and Beijing have grappled over a range of issues, including human rights, cyber hacking, trade disputes and China's growing military assertiveness over seas contested with its neighbours.

"It's a fact that some friction exists in the course of cooperation, but this is the trouble with cooperation," Li told a news conference at the close of China's annual parliamentary session on Thursday. "Of course, China and the United States, because their history and cultural background are different, and their stage of development is different, there are differences on some issues."

Li did not mention specific issues in US-China relations, steering clear of sensitive domestic and international issues facing China's ruling Communist Party.

The United States is uneasy about what it sees as China's effort to gain creeping control over waters in the Asia-Pacific region. China is in the midst of a sovereignty dispute with US-ally Japan over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. China also has conflicting territorial claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei across a waterway in the South China Sea that provides 10% of the global fisheries catch and carries $5 trillion in ship-borne trade.

For its part, Beijing has expressed concern over the US military "pivot" towards Asia.

Despite the tensions, both sides have an overriding interest in maintaining the health of the world economy.

"As long as we respect each other, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, control well our differences, have equal consultations, and especially pay particular attention to expanding our common interests, then (we will) be able to enhance the level of our bilateral relations," Li said.###3419||We have detected that you do not have JavaScript enabled.

Company and union officials had been trying to sign a new contract for the past 10 months, with the local government helping mediate negotiations.

"In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days," Toyota said in Monday's statement.

"All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lock-out notice.

With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lock-out of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," it added.

A Tokyo-based company spokesman said Toyota hoped to restart production quickly. But he could not give a timeline for any re-opening of the plants, which make a range of models including the flagship Camry sedan, the Corolla and the Prius hybrid.

The two factories, near the city of Bangalore, produce about 310,000 units annually, Toyota said. The fresh strife comes as Japan looks to boost ties with India to counter-balance China's growing influence in the region.###3424||Asian CEOs are mostly declining to take a stand on whether they will speak at an investment conference that has become contentious after the suspected death of Saudi journalist, a contrast with U.S. and European counterparts.###3425||###3426||Denver-based Quiznos has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reduce its debt by more than $400 million after the chain lost ground to competitors.

The toasted sandwich company said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan.

Quiznos says the move won't affect its customers.

The company only owns and operates seven of the nearly 2,100 Quiznos restaurants. The rest are owned and operated by franchisees and aren't part of the bankruptcy proceedings.

Quiznos also says its distribution centers are open and fulfilling orders.

Quiznos, founded in 1981, says the restructuring plan has been approved by its creditors so it expects to emerge from reorganization quickly.

Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, Inc., a food industry consulting firm, said Quiznos operates in a crowded field where other "fast casual" choices for consumers include Jimmy Johns, Firehouse and Jersey Mike's. All were hurt by the recession, but Quiznos had added pressure from franchisees, several of whom have filed lawsuits accusing the company of putting corporate profits ahead of the concerns of franchise owners.

In a statement about its Chapter 11 filing, Quiznos CEO Stuart Mathis said the company was taking steps to support franchisees that included reducing food costs and making loans available to some franchise owners for restaurant improvements.

Tristano said that while Quiznos might be able to slow its decline, the chances of returning to its heyday, when more than 4,000 Quiznos restaurants were operating, are slim.

"There's too much competition," Tristano said.

The Quiznos bankruptcy comes just days after Sbarro declared bankruptcy - again. The Christian Science Monitor reports:

The bankruptcy filing for the Sbarro pizza chain, announced Monday, wasn’t especially surprising for a few reasons. The company is facing hundreds of millions in debt. Last month it announced plans to close 155 of its 400 North American stores. Also, Sbarro just did this, making its second bankruptcy filling in the last three years. Despite changes, including a menu overhaul, Sbarro’s future looks bleak: Foot traffic in malls is dwindling, and the chain is being squeezed at both ends by competitors, as larger pizza chains like Dominos and Papa John’s fight to gain fast food pizza dominance and smaller purveyors continue to make headway. A recent report from Standard & Poor's, the credit ratings agency, recently described the company’s financial structure as “unsustainable.” It’s even been deemed America’s “least essential restaurant.”

The drama between Jos. A. Bank and Men’s Wearhouse has finally come to an end, with the former — the smaller of the two companies — securing an admirable $1.8 billion offer from the latter. The saga will be remembered in the retail sector record books, industry watchers said.

Both companies’ stocks reached record highs on Tuesday. For Men’s Wearhouse /quotes/zigman/233713/delayed /quotes/nls/mw MW , investors were excited about the cost synergy, cross-merchandising and other growth opportunities that are expected to make Men’s Wearhouse a stronger No. 4 player in the U.S. men’s apparel space.

Jos. A. Bank’s maneuvering is being called a brilliant move. Let’s recap: the company launched its initial bid in October, which Men’s Wearhouse rejected and then countered with its own offers. Each party launched its own poison pill, and Jos. A. Bank /quotes/zigman/56759/delayed /quotes/nls/josb JOSB agreed to buy Eddie Bauer to up the game — an “amazing” piece of boardroom maneuvering, analysts said.

Men’s Wearhouse’s final $65 per-share offer marked a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank’s closing price on Oct. 8, a day before it first made a move on its larger rival.

“This has been, assuming everything stays on track, a master class example of how to maximize value for your shareholders,” Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch, adding the premium was far richer than the 30% premium Saks got in its sales to Hudson’s Bay Co. in a high profile recent acquisition. “I can’t think, within retail, of a similarly well-choreographed value-creation waltz like we’ve seen here.”

In his over 40 years as a mergers and acquisition lawyer, Jerry Reisman, a partner at Garden City, New York-based law firm Reisman, Peirez, Reisman and Capobianco, said the deal marked an unusual example of a successful ‘Pac Man’ defense engineered by Men’s Wearhouse.

“Each one was strategically moving to take steps to block the other,” he said in an interview. “A Pac Man defense is unusual. Ultimately Men’s Wearhouse succeeded. Jos. A. Bank (also) got a fantastic offer. I’d give them a 10 for what they accomplished. They did well for Jos. A. Bank shareholders. They might have reached this price long term on their own, but not in the short term. Men’s Wearhouse paid a top price.”

So who is the biggest winner in this deal?

That would be hedge fund Eminence Capital. As Men’s Wearhouse’s largest shareholder with a nearly 10% stake, it also is the fourth largest shareholder of Jos. A. Bank, with a 4.9% stake.

"The parliamentary factions are meeting. There is a consensus on bringing down the government. We are going to put it to the vote shortly," MP Suad Gannur said.

"The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," she added.

Zeidan's government has been repeatedly criticised for its failure to rein in the myriad of former rebel militias which have carved out their own fiefdoms since the NATO-backed uprising that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Gathafi in 2011.

The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital last October.

But in a new humiliation for his government, a North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in the east slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea earlier Tuesday.

The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

Zeidan's government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

Zeidan, an independent elected with the support of liberals, has been the target of previous no-confidence motions in the General National Congress but they have never achieved the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members.

Zeidan accuses his Islamist opponents of seeking to oust him solely to replace him with their own candidate.###3430||Why the yuan will fall after wider trading band 8:19 PM ET Sun, 16 March 2014

The Chinese yuan opened lower on Monday following the Chinese central bank's decision over the weekend to double the currency's trading band and analysts told CNBC they expect it to continue weakening this year.



The People's Bank of China announced on Saturday a widening of the yuan trading band to two percent from one percent. The currency will now be allowed to trade two percent above or below a midpoint fixed by the central bank.

On Monday, the yuan was at 6.1607 per dollar in early trading after the daily midpoint was fixed at 6.1321.

Analysts told CNBC the yuan is set to continue to depreciate, as flows in and out of the country decline amid weaker sentiment.

(Read more: Investors shouldn't fret over Chinese yuan volatility)



"As the economy may weaken further in coming months and the cost of capital may drift lower, the [yuan] exchange rate could be mostly driven by short-term capital flows, which are likely outbound," said Minggao Shen, head of China Country Research at Citi Research.

"The supporting level of [yuan] should depend on export growth (benefiting from a weaker currency), domestic demand (i.e. investment opportunities) and following reform initiatives (which are necessary to lift the economy and market). In the longer term, the exchange rate could break down to below 6 [per dollar], but one-way appreciation is less likely," she added.###3431||German luxury car maker Mercedes Benz today announced commencement of assembly of the S-Class sedan in India and has slashed the car's price by Rs 18 lakh to enhance its position in the country.

The locally produced top-end model S 500 will be priced at Rs 1.39 crore (ex-showroom, Delhi) and will be rolled out from the manufacturing facility in Chakan, Pune, Mercedes-Benz India said in a statement, adding that this strategic move will help to cater to the increasing demand.

In January, the company had launched the S-Class luxury sedan in India, priced at Rs 1.57 crore (ex-showroom, Delhi) for the launch version of the new S-Class, which was fully imported.

The company has already sold out the 125 units of the launch edition allocated by its German headquarters for India.

The new S-Class currently has a waiting period of approximately 3 months, it added.

Mercedes-Benz India Managing Director & CEO Eberhard Kern said: "No other car stands for Mercedes-Benz brand promise more than the S-Class and we are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the-art production facility in Chakan, Pune."

He further said: "This also reiterates our commitment to bring world class manufacturing facilities in India to support our growth in the luxury automotive business."

The company has advanced the plan to locally assemble the S-Class by a couple of months due to robust demand and has opened bookings for deliveries in June.

Currently, Mercedes-Benz India locally produces S-Class, E-Class, C-Class, GL-Class and the M-Class, while it imports completely built units of the A-Class, CLS-Class, SLK-Class and the luxury tourer B-Class, among others.###3432||Empty###3433||Outlook

Attention is focused on China’s trade deficit and growth possibly falling far short of target, but another bit of data over the weekend should not be neglected—China's inflation rate dropped to 2% y/y in Feb, from 2.5% in Jan and 2.6% in 2013, the same as 2012. As everyone notes repeatedly, you can’t trust Chinese data, but if we were to trust the latest inflation data, we should start worrying about deflation instead of inflation. The PBOC target is 3.5%, by the way. Suppliers to China—like Australia—are not failing to notice. A global slowdown inspired by a Chinese slowdown is back on the fear-list, along with the inevitable suggestion that the motive for devaluation is the classic one, to promote exports, in the guise of corralling speculators.

The other big issue is the collection of worries about Europe’s institutional infrastructure. We pretty much stopped worrying about it when the peripheral sovereign debt crisis abated, but the inability to work together to put a bank failure mechanism in place is a pretty big failure. The bank examinations, to be followed by stress tests, have to be credible, too. Meanwhile, the Europeans can’t get their act together on sanctions against Russia, either.

We believe Merkel when she says sanctions are a real possibility, but the French are not willing to give up their sale of warships, and evading sanctions is a time-honored business practice in many countries. Europe has long preferred to spend public money on social programs rather than defense, and why not, since the US has been willing to take that expense. But at some point the absence of a coherent European foreign policy is damaging to reputations. As we have noted many times before, a reserve currency is classically the currency of the top military power of the day. The eurozone is trying to redefine a reserve currency as coming from the bloc that has the gold standard of fiscal excellence. It’s an interesting concept and one that is working so far, but it’s not inconceivable that Russia/Ukraine may derail it.

Finally, at least we have a complaint about the too-strong euro from a top figure, ECB executive Noyer. He said "It is clear that when the euro starts to strengthen it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and additional downward pressure on inflation. Both cases aren't warranted at the moment. We are clearly not very happy at the moment."

Noyer says everything is on track and there is no need for the ECB to take any of the many possible actions if “prospects deteriorate or its economy is hit by a slowdown elsewhere in the world.” Meanwhile, Noyer claims a plan is on track for French banks to securitize bundles of small business loans, possibly as early as end-March or April and forming a model for the rest of Europe.

Gee, what could go wrong? Well, it’s one way to get non-performings off bank balance sheets. Nobody knows or is willing to disclose how bad the bank situation is in Europe. Draghi is probably sweating over this Achilles heel.

The calendar is light this week until Thursday, when we get the usual weekly jobless claims and retail sales. Until then, everyone will watch Russia/Ukraine, China and the European Parliament, all imprenetrable institutions with untrustworthy news bites. This is the ideal environment for a little dollar strength, or at least a decent Tuesday pullback. (Note that the USD/CAD bounced off support in a textbook-perfect response to an oversold condition.###3434||An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy. The man who cobbled the deal together said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million (R1.1 billion at current rates) policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

“Not one company can afford to take a $201m hit,” said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a man he called “a well-known billionaire”.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen’s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said. “It was worse than any audit you can think of.”

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen’s policy.

Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG, which has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

He said the billionaire wanted to remain anonymous for the sake of privacy, and to keep the news from his beneficiaries. “He wants his next of kin to keep working hard.”

He said the man purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax on his death. – Daily Mail###3435||Empty###3436||North Andover, MA (01845)

The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the , with the Dow futures down by 39 points.

The downward momentum for the markets comes following the release of a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.

With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.

Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.

The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.

Nonetheless, trading on Wall Street may be somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Last week, the city of New Haven used its Everbridge Emergency Notification System to remind residents that the deadline to sign up for Obamacare was fast approaching.

“This is an important message from the city of New Haven. Please listen carefully,” a male voice said in a recording of the call provided to CTNewsJunkie.com.

The next voice in the recording is Mayor Toni Harp, a former state lawmaker who once chaired the Medicaid Managed Care Council and worked for two decades as a healthcare administrator.

“Hi, this is Mayor Toni Harp and I want to provide you with some important information about signing up for health insurance. There are free health insurance enrollment events every week in the city of New Haven where you will be able to meet one-on-one with trained and certified individuals who can answer questions and enroll you and your family in health care coverage,” Harp said in the recording. “The Access Health CT open enrollment period officially closes on March 31st. After March 31st you will be eligible to apply for health insurance through Access Health CT only if you have changes in your personal circumstances, or if you qualify for HUSKY.”

HUSKY is the name for the state’s Medicaid program for low-income families and children.

No one has criticized Harp’s decision to use the reverse-dial phone system to warn of the end of the enrollment period.

Laurence Grotheer, Harp’s spokesman, said Sunday that the Everbridge phone system is the same one used to give residents information about parking bans and plowing schedules following winter storms.

“It’s consistent with the city’s policy to use the telephone tree,” he said.

As far as the message is concerned, “the mayor believes it’s in the best interest of residents to avail themselves of healthcare coverage that’s now available.”

In the recorded message, Harp went on to give the city of New Haven website address and the phone number for New Haven’s Public Health Department. The New Haven Public Health Department is an Access Health CT navigator and received funding to guide people through the process of signing up for Obamacare. Access Health CT, the quasi-public agency that manages Connecticut’s insurance exchange, also opened up a storefront in New Haven where people can go to get help with the enrollment process.

Access Health CT planned to spend $15 million on a marketing and advertising campaign to make sure everyone who qualifies enrolls in the program before the March 31 deadline.

What Harp doesn’t mention in her call is the tax penalty imposed on those who don’t have health insurance coverage either through the exchange or outside the exchange before March 31.

In a conference call with reporters Friday, Access Health CT CEO Kevin Counihan stressed that the penalty will be 1 percent of an individual’s adjust gross income or $95 at the minimum.

Those who don’t get coverage on March 31st can still apply through the exchange to get an exemption. There’s exemptions for Native Americans, religious exemptions, and other hardship provisions under the Affordable Care Act. Those who would have to pay 8.5 percent of their monthly income on health insurance, even with the subsidy, are excused from having to purchase it.

“They are the only way other than getting coverage to avoid a tax penalty,” Chad Booker, a policy analyst with Access Health CT, said.

Those who get insurance before March 31 either inside or outside of the exchange will avoid tax penalties, even if they didn’t have coverage for the first part of 2014.

The percent of uninsured residents in New Haven was about 14 percent in 2010, which is higher than the statewide average of about 8 or 9 percent. However, it’s unclear how many of those uninsured received coverage through the exchange since that’s not one of the questions on the application.

As of March 9, Access Health CT had exceeded its enrollment expectations and had signed up more than 150,000 individuals to plans in the exchange and Medicaid since Oct. 1 of last year.###3443||Officers were called to the home in the 300 block of N. 21st Street near Griffiths Avenue around 8:15 p.m. on March 6.

That's where an LMPD spokesperson says the body of 44-year-old James Newton was found inside a home. Police believe he lived in the area.

Foul play was suspected.

"It is being treated as a homicide," said LMPD spokeswoman Alicia Smiley on Thursday.

On Saturday night, police arrested 28-year-old Joseph M. Carter and charged him with murder. Police say they also arrested 28-year-old Sammy Gibson, Jr. Monday afternoon. Police say that on Thursday night, Carter and Gibson got into an argument with Newton and killed him. Police say that at some point after the murder, evidence was removed from the scene and/or destroyed, and that police found property taken from Newton after he was killed.

Both men are charged with murder, tampering with evidence and robbery.

The court said that the European permanent bailout fund didn't violate the German parliament's autonomy on budgetary matters, as long as the Bundestag had a right to veto it and that it could impose limited liability for German taxpayers.



It also stressed that Germany's liability to ESM should not exceed 190 billion euros, and if a need for that arises it has to be approved by parliament.###3446||This December 2, 2013 photo shows a woman reading the HealthCare.gov insurance marketplace internet site in Washington, DC.

WASHINGTON (CBSDC) — A new report finds that one in three Americans who do not have health insurance plan to remain uninsured.

According to the survey done by Bankrate.com, of the 34 percent who say they won’t purchase Obamacare, 41 percent said it was too expensive, 17 percent were against the Affordable Care Act and 13 percent said they were healthy enough not to need coverage.

“It’s hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it’s a case of, ‘I’m in pretty good health, I don’t think about these things, I know I can’t afford it now,'” Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, told Bankrate.com. “I think it’s just rolling past them, and they’re not giving it a whole lot of attention.”

Only 56 percent polled said they plan to purchase health insurance.

Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute, believes that Americans are not purchasing health insurance because the outreach efforts the White House did to reinforce the positive tax subsidies failed to “prompt action.”

“They found in Massachusetts, with “RomneyCare,” that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance,” she told Bankrate.com. “The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant — they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don’t buy coverage.”

The survey also found that only 48 percent of Americans knew that the deadline to purchase Obamacare without facing a penalty is March 31.

“What people need to understand is that the door really closes on March 31,” Corlette said. “It they don’t sign up before then, they’re out of luck until November 15 unless they have one of the special enrollment situations, which happen if you lose your job or get a divorce.”

Bankrate.com’s Health Insurance Pulse Survey was conducted by the Princeton Survey Research Associated International between Feb. 20 and March 9 among 3,005 adults.###3447||This Page Is Under Construction - Coming Soon!

A North Korean-flagged tanker “Morning Glory” is docked at the Es Sider export terminal in Ras Lanuf, March 8, 2014. (Esam Omran Al-Fetori/Reuters)

A team of U.S. Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans, the Pentagon announced this morning.

The Libyans had apparently been trying to sell the oil on the black market.

The action, in international waters near Cyprus, was taken at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, the Pentagon said, adding that no one was hurt.

The ship appears to have been wandering around the Mediterranean piloted by unknown sailors under an uncertain flag, with at least one effort made by three men in a boat near Larnaka to buy oil from it.

According to a Pentagon statement:

“The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra.”

Media reports earlier in the week suggested that the tanker was a North Korean-flagged vessel loaded with 200,000 barrels of oil. But a North Korean official denied that on Thursday, saying the ship-named “Morning Glory” had had its North Korean registration revoked.

Libyan government forces and loyal militia fighters claim a rival militia hoped to load the tanker with oil for export in defiance of central authorities.

A paper in Cyprus reported that authorities there are questioning three people who hired a local boat and tried to buy oil from the tanker.

Libya’s parliament ousted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan on Tuesday after rebels loaded crude onto the ship.

According to the Pentagon statement:

“The boarding operation, approved by President Obama and conducted just after 10 p.m. EDT on March 16 in international waters southeast of Cypress, was executed by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs attached to Special Operations Command Europe. “The SEAL team embarked and operated from the guided missile destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG-80). USS Roosevelt provided helicopter support and served as a command and control and support platform for the other members of the force assigned to conduct the mission. “The Morning Glory will be underway soon to a port in Libya with a team of sailors from the USS Stout (DDG-55) embarked. The sailors will be supervising the transit.”

According to Reuters, the Cypriot ministry of foreign affairs said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a U.S. military escort. It was parked 18 miles southwest of Cyprus when the operation occurred around midnight Cyprus time.

The standoff over control of OPEC member Libya’s oil is one facet of wider turmoil that has engulfed the vast North African country since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago. The government and nascent army have struggled to control brigades of former anti-Gaddafi fighters who have refused to disarm and have used their military muscle to make political demands on the state, often by targeting the vital oil sector.

A week after the collapse of Mt.Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.

In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered – or more often, not covered – by existing law.

The issue took on new prominence in Japan on February 28, when Mt.Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.

Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, “we have not grasped the situation in its entirety."###3452||As an international swarm of boats and aircraft canvass the Gulf of Thailand and west coast of the Malay Peninsula looking for any sign of Flight MH370, an American satellite imaging firm is calling on netizens to help assist in their crowd-sourced search for the missing plane.

According to a press release published by DigitalGlobe on Monday, volunteers can aid the mission by signing up at the group’s Tomnod platform, where they can begin “combing through satellite imagery for clues that may help locate the missing aircraft.”

A representative from the Colorado-based firm said cameras from five of its orbiting satellites had been set on the Gulf of Thailand where the lost plane is believed to have crashed, according to ABC.

The company has already published an estimated 3,200 sq-kms of imagery online that volunteers can begin poring over immediately, and have promised to update their cache of images as more become available.

“[On Monday], the Malaysian government updated the search area to reflect new information, and DigitalGlobe revised its tasking plan to collect imagery further north in the Gulf of Thailand,” read a statement published by the company online. Additional images are set to be released on Tuesday morning.

DigitalGlobe launched a similar campaign in the wake of deadly Typhoon Haiyan, which swept across the Philippines last November, during which time thousands of volunteers flagged over 60,000 objects.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on Saturday morning with 239 people aboard. There was no distress call and no trace of the aircraft has been spotted. Investigators have not so far ruled out any possibilities for what may have cause its disappearance.###3453||There’s still no sign of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane that vanished in mid-flight more than a week ago.

Aviation experts who were involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic five years ago have arrived in Malaysia to help with the investigation.

Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysian Transport Minister, addressed a news conference on Monday afternoon:

“I would also like to address the speculation that Malaysia has held back information about the MH370 movements. For the families, I understand that every day prolongs their anguish, I understand because Malaysia too is missing sons and daughters: there were 15 Malaysians on board the plane. Our priority has always been to find the aircraft,” said Hussein.

Malaysian police have turned their attention to the ground staff, crew members and anyone else on board who had the skills to fly the aircraft.

Investigators searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

As the search operation intensifies, families of the two hundred and thirty nine people on board continue their wait for any word on their loved ones.###3454||Empty###3455||Empty###3456||

Hong Kong has experienced a notable increase in the number of young mainland Chinese women marrying elderly Hong Kong men to obtain residency, and in many cases, housing.

The South China Morning Post cites the Hong Kong Social Welfare Department reporting an increase in the number of documented elderly abuse cases, from 589 in 2013, 408 in 2012, and a mere 368 from 2011-2010. More specifically, Against Elderly Abuse, a Hong Kong welfare agency, noted a trend of Chinese women in their thirties from Hubei and Hunan provinces marrying public tenants “over 60 years old living on welfare,” and cautioned such men to “use caution” as such marriages often turn out “too good to be true.”

The eagerness of some elderly Hong Kong men to walk down the aisle with much younger Chinese women seems to be against the grain in terms of overall Hong Kongers’ distaste for Chinese, but in line with cross-border male preferences for younger female partners.

Tom Rutledge is no fan of multiple visits from the "cable guy," he said during a conversation at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet and Telecom Conference in Florida on Monday.

The Charter Communications CEO said he is working hard to minimize the need to roll out personnel and trucks to customers because "getting that out of the business" improves the quality of the product. One way Charter is accomplishing that is by selling triple-play services so that multiple products can be installed with a single visit and fewer "transactions."

STORY: Charter CEO Still Up for 'Wisely Acquiring' Subs After Comcast-TW Cable Deal

"Taking transactions out of the business actually increases customer satisfaction," Rutledge said. "The opportunity for things to go wrong are legendary. I mean, people make movies about it -- Cable Guy. Getting that out of the business dramatically improves satisfaction."

Rutledge also talked about "a whole bunch of opportunities" for Charter and other cable companies that will come by way of looming 10-gigabyte-per-second Internet speeds and wireless Internet connections in every home.

"We'll have the ability to probably do something along the lines of a 'wireless drop,' meaning a wireless connection for every household, which might not even require a physical connection between the house and the street," he said.

He said that he does not anticipate that consumers will want to navigate giant TV screens with their fingers the same way they do with iPads and other tablets, therefore Charter is focusing on improving remote controls for such functionality.

Of the impending Comcast acquisition of Time Warner Cable -- a company Charter once coveted -- Rutledge said, "We're observing them." He added, "We don't need M&A to be a successful company."

Charter shares, meanwhile, were rising 1 percent to more than $128 a share on Monday during midday trading. Wall Street analysts have been friendly to the stock lately, and, on Monday, Jefferies Group upgraded shares to "buy" with a $150 price target.

hello

A poster alerting customers that the digital currency Bitcoin is accepted as payment sits behind the counter inside a cafe in London. Bitcoin attracted media attention last week when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager's moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.

The past week was particularly extreme. The suicide of an American business executive in Singapore was investigated for possible ties to her Bitcoin investments. A California man fingered as the currency's mysterious inventor reacted to his sudden fame by asking that journalists buy him lunch. After finishing his meal at a sushi restaurant, he went on to deny any role whatsoever in Bitcoin.

Perhaps the most surprising development was that the virtual currency, despite wild fluctuations in value, continued to weather the mayhem. As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.

"Bitcoin works really well," said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. "All this craziness around Bitcoin isn't around Bitcoin itself. It's around the people."

Bitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.

"It's completely Wild West," said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. "There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing."

Bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.

But criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as "hot wallets." Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.

The most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.

Mt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.

"The [Bitcoin] system and protocol itself was and is still sound," Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. "The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry."

Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Canada, followed with its own bankruptcy this past week, again reportedly because of losses to hackers. Criminals apparently relied on an old trick -- once popular against ATMs -- of trying to withdrawal money faster than a bank can rectify accounts, allowing what amounts to a double-dipping of available funds.

Hobbyists and speculators built the first generation of systems for storing and exchanging Bitcoin, despite having little of the expertise need to run financial institutions, Green said. "Look at it like somebody built a skyscraper out of wood," he said. "That's what happened."

Amid the bankruptcies, news reports said that the suicide of a 28-year-old American woman in Singapore may have been related to her job as chief executive of a company that traded virtual currencies, and to her personal investment in bitcoins.

The currency was created by a man who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the name was long thought to be a pseudonym, a Newsweek reporter found the California home of a Japanese American computer engineer who once went by that name before changing it several years ago.

Presented with evidence that he was the Bitcoin inventor, the man appeared to confirm the discovery in an article posted online Thursday. But he recanted -- after asking for lunch -- when a mob of journalists appeared at his home. Newsweek has said it is standing by its story, which included other evidence and interviews with several of the man's relatives.

Rising interest in Bitcoin has brought a flood of investments from venture capitalists, allowing for the development of exchanges that, experts say, are more likely to survive the attacks of hackers and other threats to the currency's stability. The number of merchants accepting bitcoins, meanwhile, has steadily grown, and several cities now have ATMs that trade in them, making exchanges easier.

Bitcoins are traded directly between individuals, without a bank to act as an intermediary. The transactions are recorded on a Web-based public ledger, called a "block chain," that provides a measure of transparency but also allows governments and others to potentially analyze transfers to determine who owns bitcoins and how they are being used. The exchanges are required by laws in the countries where they operate to record who buys bitcoins.

The block chain is scrutinized so carefully that it may be difficult for those who have stolen bitcoins to trade them without being discovered. Experts say it also would be impossible for Nakamoto, the inventor, to cash in any of his personal trove of bitcoins -- rumored to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- without finally and definitively revealing his identity.###3470||Some 319,000 people live in Wirral.

Ignore the pundits and their answer to the Putin problem - the solution to the EU's energy security worries lie in Europe, not the US

From London to Washington politicians and commentators have arrived at a solution to their Putin problem. Russia is weak, their argument claims, because it depends on oil and gas revenue. Unleash American energy on the world and watch the Kremlin crumble. It's a neat answer, because none of the Western powers wants a real war over Crimea, and UK, German, Italian and others' financial interests make them reluctant to back sanctions on Russia.

John Boehner, speaker of the US House of Representatives, says swifter approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports "is one clear step the US can take to stand by our allies and stand up to Russian aggression". Lisa Murkowski, a senator from Alaska, says oil and gas are now a "strategic asset" for the US, which should "be aware of what we have and how important a tool diplomatically an energy asset can be".

Big media names are on board. The Wall Street Journal thinks the US can "use energy as a weapon against Putin", sending LNG first to "our good friends in Europe". In the UK's Times newspaper, one commentator thinks the US unconventionals boom could "kill Russia's energy industry". Another in the Daily Telegraph notes that rising US energy output helped with sanctions on Iran. "Should Moscow be the next testing ground for America's E-bomb?" asks an op-ed.

None of this bears much examination. First, there is nothing the US can do, in energy terms, about Ukraine's plight right now. The first shipments of US LNG, from the Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, are at least two years away. Aside from a sales agreement with the UK's Centrica, there is no guarantee that much of the gas will end up in Europe, let alone reach Ukraine. As Michael Levi, of the Council on Foreign Relations, points out, it isn't the US government that will sell this LNG. Companies will - in markets where prices are highest. For the foreseeable future, that's Asia.

Despite that commercial reality, Texan Congressman Ted Poe has just introduced bill HR 4155, "To authorise natural gas exports to certain foreign countries, and for other purposes". His bill, we are told, may be referred to as the "Fight Russian Energy Exploitation (FREE) Act". It is designed to speed LNG sales to Ukraine, even though Ukraine doesn't have an LNG import terminal.

Lifting the ban on US exports of crude oil is a great idea - at least for US producers keen to export into the global market. But despite the success of the US tight oil sector, the country is still the world's second largest oil importer (China overtook it last year), and will be for years. Total imports this year will be about 6m barrels a day (b/d) - more than Germany, the UK and France, the EU's three biggest consumers, together used last year.

Oil is a global market in which any US exports would barely make a dent. As the US remains a net importer, any oil sent out of the US would have to be replaced by oil brought in. Opening this trade in both directions might bring down global prices a bit. And it might just narrow the differential between WTI and Brent. Can someone explain how that would punish Russia?

Risk premium

Alternatively, runs another idea, the US could use some of the 700m barrels of oil in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to weaken global prices. This is absurd. Not much of the oil could be released quickly. It wouldn't necessarily compete with Russian Urals exports. Any dip in the SPR's volume would have to be replaced -because, after all, the reserve is there to deal with shortages and emergencies. What about the long-term impact of such a move? Just as the Arab embargo of the 1970s injected a political risk premium into oil prices for decades after, such an SPR move from the US would forever hang over markets when something, somewhere, annoyed American politicians. Does the US really want to toss away its free-market principles on an untested, silly foreign policy tool?

Apparently forgotten in these daft proposals is that the US is now the world's high-cost marginal oil producer. Its tight oil success has come thanks to sustained high oil prices. Engineering some kind of slump - even if it were possible - would put future tight oil supply growth in jeopardy. It would also need the cooperation of producers in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia. Is it in any big producer's interests to weaken global oil prices to the kind of level that would hurt Russia?

As the world's biggest oil producer and biggest gas exporter, Russia doesn't have much to fear from any of these ploys. Its gas sales to Europe rose to 162bn cubic metres (cm) last year, or 33% of the continent's market. It still meets a third of Europe's oil needs. By May, it hopes to have signed a 30-year gas sales agreement with China, to export 38bn cm.

Lost opportunity

Both Gazprom and Europe can cope without Ukraine's transit of Russian gas to Europe, at least for the short term. The 55bn cm/y Nord Stream pipeline to Germany has spare capacity should Russia divert exports away from Ukraine. In the medium term, Gazprom will also have South Stream, its 63 billion cm/y link through the Black Sea to Bulgaria and central Europe, on stream by 2015. Europe's dependence on Russian gas - between 50% and 100% for every country, aside from Romania, that lies east of Trieste - is growing.

The best time to reduce this exposure to Russian gas has passed. The Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, which will pipe up to 12bn cm/y from Azerbaijan to southern Europe by 2018, is the only real outcome of the EU's efforts to build alternative import routes earlier this century. The grander Nabucco project, which would have opened the so-called southern gas corridor, has failed.

As the world's biggest oil producer and biggest gas exporter, Russia doesn't have much to fear

Brussels propagated several fantasies: that the Caspian had enough gas to become a viable competitor to Russian imports; that Iraq, whose associated gas reserves lie in the south, might feed some supply through Turkey to the EU; that Nigeria, lacking its own electricity, would send gas to Europe across the Sahara; or that Turkmenistan gas could flow across the Caspian, even though Russia, a Caspian littoral state, can stop a pipeline being built across the sea. Unstable North Africa was to be the other rival to Russia. But in the past three years its exports to Europe have fallen from 71.6bn cm to 48.5bn cm.

All aboard the Gazprom express

Meanwhile, domestic policies across Europe have left any semblance of an EU-wide energy strategy in shreds. Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power has wedded it to Russian gas (and left the continent desperate for coal). Hungary, Austria and the Balkan states backed South Stream, not Nabucco. Gas-rich Netherlands jumped aboard the Gazprom express when Gasunie signed up to Nord Stream and plotted ways to ship Russian gas further west.

Domestic shale gas could make a difference - but not for a decade, at least. Poland, once considered the country with the best prospects and, given Gazprom's domination of its supply, most reason to exploit its shales has failed at the first hurdle. Officials used to working with Russian partners, say some Polish critics, have successfully thwarted their own country's interests. Ukraine's own reserves are years away from production, too.

Shale optimism has since shifted to the UK. In theory, a shale boom there could see some gas move onto the continent. But no one knows how much it will cost; and the volumes are unlikely to knock Russian gas out of the market anyway. Likewise, new LNG receiving terminals in Poland and Croatia will offer alternative supply only on the margin. It is expensive, too. Extra LNG imports into Europe would end up costing 35-40% more than Russian gas, says Goldman Sachs. And thanks to Russian supplies, Europe can't stomach higher prices. Imports of LNG were 86.7bn cm in 2010, but fell to 45.8bn last year, as cargoes were diverted to better-priced markets in Asia. Only a decision by Japan to restart its nuclear sector would change that dynamic.

The arrival of new US LNG supplies from six planned export plants may bring down global gas prices over time. But the expectation of those supplies has also hindered other developments: consumers in Asia, awaiting cheaper US gas, have been reluctant to sign new purchase agreements from other planned LNG projects, slowing future upstream plans.

Europe's economy is also too vulnerable to risk the kind of energy war being talked about so blithely in the US. Ukraine may be less important to EU imports now than it was the gas wars of 2006 and 2009. But a supply interruption would still be a problem. And sanctions on Russian gas would send prices soaring. Another European recession could follow that kind of price shock. Sure, it would hurt Russia as well, because it can't quickly switch its supplies to another market. A trade embargo, says Citi, a bank, would be a "serious negative-sum event". In energy terms, Europe and Russia are in a lock. Whatever other solutions the West comes up with, turning energy into a weapon isn't the answer.

Car sales in Europe jumped for the sixth consecutive month in February, boosted by economic recovery in Portugal, Spain and Italy. Sales rose 7.6 percent across the region in February as demand continued to increase. Price cuts by some leading market players have also contributed to the rise in registrations.

According to the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association (ACEA), registrations rose to 894,730 vehicles from 831,371 recorded in February 2013. Sales in the two first months of 2014 increased 6.3 percent to 1.86m cars.

[F]igures are excellent news both for the industry and in terms of European recovery overall, as car sales have been subdued for since the beginning of the crisis

ACEA figures also reveal that France was the only market within the EU where automobile sales declined in February. Meanwhile, sales in Spain, Portugal and Ireland increased by 17.8, 40.2 and 20.6 percent respectively over the same period, indicating modest recovery across some of Europe’s most fragile economies. Sales in Italy increased by a more modest, but still impressive, 8.6 percent.

Renault Group reported increased sales of 11.5 percent, mostly driven by its Dacia line; sales of the no-frills, affordable vehicles were up 33.6 percent. Ford, Toyota and General Motors were also up by 11.3, 14 and 12.3 percent respectively. GM’s Open and Vauxhall lines especially, were up by 15.6 percent.

Overall, registrations of more basic or budget lines were up across Europe, boosting sales numbers across the range. Volkswagen reported an increase of 7.2 percent overall, but its more affordable Skoda brand was up over 21.5 percent.

Overall, figures are excellent news both for the industry and in terms of European recovery overall, as car sales have been subdued for since the beginning of the crisis.

The recovery, however slow, has brought better financing options for buyers, and as President Mario Draghi has announced he expects interest rates “to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,” it is likely sales will continue to climb.###3474||Mortgage applications decreased 2.1 percent from one week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending March 7, 2014.

It has seen no shortage of bad news in the years since the financial crisis -- including a weak 2013 holiday season, a boot from the S&P 500 and a below-$10 stock price that was once closer to $80 a share -- but according to Citi analyst Oliver Chen, brighter days are on their way. Chen upgraded the beleaguered retailer's rating from neutral to a buy Tuesday morning, sending JC Penney stock surging 7.5% in pre-market activity.

In upgrading JC Penney from a neutral to a buy, Citi raised the retailer's price target up from $8.42 to $11, a level the stock hasn't seen since September 2013. "We’re upgrading JCP to buy based on our conviction that JCP can continue to deliver positive comp store sales in-line with fiscal 2014 guidance," Chen writes in the report. "We believe this can happen as JCP fixes home, focuses on restocking basics & private branded product, and edits out inappropriate merchandise."

That guidance, provided in the company's fourth quarter earnings results released last month, included a full-year comparable store sales increase in the mid single digits, a "significantly" improved gross margin and liquidity in excess of $2 billion at year-end. Focusing just on 2014's first fiscal quarter, JC Penney said in February that it expects a first quarter comparable store sales increase between 3% and 5% with depreciation and amortization totaling $155 million.

Chen acknowledged that JC Penney still has a long way to go -- and indeed, the company reported a $1.4 billion net loss for full-year 2013 -- but added that he and his team "like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014."

He added that the "Street doesn’t believe JCP can generate positive comp store sales, but we do." In Citi's view, the growth will be driven by the home and kid categories, which account for 20% to 25% of JC Penney's business mix. If the combined categories can comp 20%, it yields a 5% benefit for the company overall. Citi sees reason for optimism in these areas almost purely due to the fact that Ron Johnson is no longer the company's CEO.

"In our view, not so good decisions made under former CEO Ron Johnson considerably impacted performance in 2013. The home department was the major tailwind in the first half of the year, while trouble in kids from a merchandise point of view was the tailwind in the second half of the year," Chen wrote. Looking ahead, this should translate into better comparisons in 2014, Chen said, noting that in correcting Johnson's mistakes in the home category -- mistakes that included a pricing overhaul, a new shop environment and new partners -- JC Penney's home goods segment has regained momentum. "Although management noted that 'fixing home has been a challenge,' customers have responded positively to the changes, with home up in the fourth quarter," Chen wrote.

It's worth noting that Citi's new, bullish stance is a bit of a return to tradition -- though not nearly as bullish at it was in the past. Now-former Citi analyst Deborah Weinswig gave the retailer a $28 price target in 2012, writing at the time that “J.C. Penney is clearly not out of ammo, as it showcased a dazzling display of technology, outgunning the competition." However, a year later Weinswig had changed her mind, downgrading the stock to a sell in September and predicting that its price would fall to $7 per share -- a prediction that came to fruition little more than than one month later.

Following Citi's upgrade, shares of JC Penney surged 7.5% in Tuesday's pre-market trading and are now up 8.6% -- and climbing -- in the early part of Tuesday's regular trading session.###3476||ADVERTISEMENT

Enlarge | Buy This Image

Chrysler Group LLC plans to hire up to 1,000 part-time employees for the Toledo Assembly complex to keep production rolling while giving regular employees the chance for a break.

“Our people have been working a tremendous amount of hours,” Plant Manager Chuck Padden said. “To get them more time off is important to us, to make sure they’re refreshed, and can work safely.”

With record demand for the Jeep Wrangler and the launch of the new Jeep Cherokee last year, employees are regularly working 60 hours a week. And while employees generally like the extra pay that results from working overtime, such lengthy stretches can wear on workers, he said.

A company spokesman said Monday that Chrysler has hired 380 temporary part-time employees this year, though 50 have been converted to regular, full-time employees.

Chrysler has collected applications for the jobs and is not currently accepting any more. Officials are in the process of conducting assessment testing and expect more employees to be brought on in the coming weeks.

Most of the new hires will get between 10 and 30 hours per week.

“It can vary, depending upon on the teams they’re on. Typically it’s a Friday-Saturday-Monday situation,” Mr. Padden said. “So if we’re scheduled for six days, TPT [temporary part-time] could be here three of them. Some of them might only work one day a week.”

The TPT employees are paid $15.78 an hour, the same rate as new full-time hires. They’re also offered limited benefits, including health insurance.

How long the new temporary part-time jobs last depends mostly on demand for the two vehicles built there.

While it isn’t unusual for automakers to use part-time help to ease the burden at busy plants, it’s not typically done to this level. Officials from the company and the union both said it’s an innovative solution that will boost production, allow weary workers more time off, and bring new employees into the plant.

Bruce Baumhower, president of United Auto Workers Local 12, said the help should take some of the load off employees who have worked long hours for a long time.

“They’ve worked through the Christmas shutdown the last couple years; they’ve worked through summer shutdowns. Summertime’s coming; they’ve got kids in Little League and other things,” he said. “They’ve done an unbelievable job of carrying the load.”

Mark Epley, UAW Local 12’s Jeep Unit Chairman and one of the key people in brokering the deal, said it’s important to get employees a little time off.

“You’ve gotta remember, these people are working 10 hours a day, six days a week,” he said.

The contract currently gives employees the right to take off a Saturday after working consecutive Saturdays. With the addition of part-time workers, employees will be able to take off other days as well.

“It’s very important to have the day off you want with your family,” he said.

The added help will allow the plant to run the Wrangler line every Saturday, which they haven’t been able to do. That’s important to Chrysler, which is trying to squeeze even more Wrangler production out of the plant this year after a record year in 2013.

That task falls on Mr. Padden, who took over as plant manager on Jan. 1.

Mr. Padden, 54, has been with Chrysler since 1995 and is on his third tour in Toledo. He most recently served as the launch manager for the Cherokee, then took over the top position in the plant following former plant manager Zach Leroux’s promotion to head of assembly operations for Chrysler.

“We’ve got a lot of good things going for us right now,” Mr. Padden said. “As the volume is picking up we’ll be one of the largest manufacturing sites in North America. We won’t talk specifics on the numbers, but we’ll be one of the largest manufacturing sites in North America with the two [lines] going at full tilt.”

Mr. Padden said Chrysler’s goal for the plant is to build 2,000 vehicles a day. Currently, employees at the Toledo Assembly complex build about 840 Wranglers and 990 Cherokees a day. Mr. Padden said the Cherokee line should reach full capacity in the year’s third quarter.

Right now the focus for Cherokee is on fine-tuning the build process and ramping up work on building international models. Jeep officials have said they plan to eventually sell the Cherokee in 150 countries.

“Every country has its own unique specifications they want to see. Everything from the way VIN stamps are put into a car to the way to the dashboard reads and the way the radio reads,” Mr. Padden said.

Chrysler expects about 15 percent of Cherokees built in Toledo to be destined for international markets.

Mr. Padden praised the work force in Toledo and its good working relationship with the company. He also understands Jeep’s importance to the city.

“It’s not just another company out there. We’re so integrated into the community of Toledo,” he said. “We recognize the interdependence of Jeep to Toledo. Continuing to work together, we hope to be here for a long, long time.”

* Clashes between rebels, pro-government militias reported

* Western powers fear chaos in oil-producing Libya (Adds Zeidan banned from travelling abroad, paragraph 8)

By Ulf Laessing and Feras Bosalum

TRIPOLI, March 11 (Reuters) - Libya’s parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after rebels humiliated the government by loading crude on a tanker that fled from naval forces, officials said, in a sign of the worsening chaos in the OPEC member state.

Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya’s eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed.

Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues.

Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening.

Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya’s first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya’s anarchic transition since 2011.

Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels.

“The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,” said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said.

State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities.

Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.

But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker.

When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government.

Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire.

“The ship was damaged and it is not moving,” he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defence ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time.

It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga.

It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret.

TRANSITION GETS MORE COMPLICATED

Zeidan’s exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya’s transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions.

Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya’s lifeline.

Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail.

Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defence minister gave his oath.

But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports.

Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available.

In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.

Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.

The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.

They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi.

Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman. (Additional reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli in Es Sider; Editing by Mark Heinrich)###3479||Washington: The missing plane Malaysia Airlines MH370 kept flying after it dropped off controllers’ radar screens, raising new questions about whether foul play was involved,according to people familiar with data gathered in the inquiry.

Aviation specialists investigating last week’s loss of MH370 say evidence gathered so far suggests the plane travelled west over Malaysia, possibly continuing for hours, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the probe is active.

“News reports that the aircraft may have continued flying for some time after the last transmission of engine data are inaccurate,” acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in Kuala Lumpur.

The comments by investigators adds a new note of mystery to the 8 March disappearance of the Malaysian Airline System BHD. plane carrying 239 people that vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Data compiled so far show no evidence of a crash near the Malaysian peninsula, the people said. “The airline has no information on this,” a spokeswoman at Malaysian Air said, declining to be identified.

“I can’t think of a single example of a large airplane completely disappearing without seemingly leaving a trace for this many days,” said Hans Weber, president of Tecop International Inc., a San Diego-based consultant. “It remains a mystery.”

“US investigators increasingly suspect the act was criminal,” one person said without elaborating.

Fuel reserves

Radar signals sent from the ground continued to reflect back from the plane after its transponder went dead as the aircraft headed north from Malaysia toward Vietnam, said the people, who weren’t permitted to speak publicly about the probe.

After the transponder shut off, making it harder to follow on radar, the plane turned left toward the west instead of continuing on its path. An automatic system that sends data about the health of the plane’s engines may also have continued to function, indicating the aircraft was being operated intentionally, the people said.

“That suggests The Boeing Co. 777-200 may have been flown off course with the intent to fly undetected, by the pilots or hijackers. Malaysia isn’t cutting back on the search, and instead has intensified its efforts,” Hishammuddin said.

“Malaysia has nothing to hide,” he said. “We have spared no expense and no effort.”

Andaman Sea

The 777 had enough fuel to fly the 2,700 miles (4,345km) to Beijing and reserves to fly to a diversion airport. That meant it was capable of flying at least 2,000 miles after it changed course. The Wall Street Journal reported that the plane stayed in the air for about four hours after reaching its last confirmed location.

The aircraft’s transponder normally sends radio beacons to ground radar stations making it easier to follow and providing other information, such as its identity and altitude. While it’s possible for it to malfunction or be accidentally switched it off, it is highly suspicious for the device to fail at the same time a plane makes an abrupt change of course.

“The plane continued to fly west toward the Andaman Sea, only dropping off Malaysian radars as it reached the end of their range,” the people said. “The information raises as many questions as it answers about the case and was still being assessed by officials.”

“Indian Navy and Coast Guard have sent ships and aircraft to aid Malaysia in its search for the missing plane,” said a government official, who asked not to be identified as the person wasn’t authorized to speak on the subject. “India will search the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand starting Thursday, based on a request by Malaysia,” the official said.

Satellite images

Planes and ships from a dozen countries scouring land and sea on both sides of Peninsular Malaysia have yielded few answers on what caused Flight MH370 to disappear. Vietnam sent a plane to verify Chinese satellite images that appeared to show three floating objects, only to find nothing there.

The images were the newest that investigators were chasing, including an unexplained radar blip detected in the area of the Malacca Strait, about 2.15am. (local time) on 8 March, or 45 minutes after contact was lost with the jet flying to Beijing through the Gulf of Thailand.

Transponder signals

“The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is supporting the Department of Defence to find the missing aircraft,” said spokesman Donald Kerr in an e-mailed statement. DoD is following up on all leads on the potential path of the aircraft, and is assisting the US pacific command in their wide area search for debris fields.

Planemaker Boeing said it already has investigators on site to assist the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). “These teams would probably include 777 structures experts who can quickly identify crucial aircraft components,” said John Purvis, a retired accident investigator who headed Boeing’s investigations unit for much of the 1980s and 1990s.

Miles Kotay, a Boeing spokesman, wouldn’t say whether the world’s largest planemaker is reviewing the satellite imagery to determine whether the pieces came from the Malaysian Air jet. “While we stand ready to assist investigators as needed, we do not comment on specifics,” Kotay said in an e-mail.

All energies

Flight MH370’s route took it over the Gulf of Thailand, where the plane was approaching Vietnamese airspace when controllers lost contact. Signals from the jet’s transponder, a beacon that helps increase the plane’s visibility on radar screens, also ended then.

The absence of wreckage has kept alive various theories about the plane’s disappearance, from an accident to hijacking to sabotage.

While the Gulf of Thailand initially took primacy in the hunt because of Flight MH370’s last known position, Malaysia expanded the search this week to the Malacca Strait. On Wednesday, Malaysia sought help from US investigators in interpreting an unexplained radar blip detected over the strait, far from the route.

“We are devoting all our energies to the task at hand,” Hishammuddin said. “And I want to be very clear: our focus has been on finding the aircraft. We have not done anything that could jeopardize the search effort.” Bloomberg###3480||* EPL Oil to be acquired by Energy XXI for $2.3 bln

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, as equities recouped much of their earlier declines amid signs of progress in diplomatic attempts to ease tensions in Ukraine.

Stocks were pressured by concerns about a weakening economy in China. London copper prices, seen as a proxy for economic health due to its broad industrial use, rebounded after hitting their lowest level since July 2010.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in London on Friday ahead of a Sunday referendum on whether Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula will join Russia or go independent. The legality of the referendum is disputed.

Spot gold hit a six-month high on its safe-haven appeal.

However, money is on the sidelines and investors worried about missing another leg-up in the five-year U.S. equity bull market are keeping indexes near recent highs, analysts say.

“The situation in Ukraine and a slowing China are going to matter but they haven’t mattered yet. Commodity prices are falling and that is tied to demand,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“People think they missed out and the market is going to do the same it did last year,” she said. “There’s more retail money flowing into the system, supporting stocks.”

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.06 points or 0.28 percent, to 16,305.19, the S&P 500 lost 3.81 points or 0.2 percent, to 1,863.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.604 points or 0.11 percent, to 4,311.792.

Geopolitical developments have moved to the forefront this week on a vacuum of major corporate results and market-driving economic data. The S&P 500 closed at a record high last Friday.

“We’ve climbed so far, to continue to climb is definitely going to be a see-saw move,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Herbalife fell 7.5 percent to $60.50 after the company said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations. Shares briefly fell as much as 16 percent.

Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell sharply on Wednesday, a day after leaders of the Senate Banking Committee announced an agreement on legislation to wind down the government-owned mortgage financiers. Fannie lost 9.9 percent to $3.63 and Freddie fell 15.8 percent to $3.40.

EPL Oil & Gas Inc jumped 29.8 percent to $37.79 after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion including debt. Energy XXI shares lost 6.4 percent to $21.88.

Express Inc dropped 12.8 percent to $15.91 after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations.

Oxigene Inc surged 71.5 percent to $4.15. The company said its experimental drug Zybrestat, combined with Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a mid-stage clinical trial.

Geron Corp plunged 61.8 percent to $1.68. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a halt to trials of a cancer drug over concerns about potential liver damage.###3481||PARIS--The slow pace of price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday.

"The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness," Mr. Noyer said. "This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability."

A country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero.

Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term.

Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.

"Low inflation is not deflation," Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. "There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages."

He warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.

"The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks," Mr. Noyer said. "Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking."

The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.

Write to Gabriele Parussini at gabriele.parussini@wsj.com###3482||King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, expects to be worth up to US$7.6bil (RM24.98bil) when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated US$17bil (RM55.89bil) market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

Candy Crush, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same colour, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at US$21-US$24 (RM68.87-RM78.76) per share, valuing it at up to US$7.6bil (RM24.98bil) — slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year-old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realise a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

"I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5% stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

Another Zynga?

Candy Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".

Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to US$602mil (RM1.97bil) in the fourth quarter of 2013 from US$22mil (RM72.19mil) in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fuelled by Candy Crush rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at Dec 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to US$17bil (RM55.75bil) this year from just US$6bil (RM19.68bil) in 2010.

Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of Farmville waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of Angry Birds.

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for US$527mil (RM1.72bil) and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended Dec 31 declined 3% from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in Candy Crush gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga. About 73% of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

"The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."

NYSE debut

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of US$714.3mil (RM2.34bil) in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as US$532.8mil (RM1.74bil), slightly more than the US$500mil (RM1.64bil) placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2% of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

PARIS (AP) - Global growth is likely to remain sluggish as a slowdown in the developing world undercuts gains in Europe and the United States, a leading international economic body warned Tuesday.



The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said one-off factors like the harsh winter weather in North America and the U.S. government shutdown mean "growth for the major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be somewhat slower than in the second half of 2013."



The underlying trend for those economies, however, continues to be of strengthening growth, said the OECD, a think tank for the world's most developed countries, in an update to forecasts made in November.



Meanwhile, emerging economies, which now account for over half the world economy, "are experiencing a marked loss of momentum," the OECD said. If that continues, the OECD warned it "is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term."



In its World Economic Outlook, the organization forecasts global growth of 3.6 percent this year, from an estimated 2.7 percent in 2013. It says the recovery in the United States "is relatively well established," contrary to what it sees happening in the EU and Japan, where the OECD called for further monetary stimulus.



The OECD warned that while activity in the EU seems to be improving, "so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than in the other major economies."



It also warned that the dip in growth in the U.S. over the winter could have longer-lasting repercussion. "If the recent economic weakness were to durably depress confidence, it could undermine the recovery," the OECD said.###3484||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

Dr Nemat Shafik joins from International Monetary Fund

Former civil servant takes charge of Bank's markets oversight



Will also oversee unwinding of £375bn of Bank's asset purchases

Bank faces claims staff colluded in foreign currency rigging for 10 years



The Bank of England has named two new deputy governors as part of a shake-up of Mark Carney’s leadership team.

The new appointments come amid damaging claims that some of the Bank’s staff may have been involved in manipulating the £3trillion-a-day global foreign exchange markets for almost 10 years.



International Monetary Fund deputy managing director Nemat Shafik will take on the newly-created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.

Market oversight: Dr Nemat Shafik will have oversight of the way the Bank of England monitors financial markets

Dr Shafik, who will be the first female deputy governor since Rachel Lomax left in 2008, is to conduct a root and branch review of how the Bank monitors markets.

The selection of a woman is a political coup for Chancellor George Osborne on the eve of his fifth Budget as Chancellor. The nine-strong MPC has not included a woman since Kate Barker left in 2010. There has never been a female Bank of England governor.



Meanwhile Ben Broadbent - one of the Bank's nine-strong team on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee – has been named as successor to Charlie Bean, the outgoing deputy governor for monetary policy.



Both will assume their roles on August 1.



Anthony Habgood will become the new chairman of the court of the Bank of England.



External appointment: Former Goldman Sachs economist Ben Broadbent is the first external member of the MPC to join the Bank of England as a deputy governor

Mr Habgood, who is chairman of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread, will take over from Sir David Lees on July 1 as the supervisory body comes under criticism for its governance oversight in the wake of the forex claims.



Both deputy governors will serve five-year terms and sit on the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, which regulates banks, and MPC. Dr Shafik will take the MPC seat currently held by the Bank’s executive director for markets, Paul Fisher.



Dr Shafik - who has Egyptian, US and British nationality - has been the IMF's deputy managing director since April 2011 and before that was the top civil servant at Britain's overseas aid department.



She will be responsible for the Bank’s eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy - under which it amassed £375billion of government bonds - as well as reviewing the way the central bank gathers intelligence on markets which has come under scrutiny recently after claims that London traders manipulated key foreign exchange rates.

Mr Broadbent was formerly an economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs and is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor at the central bank.###3487||Investing.com - Gold prices edged higher on Monday as the ongoing Russian standoff in Ukraine bolstered the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge, though Friday's strong U.S. jobs report and soft Chinese trade figures watered down gains.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,339.60 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.10%, up from a session low of $1,328.20 and off a high of $1,344.90.

The April contract settled down 1.01% at $1,338.20 on Friday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,320.10 a troy ounce, the low from Feb. 28, and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Monday.

Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices.

Strong U.S. employment numbers and weak Chinese trade figures strengthened the dollar and capped gold's gains, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase.

January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.

The data extended the dollar's gains into Monday, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.

Fed bond purchases, currently set at $65 billion a month, soften the dollar by suppressing interest rates to spur recovery by encouraging investing and hiring.

Weak Chinese trade data supported the greenback as well by bolstering its appeal as a safe-haven asset class.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling and sent investors seeking safety in gold.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 0.55% at US$20.813 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were down 1.30% at US$3.042 a pound.###3488||Trade-Ideas LLC identified Dick's Sporting Goods DKS ) as a post-market leader candidate.

But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, DICKS SPORTING GOODS INC increased its bottom line by earning $2.31 versus $2.10 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.69 versus $2.31).

Compared to where it was 12 months ago, the stock is up, but it has so far lagged the appreciation in the S&P 500. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year.

DKS's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.08 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Even though the company has a strong debt-to-equity ratio, the quick ratio of 0.16 is very weak and demonstrates a lack of ability to pay short-term obligations.

The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Specialty Retail industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity, DICKS SPORTING GOODS INC has underperformed in comparison with the industry average, but has exceeded that of the S&P 500.

That scenario would make finding the Boeing 777 a vastly more difficult task, and raises the possibility that searchers are currently looking in the wrong place for the plane and its 229 passengers and crew.

In the latest in a series of false leads, planes were sent Thursday to search an area off the southern tip of Vietnam where Chinese satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects.

They saw only ocean.

“There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,” said acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein.

Compounding the frustration, he later said the Chinese Embassy had notified the government that the images were released by mistake and did not show any debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.

The plane left Kuala Lumpur and was flying northward across the South China Sea to Beijing early Saturday when it lost contact with ground controllers and civilian radar.

An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea. A roughly similar-sized hunt is also being conducted to the west in the Strait of Malacca because of military radar sightings that might indicate the plane headed that way after its last contact, passing over the Malay Peninsula.

The Wall Street Journal quoted U.S. investigators on Thursday as saying they suspected the plane remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane's engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program.

Hishammuddin said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both said the last engine data was received at 1:07 a.m., around 23 minutes before the plane lost contact.

But asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said: “Of course, we can't rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. We are expanding our search into the Andaman Sea.” The sea, part of the Indian Ocean, is northwest of the Malay Peninsula.

He said Malaysia was asking for radar data from India and other neighboring countries.

India plans to deploy airplanes and ships in the southern section of the sea, a senior Indian official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

More than two-thirds of those on board the plane were from China, which has shown impatience with the absence of any results. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that it he would like to see better coordination among countries involved in the search.

The passengers' “families and friends are burning with anxiety, the Chinese government and Chinese people are all deeply concerned about their safety,” he said at the close of the annual session of the country's legislature. “As long as there is a glimmer of hope we will not stop searching for the plane.”

He said China had deployed eight ships and was using 10 satellites to search for the plane.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the plane's disappearance.

Experts say a massive failure knocking out its electrical systems, while unlikely, could explain why its transponders, which identify it to civilian radar systems and other nearby planes, were not working. Another possibility is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.

The jet had enough fuel to reach deep into the Indian Ocean.

Malaysia's air force chief said Wednesday that an unidentified object appeared on military radar records about 200 miles northwest of Penang, Malaysia, and experts are analyzing the data in an attempt to determine whether the blip is the missing plane.

Malaysia has received some criticism for its handling of the search, in part because it took several days to fully explain why it couldn't state for sure whether the plane had turned back.

Officials say they are not hiding anything and are searching in areas where the plane is mostly likely to be.

Dozens of ships and aircraft from 12 nations have been searching the Gulf of Thailand and the strait, but no confirmed trace has been found. The search area has grown to 35,800 square miles, or about the size of Portugal.

Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean then some debris should be floating on the surface even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.###3491||Empty###3492||Experience the AFR for half the price

By David Gaffen

NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Major world equity markets were mostly steady on Tuesday, the euro edged down and gold rose as traders kept a wary eye on tensions between Ukraine and Russia and the pace of growth in China.

Markets have taken a break from recent volatile trading, and moves in most major stock markets were relatively muted. An index of global stocks was trading around break even, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 nudged higher.

“Market players remain cautious. There’s a lack of enthusiasm in chasing stocks, and some are just thinking about moving to the sidelines after the roller-coaster ride we’ve had since the start of the year,” said Guillaume Dumans, co-head of research firm 2Bremans.

The U.S. Treasury market was muted, with the 10-year yield slightly higher to 2.80 percent, falling 5/32 in price. The activity in credit markets was focused on the municipal sector, where the island of Puerto Rico sold $3.5 billion in debt to shore up its struggling finances. The bonds sold at an 8 percent coupon with a yield of 8.727 percent, levels much less expensive than expected in that market.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 37.28 points or 0.23 percent, to 16,455.96, the S&P 500 gained 4.84 points or 0.26 percent, to 1,882.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.418 points or 0.45 percent, to 4,353.866.

Economic figures were limited on Tuesday. A sharp fall in wholesale sales surprised investors and led to a buildup in inventories in January, particularly in autos and machinery stocks. Wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent. This is a positive for first-quarter growth, though economists expect the weak sales figure to be reversed.

The euro fell against the dollar and the yen on Tuesday after European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Vitor Constancio told investors that they may have missed the message on policy that rates are set to remain accommodative for some time to come.

Strong trade data from Germany, the region’s economic powerhouse, helped the country’s DAX index outperform, as it rose 0.9 percent.

“Recent events, especially concerning Russia and Turkey, have made the outlook less certain, and their impact will only be felt in a few months from now,” said Markus Huber, a senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black.

Tensions over Ukraine continued to build on Tuesday. With diplomacy at a standstill, Ukraine’s acting president announced the formation of a volunteer national guard, while ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich insisted he remained the country’s legitimate leader.

Turkish assets have been hit by political scandals and a power struggle between Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and a U.S.-based Muslim cleric.

Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar edged higher by late morning to trade up 0.01 percent.

Gold extended early gains as Ukraine strengthened the bid in that market. The yellow metal was at $1,349 an ounce. In a sign of the recent jump in demand, the world’s biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month on Monday.

Brent crude, Europe’s regional benchmark, edged up 9 cents to $108.17 a barrel, while U.S. oil slipped 38 cents to $100.74.###3494||Empty###3495||For over a year, I've been paying for my daily grande iced decaf Americano with two pumps of classic syrup at Starbucks with my iPhone. The coffees hop launched a mobile app for U.S. consumers in January 2011, and in 2012 rolled out the app to customers in the UK and Canada, which allows Starbucks customers to pay for coffee (as well as pastries, sandwiches, and other treats) with only our mobile devices. Unfortunately, until now there has been no way to tip baristas using the app - a feature both baristas and customers have been asking for, as these customers often don't have their actual wallet (or at least any cash) with them when buying coffee.

Next week, however, Starbucks will be updating their iOS app in the U.S. to allow customers to leave baristas a tip ranging from 50 cents to $2. Starting March 19, customers can update the app to receive the option to tip via a push notification sent to their iPhone a few minutes after paying at the register and then will have a two-hour window to decide to change the tip (just in case that Americano really hit the spot.) While only U.S. customers will be able to tip digitally for now, a spokesperson from Starbucks says "we’re looking forward to bringing digital tipping to other markets in the coming months."

Chief Digital Officer Adam Brotman said customers have been requesting a tipping feature for the app for some time. “We think it’s going to be great for our baristas,” he said at Starbucks headquarters on Tuesday.

With more than 10 million active app users, Starbucks processes over 11 percent of its transactions using mobile apps, which translates to 5 million every week. At an analyst conference Tuesday, chief operating officer Troy Alstead said that Starbucks is the largest mobile-payments retailer in the U.S. “and, we think, around the world.”

With these numbers, the ability to tip baristas using mobile devices will ultimately lend to a better experience for customers. As mobile users will be more inclined to tip with a mobile wallet (which carries less psychological guilt for throwing down an extra dollar or two as you can't see or touch it), baristas will likely see a huge spike in tips. As Brotman said, the new feature will be great for baristas - the increase in tips will likely increase morale for the baristas, which will only create an even better experience for both those who make stopping by Starbucks a daily habit, and also the customers who make it an occasional treat.

It's a small feature, but it's one that will undoubtedly go a long way into shaping the future of Starbucks culture - in more ways than one.###3496||Empty###3497||BITCOIN exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 DDoS attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.

MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with about 100,000 units the company owned.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $US40 a coin in late 2012 and $US1100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.###3498||Empty###3499||Empty###3500||Get the latest stock market and investment news, market wraps, promotions and more!

On Mar 9, 2009, the S&P 500 index touched a low of 676.13; it’s up 177% since then.

The average length of bull markets since 1921 is 62 months, while average gains are 180%. On the other hand, median gain and length are just 115% and 50 months respectively.

Last bull market ended days after it turned five in October 2007. But according to Capital IQ, bull markets have added another 26% gain if they survived for another year after their fifth anniversary.

Most investors expect the market to go up this year and the path of least resistance for US equities is still up, even though this bull market has been the second strongest since World War II (chart from WSJ).

But can this ageing bull maintain its momentum? Are you turning cautious now?

Zacks Investment Research###3502||Carl Icahn has again posted an open letter on his website, Shareholders’ Square Table, about eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the ongoing conflicts of interest he sees with the company’s board members. He said he has uncovered new evidence which he says makes his assertion that shareholders lost billions on the Skype deal indisputable.

Skype sale resulted in eBay shareholders losing

The activist investor blames CEO John Donahoe for overseeing “a premature sale of Skype at a diminsted price,” which he says resulted in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders losing more than $4 billion compared with how much Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid for the VoIP service provider. Icahn believes Donahoe would be fired if eBay was a private company and the “facts” about this were disclosed.

Donahoe decided in 2009 to sell Skype after receiving offers from “multiple bidders.” Icahn isn’t sure whether there were “multiple bidders,” which eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) originally said or whether the company contacted a number of buyers, which the auction site now claims. The activist investor believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was “clearly interested in buying Skype but ‘walked away’ because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Sky’e founders.”

Icahn uncovers new documents

Icahn said they discovered new litigation documents in which Donahoe and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) board member Marc Andreessen learned about a workaround of the licensed technology which caused Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to walk away. He states that Andreessen bought a controlling interest in Skype at that point for $1.9 billion, then settled the licensing litigation and “flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion—tripling their money in only 18 months.” The activist investor questions why Donahoe didn’t settle the issue and then just sell Skype directly to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

He then made the case for why PayPal should be separated from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), suggesting that there would be “a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal” and that if the payment services provider is left under eBay’s management, then it could “wither,” like BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) (TSE:BB), Dell, Nintendo and other technology companies.

eBay launches its own website

Donahoe has maintained that they should keep PayPal as a subsidiary, and his company launched a website—bettertogether.ebayinc.com—which puts forth his case for why the two companies should remain together. On the site, the company states that PayPal has grown faster with the auction site and that it generates about 30% of PayPal’s new users. The company also states that the auction site speeds up PayPal’s success and makes it “smarter.” In addition, it states that it funds the services provider’s growth.###3503||A North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea on Tuesday, MPs said.

The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

The central government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

But members of the General National Congress, Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow," one GNC member said.

Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

The Morning Glory's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Gathafi.

In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as regionalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.

There have been almost daily attacks on security and other government personnel in the region's main towns.

Former rebels calling for the restoration of the autonomy that Cyrenaica enjoyed for the first 12 years after Libyan independence in 1951, seized control of eastern export terminals last July.

They have made several attempts to export crude through their own oil company but the Morning Glory is the first to have successfully taken on crude.

"We are not demanding the breakup of the country," the head of the federalists' self-declared autonomous government, Abdrabbuh al-Barassi, said on Saturday.

"The oil revenues would be split between the three autonomous regions," he said, promising that all sales would be carried out with complete transparency.

But Washington said on Sunday that it was "deeply concerned" over the loading of "illicitly obtained" oil.

"This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

"The oil belongs to the Libyan National Oil Company and its joint venture partners."

Warships had deployed to block the Morning Glory after Culture Minister Amin al-Habib warned on Sunday the tanker would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it tried to leave port.

The GNC said a task force composed of both regular troops and ex-rebel militia was being formed to bring the rebel ports back under central government control within a week.

But analysts warned that any resort to force risked plunging Libya back into civil war and wreaking major damage to the country's key oil infrastructure.

The standoff between the Tripoli authorities and the eastern rebels has already slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.

The simmering tensions in Libya helped push up oil markets Tuesday with New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in April, gaining 19 cents to $101.31 a barrel.

"Libya continues to support prices as well, with the threat to sink a North Korean tanker if it loads oil from a rebel held port being taken seriously in the markets," said analyst Joe Conlan at energy consultancy Inenco.###3504||Empty###3505||Empty###3506||Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, pledged to appoint a new Deputy Governor at the Bank to lead a "root and branch" review of its strategy, after suspending an official over the foreign exchange market manipulation scandal.

Carney claimed that there was "no evidence" any Bank of England official had condoned manipulation of the foreign exchange market, as he faced down tough questioning from U.K. members of parliament (MPs).

He defended the Bank against MPs' suggestions it should have been more alert to the possibility of foreign exchange market manipulations, after the matter was raised as part of regular meetings between the Bank and market participants, some of whom have since been arrested over the scandal.

"It is possible foreign exchange traders decided to collude to make their lives easier and richer," Carney said.

In a move likely to have ramifications for the central bank's history, he signaled that he is prepared to make the 420 year-old Bank a more open institution.

Parliament's Treasury Select Committee quizzed Carney and the bank's Executive Director of Markets Paul Fisher about allegations that bank officials condoned or were informed of manipulation in the foreign exchange market or the sharing of confidential client information.



Carney told them: "This is as serious as Libor, if not more so" and that this was an "unhappy situation" after one of them accused him of being "relaxed" about the alleged manipulations. However, he added that he expects that the investigation will "re-confirm" the integrity of Bank employees.###3507||The situation in Ukraine and Crimea is ugly, complicated, and disturbing. It's moving to see the Ukrainian people fight for a more free and open society, even as Russia looks to be breaking international laws and muscling in on Crimea -- which has been part of Ukraine for more than 60 years. While I don't think it's fair for me -- or 99% of Americans -- to weigh in on what should happen, beyond letting the people of Crimea -- all of them, not just ethnic Russians -- have a voice in their destiny, the fact is, whatever happens will probably have far-reaching implications even here in America.

One only has to look at two companies tied to the natural gas transportation business to see the potential for harm. Both Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS) and Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) are set up to lose if Russia keeps down a path that leads to international sanctions.

Just getting traction in a huge market

Last May, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issued a decree to convert 50% of public transit and fleet vehicles in cities of more than 1 million people to natural gas by 2020. This amounts to potentially hundreds of thousands of natural-gas vehicles, including taxis, buses, and other support vehicles used in fleets. Not only does Russia hold some of the world's largest natural-gas reserves, it has very few natural gas refueling stations -- only around 200 or so -- in place to support new vehicles.

Clean Energy Fuels announced a partnership with Russian Machines Corp just last month, naming the company as exclusive distributor and service provider of its IMW brand of compressors and compressor-filling systems in Russia. The two companies already work together in six other countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

For Chart Industries, the company has just attained GOST R certification (a Russian government standard) for its LNG vehicle-fuel systems, meaning it would have access to this massive market as well. In addition to vehicle-fuel systems, Chart has plans to sell its permanent and mobile refueling stations as well as its L/CNG refueling systems in Russia in the near future.

Sanctions coming?



The risk, of course, is potential economic sanctions. If the situation around Crimea and Ukraine continues, economic sanctions would likely exclude or limit American businesses from doing business in Russia. The anti-U.S. backlash from Russians, if indeed sanctions of any kind to occur, could very well limit business dealings -- no matter what the eventual outcome is. The thing is, Russia has Europe over a barrel -- or more accurately, over a natural-gas pipeline, so it's really hard to say what, exactly, will happen. But the risk is very real.

What's the opportunity?

One only has to look at Chart's strong business growth in China in recent years to see the potential for the Russian market. In 2013, Chart signed one deal with PetroChina alone that was worth $50 million and announced an $80 million expansion of its manufacturing facility in the country that will double production capacity when complete. The Asian market is simply massive; Chart's Distribution and Storage business grew 66% in Asia last year. Russia should be a significant part of Chart's growth in Asia for years to come.





For Clean Energy Fuels, CEO Andrew Littlefair wouldn't project any numbers for the deal with Russian Machines. But the IMW deal in 2013 with China Gas should give some indication: That deal called for as many as 416 compressors at 310 stations and could amount to $150 million in revenue over three years. Considering Clean Energy did around $350 million in total sales in 2013, $50 million per year is a significant amount of upside. The deal with Russian Machines could offer similar potential. The possibility of sanctions alters that potential in a real way.

Final thoughts: Human lives are at stake and this matters more right now

Let me be clear about one thing: The loss of any upside for these companies pales in comparison to the potential for armed conflict and loss of lives should this situation escalate. But investors should at least keep an eye on this and be aware that there could be impacts -- if not to the near-term potential -- to the opportunity for these companies to expand into the Russian market. While it will have limited impact in 2014 no matter what happens, it's a reminder how conflicts a world away can impact us in ways we don't expect.###3508||President Barack Obama wants to eliminate, as part of his proposed fiscal year 2015 budget, aggressive Social Security claiming strategies “which allow upper-income beneficiaries to manipulate the timing of collection of Social Security benefits to maximize delayed retirement credits.”

Now, that plan to stop upper-income beneficiaries from claiming and then suspending their Social Security benefit may or may not become a reality. But what remains a reality, at least for now, is this: The incentive for waiting to claim Social Security until age 70.

And that incentive, according to a series of just-released fact sheets and the like from National Association of Social Insurance, is significant.

Consider: If you claim Social Security at age 62 you’ll get just 75% of the monthly benefit you would have received had you waited until full retirement age. But if you wait until age 70, you’ll get 132% of what would have been your full retirement age benefit. Or put another way, if your full retirement age benefit is $1,000 a month, you’d get just $750 a month if you claim at age 62, or $1,320 if you wait until age 70.

The decision about when to claim Social Security decision is, for most people, not an easy one. To do it right, you need to consider many factors and answer many questions, some of which are, frankly, unanswerable.

What are some of those factors and questions? Well, the NASI addressed many of the factors and questions in its just-released tool kit, Social Security: It Pays to Wait, which includes, a three-minute video: Social Security: It Pays To Wait; a one-page fact sheet, When Should I Take Social Security?; and a 16-page brief, When Should I Take Social Security? Questions to Consider.

To be sure, it’s well worth reading and studying the NASI’s tool kit. It’s also worth learning what experts participating in an email discussion had to say about the NASI’s tool kit and what they think beneficiaries need to consider before taking Social Security.

1. Take it seriously

First, what’s especially difficult about the when-to-claim-Social Security decision is that you have to decide what to do early in your 60s, long before you know the answers to your questions about your health and life expectancy. And two, the decision is irrevocable.

“Unfortunately, some decisions have to be made early in the game, such as the decision about when to take Social Security, or what option to take from the defined benefit plan, and once made, are generally irrevocable,” said Chuck Yanikoski, the president of Still River Retirement Planning Software and RetirementWORKS.

“Other decisions can be put off, or modified, but once made limit one’s future choices. So the further a person gets into retirement, the fewer options they have — and not only because of past decisions that they can’t take back, but because of declining health, fewer or no opportunities for re-employment, possibly declining asset balances, and generally no likelihood of other new sources of income or assets.”

Yes, there’s a continuing need to reassess and modify your plan as things change during retirement, but that cannot be an excuse for not doing the best possible job at retirement, Yanikoski said.

“Planning around the time of retirement has a much bigger impact than individual course corrections during retirement, so it is best to do that planning as if you were only going to get one shot at it,” Yanikoski said.

2. Don’t use your break-even age

Advisers sometimes suggest, as part of the process, that you ought to determine the age at which you would come out ahead if you delay Social Security. In other words, the experts want you to determine your break-even age.

Now the break-even age, according to an analysis by Rande Spiegelman, a vice president of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, depends on the amount of your benefits and the assumptions you use to account for taxes and the opportunity cost of waiting.

In his analysis, Spiegelman calculated the break-even ages for a top wage earner turning 62 in 2013 with monthly benefits (in 2013 dollars) at ages 62 and one month of $1,923; 66, $2,591; and 70, $3,447. And what he found was this: The break-even age is between:

77 and 78 for the top wage earner deciding whether to take Social Security early at age 62 vs. at age 66, the full retirement age (FRA);

80 and 81 for those deciding whether to take Social Security early at age 62 or at age 70; and

83 and 84 for those deciding whether to take Social Security at FRA vs. at age 70.

Read When Should You Take Social Security?

Research, however, shows the Social Security Administration’s historical use of “break-even analysis” has the effect of inducing individuals to retire early, according to Jeff Brown, a professor at the University of Illinois.

Read Framing effects and expected social security claiming behavior, which is research Brown conducted with Arie Kapteyn, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. and Olivia Mitchell, a professor at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

So instead of using a break-even analysis, Brown recommends using “alternative frames,” much more in the spirit of how the NASI does this in its toolkit. That sort of framing, he said, increases intended claiming ages by 18 to 24 months.

Indeed, in its tool kit, the NASI suggests that older Americans consider not their break-even age, but their life expectancy when deciding when to take Social Security. For instance, the NASI notes that an average 65-year-old male can expect to live 19 more years, to age 84, while an average 65-year-old female can expect to live about 22 more years, to age 87. In addition, the NASI suggests that nearly four in 10 women and three in 10 men age 65 today can expect to reach age 90.

3. Focus more on longevity risk

Brown, however, suggest that those trying to decide when to claim Social Security focus less on average life expectancy and more on the odds of living a long time. “My concern about focusing on life expectancy rather than the full distribution of longevity possibilities is that one could inadvertently put people back into the mind-set of thinking in terms of break-even dates, rather than thinking about the sustainability of consumption,” said Brown. “Indeed, one of my pet peeves about financial planners (and financial planning software) is that they rarely discuss longevity ‘risk’ as opposed to average life expectancy.”

Said Brown: “An arbitrary extension of life expectancy ‘to be conservative’ is not a substitute for a fulsome discussion of longevity risk. If one does not explicitly consider the risk around average life expectancy, then one will never see why an annuity is an appropriate solution. It would be like trying to sell fire insurance, but instead of discussing the risk that your house will burn down, you only point out that on average 1% of everyone’s house will burn once a year.”

Others, however, have a different point of view. The Social Security decision is significantly different from some other longevity issues,” said Yanikoski. “Financial planners need to look at extra-long life scenarios, because they are, usually, trying to figure out how to amortize savings — and obviously, a planned amortization using life expectancy leaves 50% of people in a catastrophe.”

Social Security isn’t like that, he said. “None of the choices leads to a catastrophic outcome, regardless of what happens,” Yanikoski said. “So with Social Security the task is not to avoid catastrophe, but to optimize the chance of getting the best result. And the way to do that is to plan around the most likely longevity outcome.”

4. Consider personalized life expectancy

Other experts, meanwhile, say factoring life expectancy into the Social Security-claiming decision is important, but that it needs to be personalized. “What is conspicuously absent, however, is that many people, roughly 50%, do not live to their life expectancy or longer,” said Steve Mitchell, a consultant Oculus Partners and founder of Stephen W. Mitchell & Associates. “The important question that every potential beneficiary should ask that is totally missing from the discussion and most of our industry discussion on outliving retirement income is whether or not the overall average life expectancy is a good estimate of personal life expectancy, or are their personal health or family history factors that should be factored into the individual’s decision.”

According to Mitchell, an important step for most considering the Social Security decision is to use a tool to estimate a “personal” life expectancy such as that found at the Living to 100 Life Expectancy Calculator. “At best, it’s still just an estimate, but better than making a big financial decision based on broad population averages,” he said.

In many cases, for those in good health, who don’t smoke and who have good family history, Mitchell said calculating your personal life expectancy will reinforce the key message that you may live longer than you expect and Social Security becomes an increasingly important source of income as you get older. However, for others who are in poor health, and who have family history of premature death, and the like, Mitchell said the considerations are different. “Of course for married couples, both spouses’ expectancy need to be considered and some of the more complex Social Security claiming strategies may provide significant benefits,” Mitchell said.

The exercise of creating a personalized life expectancy is a worthwhile one, but one shouldn’t go overboard. In his practice, for instance, Yanikoski considers only sex, smoking status, and a five-level self-evaluation of current factors health.

Of course, it’s possible that pushing people to claim at age 70 might not be in their best interest. “I think that it usually is not prudent to use exaggerated life expectancies to make Social Security decisions,” said Yanikoski. “Although it seems ‘conservative’ in terms of longevity risk, pushing Social Security claiming toward age 70 severely reduces short-term income in exchange for potential very-long-term future gains.”

For people of modest financial means, Yanikoski said this is paying a big premium up front for the hope of future benefits, even when that hope is against the odds, to the extent they assume longer-than-normal life expectancy. “In my view, this is not conservative; it’s risky and fundamentally imprudent gambling,” he said. “I don’t think we should be encouraging it.”

5. Stay flexible

Others, meanwhile, remind us that retirement planning is not a once-and-done exercise. “Retirement-income planning is not static and is not a one-time decision,” said Diane Savage, a certified financial planner and educator. “It requires attention throughout retirement with many course adjustments, if you will.”

“So many of the factors related to retirement-income management are not controllable even though we like to think they are,” she said. “It appears to me that there are many attempts to create certainty around something that is far from certain.”

The best plans, she said, are those that provide some guaranteed income sources as well as other income sources that can adapt and move with forces beyond the control of the retiree. “This is the most appropriate path to provide more certainty for the retirement-income stream,” said Savage. “The best advice someone planning their retirement income can be given is be prepared to be flexible.”

Hedged dividend investing for retirement###3509||Several U.S. institutional investors said they are closely monitoring the developments at Pimco, the world’s largest bond firm, in the wake of Mohamed El-Erian’s abrupt resignation as CEO and ensuing acrimony between him and co-founder Bill Gross.

[np_storybar title=”Pimco’s got bigger problems than the soap opera we’ve been reading about lately” link=”https://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/08/pimcos-got-bigger-problems-than-the-soap-opera-weve-been-reading-about-lately/”%5DSince reports of Bill Gross’ issues with co-CEO Mohamed El-Erian surfaced last month, it seems like the media has made it its mission to air Pimco’s dirty laundry. Take a look behind the curtain to see what’s going on at the world’s biggest bond fund.

[/np_storybar]

The investors, including retirement systems, have formally put Pimco on “watch lists,” a signal that they will keep a much closer eye its performance than usual. It could eventually lead to reductions in the amount of money they allocate to funds at the firm, whose full name is Pacific Investment Management Co and which has $1.91 trillion in assets.

“We intend to go out and meet with them over the course of the next month,” said David Hunter, chief investment officer of the North Dakota State Investment Board. The board, which has about $400 million invested with Pimco, put the fund on its watch list on February 28.

Hunter said the board could ultimately decide not to make any changes to its allocation.

The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, said it had not placed Pimco on a formal watch list, but it was also paying close attention to developments.

“CalPERS staff has tremendous respect for the staff at Pimco,” the system said in an emailed statement. “That being said, we are monitoring the issue and will keep our board aware of the changes.”

In a statement, Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge said: “We are focused on communication with our clients, and have been in regular contact with them following the recent leadership transition. They understand the changes we have taken and why, and are ready to move forward with us.”

In a Tweet on Monday, Gross wrote:

Gross: No distractions here — just long term performance satisfaction — working hard as always for clients. — PIMCO (@PIMCO) March 10, 2014

The closer scrutiny by state and local pension systems shows that Gross, though, may have more work to do to assuage investor concerns after El-Erian’s surprise departure and reports of growing discord between the two men amid weak fund performance.

Overall, customers withdrew $41.1 billion from Pimco’s flagship Total Return Fund last year, a record amount for the manager, according to investment research firm Morningstar. The fund posted another $1.6 billion in outflows in February, reducing assets to $236 billion and marking the 10th straight month of outflows.

The Total Return Fund, which Gross manages, trailed more than 70 percent of its peers in February.

Last month, a Wall Street Journal article described the worsening relationship between the two men as Pimco’s performance deteriorated. Later, Gross told Reuters that El-Erian, who is due to leave the firm in less than a week, was trying to “undermine” him by talking to the Journal.

A memo from investment consultant NEPC to the City of Fresno Retirement System Joint Boards noted “an elevated level of concern” around the changes at Pimco.

It was clear that there was a profound sense of disappointment and surprise within Pimco regarding El-Erian’s departure

During a recent on-site visit to the bond firm’s offices, “it was clear that there was a profound sense of disappointment and surprise within Pimco regarding Mr. El-Erian’s departure,” the memo said, adding: “Mr. Gross viewed Mr. El-Erian as his successor and during the meeting he expressed a level of sadness and frustration regarding the resignation.”

The Fresno systems were already weighing investing with Pimco when news of El-Erian’s departure, as well as other staff changes, came out. When the city wanted reassurance on organizational questions, Pimco sent a team to the Fresno offices.

The Fresno systems are now negotiating with Pimco and expect to invest money with the firm in coming months.

“You’re talking a lot of depth (of the bench). It’s not driven by two people,” said Stanley McDivitt, the systems’ retirement administrator.

Other investors said they were not in a rush to make changes to their allocations.

The Florida State Board of Administration spokesman Dennis MacKee said it placed Pimco on its watch list as a routine procedure, which it followed for any firm that was undergoing management shifts.

The Florida board has about $1.7 billion in its pension fund at Pimco and about $240 million from its defined contribution plan with the firm.

“We think of our watch list as just enhanced oversight. You look a little deeper,” MacKee said.

Neil Rue, a managing director at Pension Consulting Alliance, said it was too early to make any decisions about how these changes might affect Pimco’s performance.

“On the fixed income front, we told our clients don’t take any major action, but we need to watch this closely,” Rue said.

If Pimco’s style remains consistent, given Gross’ strong track record over many years, there may be no changes recommended, Rue added.

R. T. Jones Capital Equities Management Inc Chief Investment Officer Steve Davis said his fund pulled out $100 million from Pimco Total Return Fund last year because of a desire to reduce duration exposure and interest rate risk, but he would consider returning to the bond giant in the future.

“Nor do we think the internal turmoil will negatively affect the performance of the fund. In fact, we don’t rule out using the fund again in the future,” Davis said. “We have very high respect for Bill Gross and his team at Pimco.”

© Thomson Reuters 2014###3510||Failed Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is allowing users to log in to their accounts once again, nearly three weeks after it filed for bankruptcy protection.

Some users reported seeing accurate balances, but on various forums, users were, however, concerned that the exchange’s website had been hacked and the new login facility on the site may be a hoax.

“We believe this is an authentic notice on the website and we are confirming with the legal team,” a call center staffer said on Tuesday.

Another staffer had earlier said that she was unable to say whether the reactivated login was the result of an order by the Tokyo District Court, adding the database cannot be accessed while the case is being investigated by the court. Lawyers for Mt. Gox could not immediately be reached.

Tim Hornyak

The notice on the website, which was said to have been posted Tuesday by the call center, invited users to log in to check their Bitcoin wallet balances. It’s the first access since the Tokyo-based exchange went offline Feb. 25 and later announced it had lost some 850,000 bitcoins.

Some users noted that the reopened access only confirms what they knew before the exchange’s meltdown and that their coins remain in limbo.

“The site shows the coins, but it indicates it has no real meaning with respect to claims,” said Aaron G., an investor who did not want his last name to be used. His balance indicates about 464 bitcoins (roughly $286,700 according to average bitcoin prices on other exchanges).

“So, just numbers on a screen—just as ‘real’ as they were before Gox went down,” he said in an email interview.

Aaron, who filed a fraud complaint against the exchange with Tokyo police, was referring to the legalese on the page citing Mt. Gox’s pending status under Japan’s Civil Rehabilitation Act.

“Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users,” the exchange said on its website.

“I can see the 10k Mtgox stole from me... hooray!” a Reddit user posted in reaction to the reactivation of the login.

The Mt. Gox website said it will post a method for filing claims as soon as it is in a position to do so, without providing details.

The move follows the exchange’s filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28 with liabilities of ¥6.5 billion ($63.6 million), when it said 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins were missing, along with 100,000 of its own. Users were left wondering whether they will ever get their bitcoins back.

The rehabilitation procedure is one of several legal actions involving Mt. Gox and its parent company Tibanne, led by Mark Karpeles. Last week a U.S. district court judge ordered a freeze of the assets of Karpeles as well as Tibanne and Mt. Gox’s U.S. subsidiary amid allegations of fraud.

Gregory Greene filed the Chicago lawsuit against Mt. Gox on Feb. 27, alleging he lost around $25,000 worth of bitcoins in the exchange’s meltdown.###3511||Empty###3512||Italian banking giant UniCredit SpA (UNCFF.PK) on Tuesday reported a loss for the fourth quarter that widened from last year, reflecting a hefty goodwill impairment and additional loan loss provisions.

UniCredit's board of directors approved the company's new 2013-18 strategic plan, targeting a net profit of about 2 billion euros in 2014 that is expected to more than triple to 6.6 billion euros in 2018.

UniCredit's net loss for the fourth quarter widened to 14.98 billion euros or $20.78 billion, from 553 million euros in the year-ago period.

The company attributed the wider loss to one-time items, driven by revised macroeconomic assumptions and a tougher regulatory framework.

The latest quarter's results include impairment of goodwill and customer relationships of 9.3 billion euros, leading to the full write down of the goodwill allocated to Italy, CEE and Austria. The company noted that the remaining goodwill on its balance sheet of 3.5 billion euros was broadly in line with its 2004 level.

UniCredit also recorded additional loan loss provisions of 7.2 billion euros, leading to total loan loss provisions of 9.3 billion euros in the quarter. In addition, the company incurred restructuring costs of 699 million euros in the quarter.

However, total revenues for the quarter grew 5 percent to 5.98 billion euros from 5.68 billion euros in the year-ago period.

Net interest income for the quarter edged up less than 1 percent from the year-ago period to 3.26 billion euros, reflecting continuous re-pricing on deposits.

Meanwhile, commissions and fees rose 2 percent to 1.96 billion euros, aided by growth in investment service fees as well as financing service fees. Trading income surged 96 percent to 643 million euros, benefiting from gains on the sale of non-core equity investments.

Operating costs for the quarter rose 7 percent from the year-ago period to 3.88 billion euros.

Net write-downs on loans and provisions for guarantees and commitments more than doubled from last year to 9.34 billion euros, while provisions for risk and charges rose almost twelve-fold to 522 million euros.

UniCredit's assets under management or AUM were equal to 173.9 billion euros as at December 2013.

At the end of the fourth quarter, the company's Core Tier 1 ratio was equal to 11.11 percent, down from 11.44 percent in the same period last year.

UniCredit said that at the annual general meeting on May 13, 2014, its board of directors will propose a distribution of 10 eurocents per share for the financial year 2013, to be paid out of reserves of profits through a newly issued shares assignment.

However, upon shareholders' request, the company will make cash payment. The ex-dividend date has been set on May 19, 2014, with the record date May 21, 2014 and payment date on June 6, 2014.

UniCredit also announced the launch of its new 2013-18 strategic plan. The plan envisages reporting of the Italian non-core portfolio that is expected to be reduced by 63 percent in 2018.

Federico Ghizzoni, CEO of UniCredit said, "Whilst in 2014 we estimate a net profit around €2 billion, we intend to more than triple this to €6.6 billion in 2018, with an ROTE target of 13 per cent. We are also planning to invest €4.5 billion to grow revenues and to cut an additional €1.3 billion out of our cost base."

UniCredit said it has decided to make an initial public offering of Fineco during 2014 in order to accelerate its growth and enhance its market visibility, whilst optimizing capital allocation within the Group.

On the Milan Stock Exchange, UniCredit shares are currently trading at 6.40 euros, up 0.36 or 5.96 percent on a volume of 184.55 million shares.

Libya's National Oil Corp. said Monday the tanker Morning Glory had taken on a load of crude oil illegally from Sidra, a port under rebel control in eastern Libya. Omar Hemidan, a spokesman for the General National Congress, confirmed to the Libya Herald the tanker was intercepted and was on its way to the port at Misurata.

Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen's first news conference as Fed chair.

The Associated Press

WASHINGTON � The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts. Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen's first news conference as Fed chair.

The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.

Will Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke's approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed's economic stimulus?

Or, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?

No major announcements are expected when the meeting ends Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.



�

The Fed's most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows "well past" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5 percent threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.

Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there's "not a large expectation" that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.

One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they're no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.

"There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate."

Yellen, who was sworn as chair on Feb. 3, has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That's partly why the Fed will likely announce this week a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage spending and growth.

In December and in January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. If the economy keeps improving, the Fed will likely keep paring its bond purchases until ending them altogether in December.

The pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that's depressed growth, to fears about how Russia's aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.

Still, Fed officials, including Yellen, have signaled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign the economy is losing momentum.

The Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth in 2014. Many think the economy, which grew a lackluster 1.9 percent in 2013, will rebound to around 3 percent this year.

Stocks rally: What you need to know



Major upgrades coming from Apple###3528||BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who is betting $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year on lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to government documents filed in recent weeks.

William Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks at the Partner Connect 2013 conference, sponsored by Thomson Reuters, in Boston April 5, 2013. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss company fought the billionaire investor’s claims it runs a pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the products outside the network.

Ackman’s $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists, data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.

In October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.

The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton, specializes in Latino outreach.

Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities. Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens, which has asked California’s Attorney General to probe Herbalife, echoed the fund manager’s accusations. Herbalife said last month that it does not target members of minorities or low income communities.

The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company’s fate.

In the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut down illegal businesses before.

SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of shareholder activism, said the SEC’s Enforcement Division has previously probed whether statements made about a business are “materially false or misleading, including statements regarding the compensation levels.”

Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife distributors’ testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said distributors results’ depend on time, energy and dedication.

Ackman has forecast that Herbalife’s share price will plummet to zero amid regulators’ scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground however, falling 17 percent.

Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients’ messages to the highest levels in Washington.

The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full service government affairs firm.

During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive Politics.

Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey McGrath, which counted Boeing, Microsoft and Time Warner among its past clients.

IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to Glover Park Group.

Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.

Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this group. California’s Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe Herbalife is a Democrat.###3529||Empty###3530||News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services###3531||Image copyright AP Image caption Mark Carney appeared before the Commons Treasury Select Committee

Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom asked him: "If Scotland votes for independence and joins the EU are you saying that RBS would have to move to the UK, the remaining UK?"

The governor replied: "It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it.

"It depends on their arrangements as well, if they were to adjust more into Scotland the mind and management of the institution."

The BBC's Robert Peston has reported that the relevant European directive, Council Directive 95/26/EC of 29 June 1995, had never been tested in the courts.

Mr Carney also told MPs that any "informal adoption of sterling" by an independent Scotland without a currency union would mean the country losing the lender of last resort facilities of the Bank of England.

No doubt Alex Salmond's response will be the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - Mark Carney is wrong and only the first minister is right Better Together spokesman

Conservative MP David Ruffley asked if the Bank would support RBS and Lloyds if an independent Scotland adopted the pound with no currency union.

Mr Carney told the committee that the bank "can act as lender of last resort to branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks" but it did not have to.

The governor described a currency union as a "political question which the major political parties have ruled out" but added that the Bank of England had "done work on these issues" and "was well appraised of the potential risks".

He said his own speech on the subject in Edinburgh in January, when he talked of countries which are involved in a currency union having to cede some sovereignty, was a "technocratic assessment".

Mr Carney added: "At no time have I said that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union."

I am pleased the governor took this opportunity to confirm the Bank of England's neutrality on the issue of Scottish independence Stewart Hosie, SNP Treasury spokesman

Ms Leadsom asked whether Scotland would have to adopt its own currency before joining the euro, as an alternative to continuing to use the pound.

Mr Carney said it was a matter of "European law" and whether the remainder of the UK without Scotland was regarded as a continuing state in the EU, but said he took the views of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso as a "starting point".

He continued: "Scotland would have to apply to join the European Union [and] that application, as for any new application to join the European Union, would include a commitment to join the euro in the fullness of time."

Mr Barroso has said that it would be "extremely difficult" for an independent Scotland to join the EU, a claim the Scottish government has described as "pretty preposterous".

Voters in Scotland will decide whether it should be an independent country in a referendum on 18 September.

Best option

A spokesman for the pro-Union Better Together campaign said: "What people in Scotland need is clarity from Alex Salmond about his Plan B for what would replace the pound.

"Would we have to sign up to the euro, as Mark Carney said, or would we set up an unproven separate currency?

"No doubt Alex Salmond's response will be the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - Mark Carney is wrong and only the first minister is right. It simply isn't credible."

SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie, a member of the committee, said: "I am pleased the governor took this opportunity to confirm the Bank of England's neutrality on the issue of Scottish independence, and that his Edinburgh speech was a technical assessment of currency unions, not a judgment on independence.

"Mark Carney was clear that the issue he wanted to get across was the nature of the stability arrangements which are required for the formation of a successful currency union.

"I am pleased that the Scottish government's Fiscal Commission Working Group have described in detail a blueprint for such a successful currency union."

The group, chaired by economist Crawford Beveridge, recently reiterated its view that a formal currency union was the best option for an independent Scotland, saying it had "clear advantages for the rest of the UK".

The terrorist attack in Kunming left at least 29 dead and more than 130 wounded. Now, the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 inevitably has made the situation more anxious.

As hours turn into days, a multinational rescue team has started searching for the missing plane. According to China Daily (Chinese), as of March 9, 11 countries have joined in an international search and rescue operation after this flight mysteriously disappeared from radar. China Daily says vessels and aircraft in this international rescue operation come from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain. The 239 people on board, including 227 passengers, are from 11 different countries, according to a Malaysia Airlines press briefing. 154 of the missing passengers are Chinese, including one from Taiwan. There are no citizens from Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines, aboard the missing plane, but all four countries are close to the incident site and have joined the search efforts. Other countries, such as Britain, participated in the search for MH370 despite not having any citizens involved and a large geographical distance.

There are no Japanese citizens on MH370, and given the current situation on East China Sea, Japan certainly has no obligation to join the rescue. However, Japan has the most advanced technology and facility in Asia-Pacific region, highly trained rescue personnel, and extensive experiences in disaster management. So what if Japan had volunteered to join the MH370 international rescue operation?

China has been closely watching Japan’s overseas operations. If a Japanese civilian rescue team participated in the search, would Beijing regard it as at least a positive and friendly gesture in the enduring Sino-Japanese standoff? Such a gesture might just help to promote bilateral dialogues and ease the tensions that have been created by historical and territorial disputes. Both China and Japan did enjoy a symbolic friendship when then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Japan’s earthquake-hit area on May 21, 2011 “to convey the Chinese people’s sympathies for the local people and to demonstrate China’s support for Japan’s reconstruction efforts.” However, the Sino-Japanese relationship hit the rocks again in 2012 after this period of brief amity.

The Sino-Japanese bilateral relationship has reached a deadlock and there seems to be no panacea for this conundrum in the near future. Under these circumstances, more indirect approaches might help to make some changes, if not outright diplomatic achievements. Such indirect actions could simply serve to send intended messages, especially at a time when high-level inter-governmental channels have basically failed. One such notable case, reported by media from both countries, took place in mid-November 2013, when the Japanese government recognized a Chinese student for saving a Japanese boy from drowning.

Unfortunately, that moment was just a flash in the pan, and reconciliation between these two neighbors is still nowhere to be seen. According to Xinhua (Chinese), on February 28, Japan’s Foreign Ministry held a meeting with Japan’s 30 ambassadors to Asia-Pacific countries such as China, South Korea, and Australia. The Foreign Ministry urged the ambassadors to “defeat the opposite side [China] by substantially utilizing their personal charm and hit hard on those governments.” Obviously, Japan’s Foreign Ministry intends to fight back against China’s previous round of public diplomacy in global media.

However, a spiraling escalation of confrontation ultimately is not what can help to solve territorial disputes, especially between China and Japan, both of which are giant economies with growing military capability. At this moment when war preparations seem to appear in both countries, it is critically urgent to find all possible opportunities to take a step back and to give each country a way out. It may not be another award for a notable deed, but could be something more emotionally and intuitively acceptable and thus helpful to ease the bilateral confrontation. Both China and Japan should find or create these opportunities.###3534||Image copyright AFP Image caption Candy Crush Saga is King's most popular game and the biggest contributor to its revenue

King, the games developer behind Candy Crush Saga, is looking to raise as much as $533m (£321m) via a share sale on the New York Stock Exchange.

The firm said it is planning to sell 22.2 million shares, priced between $21 and $24 per share.

That could value the company at almost $7.6bn at the top of its pricing range.

King's portfolio includes more than 180 games, but Candy Crush is its most popular offering and was the most downloaded free mobile app of 2013.

It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012.

Over-reliance?

A small number of games currently generate a substantial majority of our revenue King

The popularity of Candy Crush has been the biggest driver of growth for King during the past two years.

Before Candy Crush, in 2011, King took $64m in revenue.

Two years later, and after the Candy Crush mania had well and truly taken hold, it had sales of more than $1.8bn

However, there have been concerns that the firm relies too heavily on Candy Crush and that if its popularity faded, the company's revenue and profits may be hit.

King has acknowledged this in its filing with the US securities regulator.

"A small number of games currently generate a substantial majority of our revenue," it said.

According to the firm, its top three games - Candy Crush Saga, Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga - accounted for 95% of its total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013.

King said that if these games become less popular, and it is unable to offset that with sales from other games, it will not be able to maintain or grow its revenue and "our financial results could be adversely affected".###3535||Why did this happen?

NEW YORK – Men’s Wearhouse Inc. has agreed to buy smaller rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. for about $1.8 billion in cash, ending a five-month takeover battle between the two menswear retailers.

Both companies’ boards have approved the transaction, the retailers said Tuesday in a statement. Jos. A. Bank also will terminate a separate deal to buy the Eddie Bauer brand and cancel a plan to buy as much as $300 million of its own stock.

Tuesday’s agreement settles a feud Jos. A. Bank began in October with an offer for its larger rival. Men’s Wearhouse turned down that proposal and countered with multiple bids for Jos. A. Bank, all of which were rejected as too low. Jos. A. Bank said it would begin talks with Men’s Wearhouse last month following a sweetened $1.78 billion offer.

“It’s a strong acquisition that is mutually beneficial to both companies and shareholders of both companies,” Mark Montagna, a Nashville, Tenn.-based analyst for Avondale Partners, said in a phone interview.

The combined company will have more than 1,700 U.S. stores and sales of about $3.5 billion on a pro forma basis, the retailers said. Jos. A. Bank can benefit from Men’s Wearhouse’s tuxedo-rental business, while Men’s Wearhouse can learn from Jos. A. Bank’s ability to inexpensively source products, Montagna said.

Jos. A. Bank imperiled the possibility of a tie-up with Men’s Wearhouse in February, when it agreed to buy the Eddie Bauer brand in an $825 million deal that would have created a company too big for its suitor to acquire.

The deal with Men’s Wearhouse will result in as much as $150 million of annual savings realized over three years, the companies said Tuesday. Jos. A. Bank’s approximately 600 stores won’t be rebranded, the companies said.

Jos. A. Bank had been told by five of its largest shareholders to start talking to its rival about a sale, people with knowledge of the matter said in January.

Eminence Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that owns shares in both companies, supported the most recent bid. Eminence Chief Executive Officer Ricky Sandler said in February that the offer represented “a superior alternative” for shareholders over the Eddie Bauer deal.

The $65-a-share purchase price is 56 percent higher than Jos. A. Bank’s closing price on Oct. 8, the day before its offer for Men’s Wearhouse was publicly disclosed.

Men’s Wearhouse had sued Jos. A. Bank, saying it was “economically irrational” for its rival to use the Eddie Bauer deal to fend off a merger. Men’s Wearhouse also accused Jos. A. Bank directors of breaching their fiduciary duties by enacting a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, to make it more difficult for an acquirer to buy the company.

Golden Gate Capital Corp., the San Francisco-based private- equity firm that was selling Eddie Bauer, said it respects Jos. A. Bank’s decision to terminate the deal and is pleased to continue owning the brand.###3537||Empty###3538||Empty###3539||Empty###3540||Empty###3541||Janet Yellen is under pressure from the right to stop quantitative easing and other pro-employment policies. Charles Dharapak/AP Photo

Half a decade after the financial crisis, the Great Recession is still alive and kicking. Thirty million Americans are unemployed or underemployed, and there’s still only one job opening for every three applicants. All this joblessness has put downward pressure on everyone’s wages and reversed years of progress in fighting poverty.

Our government has a moral obligation to end this crisis. As co-founders of the Congressional Full Employment Caucus, we’ve put forth legislation to make needed investments in infrastructure, job training, education and local and state public services to get everyone working, earning a salary and contributing to the tax base.

But House leaders refuse to act. By instead pursuing reckless job-killing budget cuts and dangerous and ineffective deregulation, Congressional Republicans keep making matters worse.

That’s why we just submitted a letter -- signed by 21 members of Congress -- to the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, with a simple message: When Congress fails to help the unemployed, you must help carry the mantle. Chairwoman Yellen has a long history of standing up for working people and a powerful arsenal of economic policies to fight unemployment.

The Fed has a mandate dating back to the Employment Act of 1946 to pursue the goals of “maximum employment, production and purchasing power.” As the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act further clarified in 1978, the Fed is supposed to actively set maximum employment targets and use all its policy levers to achieve a full employment society.

Since the start of the Great Recession, Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke have taken this mandate seriously, pursuing a policy known as quantitative easing to purchase mortgage-backed securities, Treasury bills and other kinds of bonds to lower interest rates and accelerate job creation and economic growth. The Fed, in short, is not only using its most effective tool to fight for jobs; it's quite simply the only powerful economic player in Washington that’s doing what it can to solve the unemployment crisis.

Still, Yellen and her colleagues are facing serious pressure to stop quantitative easing and other pro-employment policies. Some conservatives see such easing as excessive government interference or a potential cause of inflation, even through inflation remains extremely low. Texas Gov. Rick Perry went so far as calling the Fed’s policies “treason” during an Iowa stop on the 2012 primary campaign trail.

If conservatives truly believe that Fed actions amount to “treason,” we have some good news for them. Republicans can end any disagreeable Fed policies any time. All they have to do is pass a serious jobs bill in Congress.

As prominent Republican economist Martin Feldstein argued in the New York Times recently, the Fed would be free to end its quantitative easing if Congress enacted a serious jobs agenda. There’s no shortage of fiscally responsible legislative options to create jobs. The Congressional Progressive Caucus’s “Better Off Budget,” released this week, would, for instance, create an estimated 8.8 million jobs while reducing deficits by more than $4 trillion over 10 years. From state infrastructure banks to training programs for the long-term unemployed, there are plenty of ways to reduce unemployment without betraying conservative principles.

We are so pleased that President Obama selected a pro-employment champion -- Janet Yellen -- to lead the Federal Reserve. While we know we can count on her to continue strong monetary policies to promote job creation, we ultimately hope we can eliminate the need for her help. In 2014, we’ll redouble our efforts to get Congress to come to its senses and pass a serious jobs agenda.

###3542||As Sears hurtles toward bankruptcy, Wall Street is wondering what Lampert will salvage for himself and his US$1.3 billion fund, whose future may now be in doubt###3543||Empty###3544||In her first meeting as Federal Reserve chair next week, Janet Yellen will put her stamp on policy by reaching for a favorite tool of central bankers: words intended to guide markets in the direction policy makers want.

For more than a year, the Fed has kept monetary policy easy with assurances that its main interest rate won’t rise at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is no more than 2.5 percent. That guidance is almost obsolete: Although unemployment is forecast to fall below the threshold this year, most Fed officials don’t foresee a rate increase until 2015.

Yellen’s challenge is to replace the threshold with guidance that’s less specific while also making it clear that rates won’t rise any time soon. If the Fed retreats to language that investors find vague and economic data comes in strong, traders are likely to move forward their estimate of when the central bank will raise rates, creating volatility in financial markets.

“Getting rid of the thresholds requires the committee to do something to keep the market in place,” said Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now senior managing director at forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington. “It is going to be quite volatile out there. What they are trying to do is prevent the markets from pushing up the timing of the rate increases.”

Volatility on interest rates of less than two years could have an impact on borrowing costs across the economy, especially on transactions in which long-term debt is financed with short-term borrowing.

The Fed’s interest rate thresholds have helped lower financing costs for companies whose bonds are rated below investment grade, or less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service or BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.

Yields on speculative-grade bonds have shrunk to within 3.82 percentage points of U.S. government securities on average, down from 5.29 percentage points when the Fed put the thresholds in place on Dec. 12, 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.

Analysts at Barclays PLC studied the market for two-year forward rates on two-year swap yields to measure the impact of expectations for changes in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, or the overnight rate for loans between banks.

The analysis shows that volatility, or the expected size and frequency of interest rate moves, remained low after the Fed put the thresholds in place but began to rise as unemployment fell closer to the Fed’s 6.5 percent goal.

“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp” the Fed’s post-meeting statement “to take out that 6.5 percent threshold,” New York Fed President William Dudley, who also serves as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, said March 6 at an event in New York.

Yellen and the FOMC can also reach for other tools to guide markets on the outlook for the short-term rate.

The Fed could point to its bond-purchase program, which it is trimming at a pace of $10 billion per meeting. With the current pace of purchases at $65 billion a month and seven meetings left in 2014, the Fed won’t stop buying bonds until the fourth quarter.

Any increase in the short-term rate can be ruled out as long as bond purchases continue because the Fed wouldn’t tighten policy with one tool while easing with another, said Michael Hanson, a former Fed economist who is now senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York.

“It’s going to be very difficult for them to think about raising rates before concluding the taper,” Hanson said, “so hiking this year is extremely unlikely.”

A big drop in China exports has the commodity complex fearing demand destruction drops more than geo-political risk. Forget about Ukraine, Libya, a strong US Jobs report or the possibility of a terrorist blowing up a Jet from Malaysia, it is about China in the early trade. Chinese exports plunged tanked by a shocking 18.1% leading to a 23 billion dollar trade deficit. The markets are trying to adjust to a shaky new Lunar New Year. Oh sure some blame the holiday but after getting one China company default it is possible that China is headed towards a very hard landing.

The reason why this is so shocking is just one month ago China trade expanded by 10.6%. We saw copper imports were soaring. Still China Copper Imports were up January through February was up 41.2% but in February fell 29%. It looks like copper buyers loaded up on supply fearing what traders

China’s consumer prices rose 2% in February at their slowest rate in 13 months. So it does give some room to stimulate if need be but one of the reason prices fell was pork prices fell by 9%. Pork prices are again on the rise as the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus is devastated the US pig crop. Producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month by dropping 2 percent, slightly above forecasts for a 1.9 percent drop leading to more concerns that China is having a hard time keeping things together.

Add to that Japan revised down its growth estimate for the final three months of last year after announcing a record current account deficit for January. Japan’s Cabinet Office said both private and public demand was lower than its earlier estimate.

Reuters is reporting that armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorized sale of oil from a rebel-held port. A North Korean-flagged tanker, the Morning Glory, docked on Saturday at the port of Es Sider and local daily al-Wasat said it had loaded $36 million of crude oil. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the military will bomb the 37,000-tonne vessel if it tries to leave.

Officials said on Sunday that the navy and pro-government militias had dispatched boats to stop it from getting out. The rebels said any attack on the tanker would be “a declaration of war.” The escalating conflict over the country’s oil wealth is a sign of mounting chaos in Libya, where the government has failed to rein in fighters who helped oust veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and who now defy state authority.

The protesters, who also include former soldiers and ex-oil guards led by a former anti-Gaddafi commander, Ibrahim Jathran, have seized three eastern ports in the OPEC member country. The Defense Ministry issued orders to the chief of staff, air force and navy to deal with the tanker. “The order authorizes the use of force and puts the responsibility for any resulting damage on the ship owner,” it said in a statement. “Several navy boats have been dispatched. Now the tanker’s movements are under complete control and nobody can move it,” said Culture Minister Habib al-Amin, who acts as informal government spokesman. “The tanker will stay where it is. “All efforts are being undertaken to stop and seize the tanker, if necessary by a (military) strike, if it does not follow orders,” he said, adding that state prosecutors would treat the loading of the crude as smuggling. There was no sign of any immediate military action, but Libyan news websites showed some small boats close to a tanker which they said was the Morning Glory. Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled him.

Well at least the break in the price of oil may break gas prices that have been on the rise. Trilby Lundberg reported that the average U.S. price per gallon for regular gasoline is now almost $3.51, the highest since last September. Diesel fuel prices also rose, increasing by 2.58 cents from two weeks earlier to an average $4.0323 per gallon. The blame goes to higher “ethanol” prices, stemming in part from the unrest in Ukraine. Corn is a major export for the Ukraine and a rally in Corn and a drought in Brazil have grains hopping. Corn is pulling back a bit. According to the survey, the lowest average price for a gallon of unleaded gas in the U.S. is $3.18 in Jackson, Mississippi. Road Trip!

According to a cost report from eHealthInsurance, a nationwide online private insurance exchange, families are paying an average of $663 a month and singles $274 a month, far more than before Obamacare kicked in. What's more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called "bronze" plans.

The firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system. In California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845.

The shocking surge in prices show what Americans not in Obamacare or covered by their employer are paying as they seek lower premiums. Typically, they are not eligible for the subsidies Obamacare offers those with low incomes.

"Premiums are increasing primarily because of the new required provisions for 2014 Affordable Care Act compliant plans, including guaranteed issue, essential health benefits, modified community rating and minimum actuarial values," said Brian Mast, spokesman for eHealthInsurance. "It is also likely that health insurance companies expected additional risk in the risk pool, because people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be denied coverage, and may have priced their plans higher to accommodate for this risk," said Mast.

His firm's price index also gives an average age for singles buying plans, and the results are worrying for insurers and the Obama administration. That's because the average age is 36, older than the administration had hoped for.

Explaining the higher costs, Mast said, "There are likely other factors, but what is important is that moving forward, there needs to be a collective effort to enroll as many people as possible and create a broad and diverse risk pool to keep premiums in check. eHealth can help in that effort by enrolling consumers off-exchange and is pushing to be able to enroll people in subsidy-eligible plans as well."

There is a hint of good news, though, in firm's the price index. While the current costs for insurance are higher than before Obamacare, they have come down over the past several months.

Below is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:

— Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.

— The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.

— For both individual and family applicants, bronze plans have been the most popular plan type chosen since the beginning of open enrollment.###3550||It says its medical enrollment could grow 3 percent or 4 percent this year.###3551||Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Carney: Forex rigging will be "prosecuted to the full extent of the law"

The Bank of England will tighten its governance after criticism of its response to claims of manipulation of foreign exchange (forex) rates.

Governor Mark Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee that it would create a new deputy governor position with responsibility for markets and banking.

He said the person would carry out "a root and branch review" of how the Bank conducts market intelligence.

It comes amid claims that some bank officials knew of alleged forex fixing.

It has been claimed that currency traders colluded via online chatrooms and instant messaging to manipulate forex rates.

During more than four hours of questioning on a variety to topics, Mr Carney said: "This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets."

But he said the bank had no warning of the alleged manipulation before October.

The Bank currently has three deputy governors, with responsibility for monetary policy, financial stability and prudential regulation.

This is the first real test for the Bank of England's new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging Andrew Tyrie, Chairman, Treasury Committee

The Treasury Committee hearing was aimed at finding out what Bank officials knew of the foreign exchange rate fixing claims.

Mr Carney said he first became aware of the allegations on 16 October.

And he said that within 48 hours of hearing the allegations, the Bank had called in law firm Travers Smith to conduct an independent investigation.

Awareness of claims

Mr Carney's appearance before the committee comes a week after the release of minutes of meetings from 2006 suggesting that some officials were aware of market manipulation then.

The minutes show that a senior member of the Bank of England's staff was told of "attempts to move the market" at a meeting with senior foreign exchange dealers from some of the world's largest banks.

However, Paul Fisher, the Bank's executive director of markets who was head of its foreign exchange division until 2009, told MPs the minutes referred to traders' complaints over difficult markets, not rigging.

"This is about traders whingeing about how difficult their life is and no one is going to have much sympathy for that," he said.

Mr Carney also said he had no information that anyone from the Bank condoned, facilitated or took part in market manipulation.

"We can't come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England," he added.

Any day now its so-called oversight committee will confirm that the allegations of the Bank ignoring signs of market corruption will be independently investigated and evaluated by a senior external lawyer

One Bank of England member of staff has been suspended over compliance concerns.

Mr Carney told the committee the decision to suspend the person was taken by governors, and that "we hold staff to very high standards".

'As bad as Libor'

The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, said he remained to be convinced that the Bank was on top of the forex issue.

"This is the first real test for the Bank of England's new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging," he said.

He added: "It has taken some time for the Bank's Oversight Committee to take the lead on accusations of misconduct relating to forex.

"The public needs confidence that the Bank's governance structures will ensure that it gets to the bottom of forex-related misconduct allegations. The public also needs confidence that any misconduct in other areas will be discovered."

Regulators have expressed concern that alleged forex manipulation could become the latest banking scandal.

The head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Martin Wheatley, said last month that currency manipulation was "every bit as bad" as the Libor scandal, where banks including Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS paid fines totalling $6bn relating to fixing inter-bank lending rates.###3552||Empty###3553||Empty###3554||Texas, the land of missed opportunity.

Last year, elected leaders rejected the chance to expand Medicaid, forgoing billions in federal dollars. Now Texas residents have been slow to enroll in health insurance, leaving more money on the table and more uninsured in the state.

In Texas, 295,000 had enrolled by March 1. That’s just 9.4 percent of 3.14 million eligible for coverage.

The sign-up rate is lower than the U.S. average and the worst among the largest states.

California had three times more enrollees than Texas. Ten states, including New York, Michigan and North Carolina, had twice the share of the eligible population turn out.

The online marketplace is a key part of the Affordable Care Act, enabling people to sign up for private insurance and receive federal subsidies to help cover the cost.

Two weeks remain in open enrollment for 2014, and advocacy groups in North Texas are putting on a big push. They’re sponsoring health fairs and other events, hoping to spark a last-minute surge in the state with the highest rate of uninsured.

Don’t expect encouragement from political leaders in Austin. Gov. Rick Perry never stopped campaigning against Obamacare, and conservative candidates have continued to hammer the issue in recent primaries.

The state didn’t invest in outreach and education, and received a tiny fraction of the federal funds that went to states that embraced the law.

Clearly, want-to matters and the effects are evident. But the feds also messed up the website, which hardly worked for the first two months. That killed early momentum.

Although those technical problems have been resolved, results have suffered nationwide. About 6 million Americans are expected to sign up through the exchanges, about 1 million fewer than projected initially.

Texas still stands apart. Florida has Republicans at the top of state government, and it’s managed to do much better. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17.4 percent of those eligible in Florida had signed up by March 1.

For Texas to have matched that rate, it would have had to enroll almost 252,000 additional people from October through February. That would have required a concerted effort.

“Why would you expect to fill up enrollment?” said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a Washington consulting firm. “Because a law says so? There are a lot of laws no one pays attention to.”

California seized the opportunity. Politicians backed health reform from the beginning, including the expansion of Medicaid. The state created its own well-functioning website. And there was a massive grass-roots effort to sign up residents.

By Avalere’s estimates, California is already ahead of projections for year one. So is Florida, and Michigan is close.

Although Florida has a Republican governor, he wanted the state to expand Medicaid. Many Democratic lawmakers also supported the health care effort.

Michigan has a Republican governor who embraced Medicaid expansion and helped win approval from legislators. The state also has a history of strong grass-roots organizations.

Some have compared the current health care rollout to the expansion of Medicare Part D and children’s health insurance. But Obamacare is a heavier lift.

Politicians eventually got behind Medicare Part D and CHIP so resistance faded. Medicare expansion was offered to people who often had experience shopping for health insurance. And the children’s health plan required little, if any, financial contribution from families.

Five years after CHIP was introduced in 1998, only 60 percent of eligible children were participating, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Mendelson believes that 75 percent of those eligible will eventually get insurance through the exchanges, perhaps in five years. He expects hospitals and doctors to put more money into enrollment efforts because they can’t count on the politics to change.

“We’ve had some success with sign-up events, but we clearly have a long way to go,” said Steve Love, president of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council.

Texas is a rich target, because 1 in 4 residents has no insurance, the highest rate in the country. That’s a lot of low-hanging fruit. In contrast, 96 percent of residents in Massachusetts have coverage, according to Kaiser.

Most experts predicted the sign-ups would start slowly and build over time because insurance is so complicated. It’s also expensive, depending on subsidies and income level.

After the subsidy, costs range from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income.

Affordability is crucial to the program. So far, more than 8 in 10 enrollees nationwide selected plans that had a subsidy, regulators said.

If that trend holds, almost 2 million Texans could get both insurance and help paying for it. The sooner they embrace it, the better.###3555||After two years, Central China Securities has scrapped its plans for an initial public offering in Shanghai as the mainland brokerage believes it will be easier and quicker to raise up to US$400 million in Hong Kong.

The mid-sized firm, based in Henan province, appeared on the global radar in 2008 when it announced with Wall Street bank Citigroup a plan to set up an investment banking joint venture.

The plan was later scrapped as Citigroup decided to team up with other local partners.

Central China Securities had hired CCB International, the Hong Kong-based investment banking arm of China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four state-run banks headquartered in Beijing, to be the lead sponsor for its upcoming offer in Hong Kong, people familiar with the situation said.

The firm had not yet formally applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for the listing, but it aimed to launch it within two months, the sources said.

"It will definitely be in the first half of this year," one of them said. "The market environment changes quickly, and the key is to get listed as soon as you can."

Central China Securities' plans for a Hong Kong float came as a surprise to some industry executives, but others said it reflected the new thinking at the mainland's securities regulator.

During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the industry watchdog might abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the regulator.

This would make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the future.

Yao's remark is good news for capital-hungry mainland firms facing a nationwide downturn in economic growth, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a large backlog from the recently lifted 15-month suspension of listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.

"Timing means everything in the financial business," said another source. "Central China Securities has sort of wasted two years in preparing its plan for a Shanghai IPO, and as it has been proven to be much easier to list in Hong Kong, then why not?"

The trick to getting a company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days: first, secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half the shares in the flotation.

That is why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's listing market looks more like a series of private placements these days.

Mainland brokerages are no strangers to the Hong Kong stock market. Top-tier players such as Citic Securities and Haitong Securities have listed in the city in the past few years. So have mainland banks, including all the Big Four.###3556||The Note's Must-Reads are a round-up of today's political headlines and stories from ABC News and the top U.S. newspapers.

HEALTHCARE The Los Angeles Times' Noam Levey: " Obamacare Enrollment Tops 5 Million Amid Surge In Sign-Ups" More than 5 million people have now signed up for health insurance on marketplaces created by President Obama's healthcare law, thanks to a surge in enrollment over the last two weeks, the Obama administration announced Monday. The quickening pace of sign-ups confirms that many Americans are using the new marketplaces as a March 31 deadline approaches for getting coverage this year. The latest figures indicate that roughly 1 million people enrolled during the last two weeks, surpassing the total for all of February. LINK

The Hill's Jonathan Easley: " ObamaCare Enrollment Hit 5 Million" ObamaCare enrollment spiked in March, and a total of 5 million people have signed up since the insurance marketplaces launched in October, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner wrote in a blog post Monday. Less than a week ago, the administration said 4.2 million had signed up for coverage through the end of February, meaning that about 800,000 people have enrolled so far in March. That's good news for the Obama administration; the number of enrollments had fallen from 1.1 million in January to 942,000 in February. LINK

The Washington Times' Stephen Dinan: " Too Little, Too Late? Obamacare Sign-Ups Rise As Deadline Looms" Five million people have now signed up for health plans through Obamacare's exchanges, the administration announced Monday, arguing they are seeing a last-minute surge of interest ahead of the March 31 deadline. Officials said more than 1 million people visited the federal HealthCare.gov website this weekend, and 4 million visited last week, producing hundreds of thousands of new enrollees. "As this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act," said Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. LINK

USA Today's Kelly Kennedy: " More Than 5 Million Now Enrolled In Health Exchanges" More than 5 million people have signed up for health insurance through the federal and state exchanges, Department of Health and Human Services officials said Monday. That's 1 million shy of the 6 million people the government expects to have enrolled by March 31, the deadline for open enrollment for both insurance through the exchanges and through private insurers. They have 14 days to hit that goal. LINK

The Washington Post's Sandhya Somashekhar: " Obamacare Enrollment Hits 5 Million" The Obama administration announced Monday that more than 5 million people have signed up for new insurance plans under the health-care law, suggesting new momentum for the program as the deadline to get covered this year approaches. About 800,000 people selected health plans on the state and federal insurance marketplaces in the beginning of March, officials said in a blog post - almost as many as signed up during the entire month of February. The figure brings the administration closer to Congressional Budget Office projections that 6 million people would enroll by the end of March. LINK

The Wall Street Journal's Jennifer Corbett Dooren: " New Health Exchanges Reach 5 Million Enrollees" The Obama administration said Monday that five million people had signed up for private health insurance on exchanges as of the past weekend, signaling an uptick in enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. The roughly 800,000 people who enrolled between March 1 and March 16 compares with a total of 943,000 people who picked plans in February. The newest batch of enrollees come as the Obama administration has stepped up its effort to lure young consumers in advance of a March 31 deadline to get coverage this year. LINK

The Boston Globe's Liz Kowalczyk: " State Dismisses Health Site Firm" Massachusetts is dropping the contractor that created the state's dysfunctional online health insurance marketplace, ending a troubled partnership that has left thousands of consumers frustrated and many without coverage for months. The state notified CGI last week that it was being terminated, and officials have started negotiating a transition. The $68-million contract with the Montreal-based technology consulting company expires in September, and Sarah Iselin, who was hired last month by Governor Deval Patrick to oversee repairs to the Health Connector website, said that exactly when CGI finishes its work and how much the state pays for it are subject to bargaining.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS ABC News' Mary Bruce: " Obama Urges Palestinian Leader To Accept Framework For Peace Talks" With a key deadline looming, President Obama today urged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to accept guidelines for new Mideast peace talks. "Now is the time for not just the leaders of both sides but also the peoples of both sides to embrace this opportunity for peace," the president told reporters ahead of his Oval Office meeting with Abbas. Obama admitted that an agreement is an "elusive goal," saying "it's very hard. It's very challenging."We remain convinced that there is an opportunity," he said. "We're going to have to take some tough political decisions and risks if we're able to move it forward. And my hope is that we can continue to see progress in the coming days and weeks." LINK

The New York Times' Alissa Rubin: " Deterioration In U.S.-Russian Relations May Disrupt Coming Talks With Iran" Tensions between the West and Russia over events in Ukraine have cast a shadow over the second round of talks set to begin on Tuesday in Vienna on a permanent nuclear agreement with Iran. Although the talks have no direct connection to Ukraine, their success hinges on solidarity among the so-called P5-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which include Russia, plus Germany - in favor of a tough agreement with Iran to drastically scale back its nuclear program.

FLOTUS ABC News' Ann Compton: " Michelle Obama Headed To China" White House advisers on Monday described First Lady Michelle Obama's upcoming official trip to China as focused on cultural exchanges and the value of education, not on human rights and divisive issues they say are discussed when her husband speaks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. "The nature of her visit is really quite different," said Ben Rhodes, deputy National Security advisor for Strategic Communications, on a conference call with reporters. "What the First Lady really brings is the power of her own story, the power of American values." The first lady will tell of her own modest upbringing when she visits schools in Beijing and Chengdu, with a side trip to see the legendary terracotta warriors in the interior city of Xi'an. Teen daughter Malia Obama and her younger sister Sasha will be along during their spring break, as well as their grandmother Marian Robinson. LINK

USA Today's David Jackson: " M. Obama Visits China For 'People-to-People' Diplomacy" First lady Michelle Obama heads to China this week, and hopes to avoid any talk about American-Chinese political differences. "The overall message of this trip will be on people-to-people exchange," said Tina Tchen, the first lady's chief of staff, with an emphasis on "cultural exchanges" and education. Mrs. Obama will meet with her Chinese counterpart Peng Liyuan, the wife of President Xi Jinping, but the two first ladies will visit a school. The U.S. first lady will also address American and Chinese students at Peking University, and visit a high school in Chengdu. LINK

UKRAINE Wall Street Journal's Carol E. Lee, Jay Solomon and Gregory L. White: " Russia Moves Closer To Absorbing Crimea, Despite Sanctions" Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off an initial round of Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and defied warnings of stiffer punishment to come by taking another step toward annexing Crimea. The Obama administration Monday enacted what it called the most comprehensive sanctions to hit Russia since the end of the Cold War. It targeted 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials, including some of Mr. Putin's top advisers and the ousted former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, a close Kremlin ally. LINK

REP CHARLES RANGEL AND MAYOR DE BLASIO Politico's John Bresnahan and Maggie Haberman: " Charles Rangel And Bill de Blasio: Political Silence" As he takes on the final campaign of his career, veteran New York Rep. Charles Rangel should be untouchable. After all, the new mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, ran Rangel's reelection campaign in 1994. And given that Rangel is a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, it might make sense that he'd be close to the country's first African-American president. But these days, Rangel can't even get de Blasio on the phone - let alone meet with him. And the mayor so far has remained publicly neutral in the 22-term incumbent's reelection race. LINK

The union, and the thorough clean-up of banks’ books that will accompany it, is meant to restore banks’ confidence in one another and boost lending to other businesses and households.

New lending has been throttled by banks’ efforts to raise capital and reduce the bad loans that proliferated in the recession triggered by the global financial crisis and deepened by the eurozone’s own sovereign debt crisis.

Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the single supervisor for all eurozone banks from November.

But talks on a single European agency to wind up or close failing banks, and on a single fund to back it up, have entered a crucial stage: EU governments, represented by finance ministers of the 28-nation bloc, and the European Parliament must reach a deal next week.

If they don’t, there won’t be enough time to complete the legislative process for the resolution mechanism before the last sitting of the current parliament in mid-April. The key law would be delayed by at least seven months, probably more.

“The ground is very well prepared, now we have to show political will. We will stay there (in the meeting) as long as it takes to find a solution,” one EU official involved in the preparations for the talks said.

“It’s clear to all EU member states that if we want to achieve an agreement there’s only one direction to go — to try to accommodate the parliament,” the official said.

The problem is that European governments and the European Parliament want different things.

EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the eurozone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that decision must be signed into law by the EU’s executive Commission and by all the finance ministers.

The European Parliament wants no involvement of EU finance ministers, arguing it would politicise the process.

Parliament also wants the ECB — the supervisor of all banks — to be the only institution that can declare a bank is failing and that its fate has to be resolved. EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.

Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.

The fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around €55bn.###3558||Empty###3559||Insurers from Hong Kong and other overseas markets are lobbying mainland authorities for permission to sell products in Guangdong province after finding it hard to compete with domestic players, according to industry players.

Chan Kin-por, legislator for the insurance sector, told the South China Morning Post that he and some officials from the Office of Commissioner of Insurance recently urged mainland authorities in Qianhai and Guangdong to allow Hong Kong-based insurers to use their Hong Kong agents to sell products to residents there. They also pressed for more flexible product approvals.

"Over more than 20 years of development, foreign insurers still find it hard to compete in the mainland insurance market where combined they have less than 4 per cent of the market," Chan said, adding that part of the reason was that domestic rivals had more sales agents.

He said foreign insurers found it hard to bring their best-selling products to mainland customers.

"Unlike Hong Kong where insurers can freely introduce any new insurance products, in China all insurance companies must first get regulatory approval before any new product launch. The regulator does not approve overseas insurers bringing in innovative insurance products to the mainland and that prevents them competing with new products," Chan said.

Manuel Bauer, a board member of German insurer Allianz, one of the first batch of foreign insurers in 1999, said it would be tough to compete with mainland insurers.

"The domestic mainland insurance companies are so dominant that it is a mission impossible for the foreign insurance [company]," Bauer told the South China Morning Post during a visit to Hong Kong last week.

Total gross premiums for foreign insurance companies last year stood at 67.99 billion yuan (HK$86.04 billion), representing only 3.9 per cent of the market, with the rest taken by domestic insurers, according to data from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.

Bauer said Allianz would continue to expand on the mainland where it sells a wide range of policies including life, pension, motor insurance and asset management products. The firm's total gross premiums in China rose 30 per cent last year.

Despite the low market share, foreign insurers experienced strong growth in mainland sales and future prospects were bright, he said. All foreign life insurance firms in China posted 25.56 per cent growth in premium income last year while all foreign general insurers saw a 23.63 per cent gain in premiums, government statistics showed.

"China has a huge population. The country is still in its early stage of development in the insurance market," said Bauer. "Its insurance penetration rate is lower than in other international markets. This provides a lot of room for growth."

Swiss Re said premiums in mainland China in 2012 represented only 2.96 per cent of its gross domestic product, against 8.18 per cent in the United States, 11.27 per cent in Britain, 12.44 per cent in Hong Kong and 18.19 per cent in Taiwan.###3560||Expedited process available for some disabled veterans

Q: I am a disabled veteran. I have a compensation rating of 100% Permanent and Total from the Veteran's Administration. Will I automatically qualify to receive Social Security disability?

A: No. You would have to apply for Social Security disability and go through the application process.

You may have heard that Social Security recently announced rules regarding an expedited process for processing disability applications filed by veterans with a Department of Veterans Affairs disability compensation rating of 100% Permanent & Total, or P&T. Carolyn W. Colvin, acting commissioner of Social Security, recently unveiled a new initiative to expedite disability claims.

Under the new process, Social Security will treat these veterans' applications as high priority and issue expedited decisions, similar to the way the agency handles disability claims from wounded warriors.

“Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and it is only right that we ensure they have timely access to the disability benefits they may be eligible for and deserve,” Colvin said. “Social Security worked with Veterans Affairs to identify those veterans with disabilities who have a high probability of also meeting our definition of disability. I am proud of our collaboration and happy to announce this new service for America's vets.”

To receive the expedited service, veterans must tell Social Security they have a VA disability compensation rating of 100% P&T and show proof of their disability rating with their VA notification letter.

The VA rating only expedites Social Security disability claims processing and does not guarantee an approval for Social Security disability benefits. These veterans still must meet the strict eligibility requirements for a disability allowance.

Social Security plans to launch the expedited process in mid-March. For information about this service, please visit www.socialsecurity.gov/pgm/disability-pt.htm. For more about Social Security's handling of wounded warriors' disability claims, visit www. socialsecurity.gov/wounded warriors.

Q: My full retirement age is 66 years and 4 months because I was born in 1956. What is the earliest age I can begin receiving retirement benefits? Is it 62, or 62 and 4 months?

A: The earliest age you can begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits is 62. Although the full retirement age is increasing from age 66 to 67 for people born after 1954, you still can apply as early as age 62 regardless of what your full retirement age may be.

If you decide to receive benefits before your full retirement age, you will receive a reduced benefit. Keep in mind you will not be able to receive Medicare coverage until age 65, even if you decide to retire at an earlier age. You can learn more about the full retirement age on our website at www.social security.gov/pubs/ageincrease. htm.

This default has caused quite a stir among analysts, many of whom view this as an opportunity for China’s corporate bond market to enhance its risk pricing mechanism.

This highlights some issues with China’s corporate bond market. First, the excessively optimistic bond rating assigned to corporations like Chaori, which had experienced financial distress for months preceding the default, needs to be checked with more realistic ratings. Second, while the Chaori default may promote better risk pricing, it may also cause a bifurcation of bond rating and pricing between state-owned companies and their subsidiaries, which have the implicit backing of the government, and non-state ownership types. This would reinforce the financing bias against non-state firms, and not truly reflect creditworthiness. Third, while the corporate bond market in China for bonds with AA- ratings or above is relatively liquid, the market for bonds with ratings below this mark is relatively illiquid, further reinforcing the bond market bifurcation. Fourth, as the corporate bond market is expected to expand to include more local government financing vehicle bonds, there is a question of how these bonds will be viewed by the market; i.e., will they be viewed as government backed or not, and will the bond rating take precedence over the fact that they represent local government debt?

In other words, China continues to lag behind in risk rating and pricing of the corporate bond market and until these issues are addressed, it will continue to do so. Although some analysts believed bonds were making strides in pricing risk before the Chaori failure, the fact that many bonds are rated as AA- or above even though the interest coverage ratio (using EBITDA) is negative or less than one, revealing a weakness in ability to pay the bond coupon, shows that China’s corporate bond market is less resilient than it appears.

What does this mean for the rest of the financial economy? While some have predicted that the Chaori event will result in a revelation of risk exposure and correction across the board, it seems unlikely that this will be the case, in part due to the issues presented above. Other financial sectors of the economy have responded to risks in different ways, some with local government bailouts, as in the case of trusts, some with central government bailouts, as in the case of banks, and some with failures, as in the case of private finance. This can be attributed to the high degree of segmentation in China’s financial economy, in which the activities of financial instruments may not move in tandem, and to a lack of financial marketization, in which financial activity is not governed by interest rates or other strong market forces.

Without some fundamental, institutional changes in China’s financial economy, “market forces” will continue to be prevented from taking shape. While the Chaori incident may improve risk signaling in the non-state owned portion of the corporate bond market, it will by no means be a catalyst for positive change in the rest of the financial economy. Major reform must take place before Chinese finance relies on the natural forces of exchange rather than artificial forces posed by state owned institutions, regulated interest rates, and automatic bailout mechanisms.

Although the UK’s trade deficit fell 11 per cent to £29.9 billion last year, Charlie Bean said the shortfall in exports needs to narrow further to put growth on a more solid footing.

In a speech to business leaders in the north-east of England, Bean said: “Any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10 per cent in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports.”

The foreign exchange market will be in the spotlight again today when MPs are expected to grill the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, and seize on a trading scandal to press their demands for tighter oversight. Last week the Bank suspended an employee amid a probe into what officials knew about alleged ­rigging of currency rates in the $5.3 trillion (£3.2tn)-a-day forex market.

Mark Garnier, a member of the House of Commons Treasury committee, said any perceptions that the Bank was not tough enough on tackling problems could damage London’s reputation as a financial centre, potentially weakening the UK’s hand in European Union talks over reforms.

Last month Ian McCafferty, who sits alongside Bean on the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), said he would “get more worried” if sterling continued to rise, and this could delay any moves to raise the base rate, which has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent for five years.

Financial markets and others on the MPC have signalled that borrowing costs could start rising in the spring of next year, but Bean cautioned against “getting too hung up” about dates.

He said: “What, I think, is more useful for businesses is our expectation that, when bank rate does rise, it will probably do so only gradually and to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of 5 per cent for some while – I have something like a 2 to 3 per cent range in mind here.”

Bean also said it was possible that the Bank might not sell back all of the £375bn of government bonds it bought under its quantitative easing scheme, because they may be needed as collateral against lenders’ reserves.###3563||Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage lender in the United States, updated its mortgage rates on Wednesday.For March 12, the best rate for the standard 30-year fixed rate mortgage is 4.625% with an APR of 4.719%.

Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury Committee that earlier on Tuesday heard evidence from BoE Governor Mark Carney and other senior officials, said the Bank had “taken some time” to take the lead on accusations of misconduct in forex markets.

“This is the first real test for the Bank of England's new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging,” he said in a statement.

Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the Bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.###3567||Shares

, LONDON, March 12- King Digital Entertainment, the British developer behind the wildly addictive mobile game Candy Crush, said on Wednesday that it could be valued at up to $7.6 billion in its eagerly awaited upcoming flotation.

The planned listing on the New York Stock Exchange, unveiled last month, is the latest in a series by Internet and gaming firms over the past three years the most high-profile being Facebook and Twitter.

King said on Wednesday that it was planning an initial public offering of 22.2 million shares each priced at between $21 and $24 a share.

That could give the company a market capitalization of between $6.6 billion and $7.6 billion (4.75 billion 5.5 billion euros).

“We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of $326 million,” King said in a statement.

“We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions.”

King outlined its pricing in a statement issued by the US regulatory body SEC for the New York listing.

Candy Crush King’s top seller started life as a Facebook game in 2012 but can also be played online and on smartphones.

Millions of commuters, teenagers even pensioners worldwide clock in daily to test their skills at the game, which basically involves moving brightly coloured sweets around a grid to get at least three of a kind in a row.

But Nader's latest proposal on Fannie and Freddie isn't likely to endear him to those investors, which have amassed large positions in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities since 2008, when the GSEs were placed into conservatorship and the price of their securities fell nearly to zero. In a recent interview with TheStreet, Nader made the following suggestion:

If [U.S. government officials] were real equitable, they would say 'Okay, for the day traders we're not giving dividends but we're going to declare a special dividend since the tax payers have been paid back before the end of the year. We're going to declare a special dividend for shareholders who held shares before the collapse and still hold them." So for the old shareholders, they get a dividend, and the new ones, you know, they knew what they were getting into. They weren't deceived. It had already collapsed.

Nader, who owned shares of Fannie and Freddie before they were put into conservatorship in 2008 and has hung onto those investments, has a long track record of fighting for the middle class. As a result, in pushing the government to restore the rights of shareholders, Nader has far more credibility than the large investors with whom he has allied himself. Still, Nader says he has no qualms about helping the big investors make a killing:

We wanted tougher regulation prohibiting them from the kind of lobbying they're doing, this is all before 2008, making them meet the demands for affordable housing, the needs of affordable housing which they were ignoring because they were going for the easiest profits. And so, you know, it's like saying that someone who's been around for years, 'These newcomers, aren't they tainting you?' No. I mean, you know, we're really well grounded in this. And they're raising interesting issues on the decision to grab all the profits. And if they're doing it and they've got lawyers to do it, well, that sort of helps us because we also agree that, that was an unlawful interpretation, changing the rules of the game unilaterally like that.

Follow @dan_freed###3570||On Monday, the New York Times detailed William A. Ackman’s “extraordinary attempt to leverage the corridors of power” in order to to drive down Herbalife stock prices. Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, has gone short on Herbalife.

He stands to make a great deal of money if the stock price declines — and he is not about to leave its decline to chance. So, the Times reports, Ackman has enlisted congressional representatives to solicit an investigation. He has organized news conferences and letter-writing campaigns. He is trying to make his attack on Herbalife’s stock seem a grassroots, civil rights issue.

The only thing extraordinary about all of this, however, is that the New York Times finds it extraordinary. These are some of the hoariest practices in American capitalism. Indeed, in 1886, Isaac Bromley, who was both a journalist and a lobbyist, accused the Times of being a tool of Wall Street bears in driving down Union Pacific stock. Bulls were using two other papers, the Indicator and the Graphic, to boost the stock.

Charles Francis Adams Jr., the president of Union Pacific, found himself in despair as Congress debated bills in 1886 to investigate his railroad. The railroad had a history of corruption — but that was not the point of the investigation.

Senators had unintentionally, Adams wrote, “been like jumping-jacks under the hidden manipulation of Wall Street influences. Men in Wall Street have pulled the strings and these senators have jumped up on their legs and waved their arms exactly like manikins.”

As far as the bears were concerned, the investigation helped their short sales. They were only interested in driving down the stock price.

Using Congress to influence the price of securities was a well-honed practice long before 1886. It was a familiar part of Jay Gould’s tool kit. In 1874, Gould’s lobbyists recruited congressmen to introduce legislation that would influence the price of Pacific Steamship stock, a particular favorite of such efforts. They were to share in the proceeds, but Gould betrayed them.

Sometimes, as with Gould, congressmen were corrupt. Sometimes, as in Adams’ example, they were dupes. The results were the same.

But the lessons in all this go well beyond the manipulations of Wall Street. It is a window into how the market and politics constitute each other and have constituted each other for a very long time. Congress is just another arena in which corporations compete.

It is too easy to think that corporations and financiers become involved in politics only to obtain favors from government or to subvert regulation. They use politics to battle each other.

In 1875 Grenville Dodge, in his incarnation as a lobbyist for the Texas and Pacific Railroad in its battle with the Southern Pacific Railroad, pretty much outlined the playbook for using politics to decide corporate struggles. He solicited newspaper stories and provided the “facts” to journalists. He instigated letter-writing campaigns so that his employers’ positions seemed to be those of a congressman’s constituents. He paid to have petitions circulated in key congressional districts.

His operative was ordered not to rest “until he had the name of nearly every voter there on a petition by some pretense or other.” He recruited actual reformers, the Grangers, to denounce the Texas and Pacific’s rival, the Southern Pacific, as a monopoly. It was a monopoly — but that was not Dodge’s concern.

I do not know whether Ackman’s views about Herbalife are correct — but I do have more than a suspicion that the battle to drive down its stock prices is business as usual. The New York Times article that details the story inevitably becomes part of the story.

Financial markets aren’t about reality. They are about information. And for those betting on the rise and fall of stock, it is the short term that matters.

To see all this as an aberration is to misjudge how finance works. And how it has worked for a very long time.

Authorities now believe someone on board the Boeing 777 shut down part of the aircraft’s messaging system at about the same time the plane disappeared from civilian radar. But an Inmarsat satellite was able to automatically connect with a portion of the messaging system that remained in operation, similar to a phone call that keeps ringing because no one picks it up. No location data were exchanged, but the satellite continued to identify the plane once an hour for four to five hours after it disappeared from radar screens.

Based on the hourly connections with the plane, described by a U.S. official as a “handshake,” the satellite knows at what angle to tilt its antenna to be ready to receive a message from the plane should one be sent. Using that antenna angle plus radar data, investigators have been able to draw two vast arcs from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. The plane is believed to be somewhere along those arcs.

Air crash investigators have never used this kind of satellite data before to try to find a missing plane, but after pursuing other leads, it is the best clue left.###3576||If the Bank of England cracked the glass ceiling in UK financial markets when it recruited Charlotte Hogg as operating chief last summer, it could today lay claim to having shattered it.

The Bank has appointed Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik to the new post of deputy governor for markets and banking. She joins from the International Monetary Fund, where she oversees operations in Europe and the Middle East, has responsibility for its $1 billion administrative budget and handles HR for its 3,000 staff.

...###3577||Vodafone Group Plc.'s (VOD,VOD.L) Vodafone Holdings Europe S.L.U. agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Grupo Corporativo Ono, S.A. for a total consideration equivalent to 7.2 billion euros or 6.0 billion pounds on a debt and cash free basis.

Ono has the largest next-generation network ("NGN") in Spain, with approximately 7.2 million homes released to marketing in 13 of Spain's 17 regions, reaching more than 300 municipalities, including the nine largest cities. Ono offers fixed and mobile communications and television services to approximately 1.9 million customers.

The company said that the transaction enables Vodafone Holdings to take advantage of the rapid increase in the adoption of unified communications products and services in the Spanish market and provides Vodafone with immediate access to 7.2 million homes at a significant time-to-market advantage.

The Transaction is expected to generate significant cost and capex savings with an annual run-rate of about 240 million euros (200 million pounds), before integration costs, in the fourth full year post completion, equivalent to a net present value of 2.0 billion euros (1.7 billion pounds) after integration costs.

Vodafone Holdings also expects to be able to cross-sell its mobile services to Ono's customers and offer new services, using both companies' product sets and networks. Vodafone Holdings estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately 1.0 billion euros (0.8 billion pounds) after integration costs.

The company stated that transaction comfortably meets Vodafone Holdings' M&A criteria and is expected to be accretive to Vodafone Holdings 's adjusted earnings per share, which excluds purchase accounting adjustments relating to the Transaction, and FCF per share after cost and capex and before integration costs from the first full year post completion.

Vodafone Holdings would expect Ono's management to become an integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined . Ono's employees will also benefit from a broader range of international career opportunities available across the Vodafone Group.

Vodafone Holdings will finance the transaction from its existing cash resources and committed but undrawn bank facilities.

The Transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions, including anti-trust clearances by the relevant competent authorities. Vodafone Holdings expects the Transaction to complete in calendar third-quarter 2014.

For the twelve months ended 31 December 2013, Ono reported revenue of 1.598 billion euros(1.324 billion pounds), EBITDA of 680 million euros (563 million pounds) adjusted to remove a 6 million euros PPA non-cash item, operating profit of 269 million euros (223 million pounds).

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of kilometres off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage hardened further after it was confirmed the last radio message from the cockpit - an informal “alright, good night” - was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

But police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite information suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, the other south from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbour to “immediately” expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

“He asked that Australia take responsibility for the search in the southern vector, which the Malaysian authorities now think was one possible flight path for this ill-fated aircraft,” Abbott told Parliament. “I agreed that we would do so.”

Malaysia's transport ministry said in a statement on Monday it had sent diplomatic notes to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force was also searching the southern corridor, it said.

The plane's disappearance has baffled investigators and aviation experts. It disappeared from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

Malaysian authorities believe that, as the plane crossed the north-east coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned sharply to the west.

That has focused attention on the crew. Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

The last words from the cockpit of the missing plane were spoken as it was leaving Malaysian-run airspace and being handed over to air traffic controllers in Vietnam.

The sign-off came after one of the plane's data communication systems, which would have enabled it to be tracked beyond radar coverage, had been switched off, Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Sunday.

“The answer to your question is yes, it was disabled before,” he told reporters when asked if the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane's status - had been shut down before the final sign-off.

It is not known who on board spoke those words, which were first revealed last week.

The informal hand-off went against standard radio procedures, which would have called for the speaker to read back instructions for contacting the next control centre and include the aircraft's call sign, said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways pilot and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

Investigators are likely to examine the recording for any signs of psychological stress and to determine the speaker's identity to confirm whether the flight deck had been taken over by hijackers or the pilot himself was involved, he said.

Police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practice flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilots and any militant group.

“Based on what we have so far, we cannot see the terrorism link here,” he said. “We looked at known terror or extremist groups in Southeast Asia, the links are not there.”

Background checks are also being made on the 227 passengers on the flight, including aviation engineer Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, a 29-year-old Malaysian who worked for a private jet charter company.

“The focus is on anyone else who might have had aviation skills on that plane,” the second police source told Reuters.

As an engineer specialising in executive jets, Khairul would not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner.

Electronic signals the plane continued to exchange periodically with satellites suggest it could have continued flying for about six hours after moving out of range of Malaysian military radar off the north-west coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for a total of about seven-and-a-half to eight hours, Malaysia Airlines' Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said on Sunday.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching from the shores of the former Soviet republics of central Asia to the far south of the Indian Ocean.

Three French civil aviation experts who were involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009 arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to join the growing international search and investigation team.

A source familiar with official US assessments of satellite data being used to try and find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor.

Investigators were also looking at disused airfields in the region with runways capable of handling a large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 777, the paper said.

The New Straits Times also said that the plane dropped to an altitude of 5 000 feet (1 500m) or lower, using a low-flying technique known as “terrain masking” to defeat civilian radar coverage after turning back from its scheduled flight path.

The reports could not be immediately verified. - Reuters###3581||King IPO: King Digital Entertainment PLC said today (Wednesday) it expects a market value of as much as $7.6 billion in its initial public offering.

On Feb. 18, the maker of several hit social Internet games, including tour de force "Candy Crush Saga," filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO). The stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING," with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE: CS), and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: BAC) serving as lead underwriters.

Today, King said its IPO of 22.2 million shares will likely be priced between $21 and $24 per share.

The company itself will sell 15.5 million shares in the offering, while stockholders, such as Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares. According to the IPO filing, entities related to Apax will own 44.2% of the company following the offering. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Riccardo Zacconi will maintain a 9.5% stake.

The King IPO's official pricing is set for later this month, on March 25. All in all, it's projected to raise as much as $532.8 million – a smidge over the $500 million figure King had disclosed in the February filing.

Here are some impressive updated numbers on King's inner workings leading up to a March 26 market debut:

King offers 180 games via Facebook, its own website, and on mobile devices through app downloads.

King's most popular game, "Candy Crush Saga," currently accounts for approximately three-quarters of King's revenue. It's played by 93 million people daily, with more than 1 billion plays every day. The game has been downloaded a whopping 500 million times on mobile devices since its launch in 2012 and is the top game on Facebook (Nasdaq: FB).

Two other King games – "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga" – take up the second and third top spots on Facebook, according to app tracker AppData's January numbers.

King is killing it on mobile. Candy Crush and yet another King game, "Papa Pear Saga," are among the 10 most downloaded apps on Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) devices, according to app tracker AppAnnie's December data. And for more than a year, Candy Crush has been tied with Supercell's "Clash of Clans" and "Hay Day" as the top-grossing iOS and Android game.

King employs 665 people and posted a profit of $567.6 million on revenues of $1.89 billion in 2013, up from $7.8 million in 2012. Around 78% of revenue came from Candy Crush.

Even with such strong usage numbers, there's one reason for investors to steer clear:###3582||Empty###3583||There is new evidence to suggest GM has known about a problem with the ignition switches that are now the subject of a major recall, linked to more than a dozen deaths and the subject of a federal criminal investigation, for 13 years.

The Wall Street Journal reports tonight that according to GM documents given to federal investigators, it had reports of stalling problems with the ignition in question even before the Saturn Ion was launched in late 2002. And that was three years before the Chevy Cobalt, the model most closely linked to this investigation, was put on sale.

That's not a good development when the government is trying to find out if GM told the NHTSA about any problems with these ignition switches in a timely manner.

King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game "Candy Crush Saga", expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

"Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

"I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

ANOTHER ZYNGA?

"Candy Crush" launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".

Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fueled by "Candy Crush" rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.

Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of "Farmville" waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of "Angry Birds".

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in "Candy Crush" gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga". About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (r.reuters.com/bar57v).

"The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."

NYSE DEBUT

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

Colorado U.S. Attorney John Walsh’s office announced Monday it is also seeking the warehouse in Denver where prosecutors say hundreds of pounds of marijuana were grown and processed. Investigators said the business illegally distributed the drug to medical marijuana dispensaries in the Denver area.

The owners of the dispensaries were among 12 people indicted in state court last year on charges including tax evasion, securities fraud and money laundering.

The indictment says they defrauded investors and ran an illegal marijuana growing operation.

Walsh said the civil forfeiture complaint shows prosecutors’ commitment to enforcing federal marijuana laws.

(© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)###3589||Empty###3590||Empty###3591||DENVER — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.###3592||Empty###3593||The USS Roosevelt, attached to the George H.W. Bush Carrier Strike Group, transits the Straits of Gibraltar near the Mediterranean Sea on Feb. 27, 2014.

STUTTGART, Germany — A team of U.S. Navy SEALs seized control early Monday of a commercial tanker that was hijacked in the Mediterranean earlier this month by a small group of armed Libyan men, the Defense Department said.

The SEALs, acting under an order from President Barack Obama, embarked from the USS Roosevelt, which is deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the George H.W. Bush Carrier Strike Group.

“No one was hurt tonight when U.S. forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans,” DOD spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a news release.

A Defense Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two-hour operation resulted in the arrest of three Libyans and the discovery of two AK-47s on board. No shots were fired during the action, he said.

The boarding operation was conducted about 3 a.m. Central European Time in international waters southeast of Cyprus. The SEALs, who are based out of Stuttgart, Germany, are attached to Special Operations Command Europe.

The USS Roosevelt provided helicopter support and served as a command and control and support platform for the other members of the force assigned to conduct the mission, Kirby said.

The Morning Glory is carrying oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra.

The Morning Glory is bound for Libya along with a team of sailors from the USS Stout. The sailors will supervise the transit, Kirby said.

The defense official said it would take about four days for the tanker, which was seized about 15 nautical miles southeast of Cyprus, to return to Libyan waters. About 25 members of the Stout’s crew were on board to provide security, navigation and communications.

Libya has been in a state of political chaos since the NATO-backed overthrow three years ago of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, with armed gangs ruling vast stretches of the desert nation. Oil exports — the pillar of the country’s economy — plummeted after separatist militias in eastern Libya seized key oil-exporting ports and other facilities.

Separatist leaders are now seeking to keep export earnings for themselves by bypassing the impotent central government in Tripoli and selling the eastern region’s oil directly to foreign markets.

Libya’s ineffectual prime minister, Ali Zeidan, was ousted earlier this month when he failed to prevent the Morning Glory from sailing away after it was loaded with the region’s oil. Zaidan, himself accused of corruption, fled to Europe after a parliamentary vote of no confidence.

On March 9, U.S. officials warned that any attempt to sell the stolen oil aboard the Morning Glory would amount to theft from the Libyan National Oil Company and its joint venture partners, which include U.S. companies in the Waha consortium.

“Any oil sales without authorization from these parties places purchasers at risk of exposure to civil liability, penalties and other possible sanctions in multiple jurisdictions,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

The Morning Glory was flagged in North Korea but later de-registered by Pyongyang in connection with the incident, various media have reported.

The USS Roosevelt is homeported in Mayport, Fla., and the USS Stout is homeported in Norfolk, Va.

The Bush Carrier Strike Group and its 6,000 sailors departed Norfolk, Va., last month on what is only the carrier’s second deployment. Four ships and eight aircraft squadrons are accompanying the Bush to the U.S. 6th Fleet and 5th Fleet areas of responsibility as part of the carrier strike group.

The USS George H.W. Bush will remain in the Mediterranean Sea for several days longer than planned as part of a U.S. effort to reassure allies on edge over Russia’s incursion into Ukraine’s Crimean region, the DOD said last week.

The toasted sandwich company said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan.

Quiznos says the move won't affect its customers.

The company only owns and operates seven of the nearly 2,100 Quiznos restaurants. The rest are owned and operated by franchisees and aren't part of the bankruptcy proceedings.

Quiznos also says its distribution centers are open and fulfilling orders.

Quiznos, founded in 1981, says the restructuring plan has been approved by its creditors so it expects to emerge from reorganization quickly.

Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, Inc., a food industry consulting firm, said Quiznos operates in a crowded field where other "fast casual" choices for consumers include Jimmy Johns, Firehouse and Jersey Mike's. All were hurt by the recession, but Quiznos had added pressure from franchisees, several of whom have filed lawsuits accusing the company of putting corporate profits ahead of the concerns of franchise owners.

In a statement about its Chapter 11 filing, Quiznos CEO Stuart Mathis said the company was taking steps to support franchisees that included reducing food costs and making loans available to some franchise owners for restaurant improvements.

Tristano said that while Quiznos might be able to slow its decline, the chances of returning to its heyday, when more than 4,000 Quiznos restaurants were operating, are slim.

"There's too much competition," Tristano said.###3596||Empty###3597||Why did this happen?

I predicted that RadioShack NASDAQOTH:RSHCQ)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJINDICES:^DJI)

My final call was for Ambarella NASDAQ:AMBA)

Two out of three? I can live with that! I have now gone a solid 20 out of 24 over the past eight weeks.

Let me once again whip out my trusty, dusty, and occasionally accurate crystal ball to make three calls that may play out over the next few trading days.

1. Novavax will post a wider loss than expected

Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) is a widely traded maker of vaccines. It moved higher late last month after extending its contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences to develop seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.

Unfortunately, Novavax is losing money, and analysts seem to underestimate the red ink. Wall Street has failed to nail its projections when it comes to Novavax, aiming for a much smaller deficit than what the vaccine maker ultimately reports.

Why get in the way of a long-running streak? My first call is for Novavax to post a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street's projecting this week.

2. The Nasdaq will beat the Dow this week

I've routinely picked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but I've been switching things out in recent weeks. I'm going back to my original call this time around, betting on a strong week for tech now that earnings season is starting to wind down. This approach didn't pan out for me this past week, but that won't deter me.

My second call is for the Nasdaq Composite to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the week.

3. magicJack VocalTec will beat Wall Street's earnings estimates

Some stocks are just flat-out better than others.

magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL) is a provider of Web-based phone services. Consumers looking to save money have been ditching traditional landlines, and the VoIP pioneer has sold 10 million of its magicJack devices.

Another thing it does is make analysts look like perpetual underachievers. If analysts say the company posted a profit of $0.19 a share in its latest quarter, I'll argue that it held up better than that. History's on my side!

One of my best tricks to beating the market is finding stocks that perpetually land ahead of the prognosticators. Let's go over the past year of earnings reports.

Quarter EPS Estimate EPS Surprise Q4 2012 $0.60 $0.95 58% Q1 2013 $0.51 $1.17 129% Q2 2013 $0.32 $0.49 53% Q3 2013 $0.42 $0.48 14%

Things can change, of course. Analysts are starting to catch up as the strength of the bottom-line beats have weakened in each of the past two quarters. This is a competitive market, and it bears pointing out that analysts see magicJack VocalTec earning less than half as much as it did a year earlier.

It's still hard to argue against the trend. Everything seems to be falling into place for another market-thumping quarter on the bottom line.###3600||###3601||Asian CEOs are mostly declining to take a stand on whether they will speak at an investment conference that has become contentious after the suspected death of Saudi journalist, a contrast with U.S. and European counterparts.###3602||The new Carl Icahn letter is out.

More to come...

Here's the letter:

CARL ICAHN ON EBAY

"WE BELIEVE BASED ON EVIDENCE WE HAVE NEWLY UNCOVERED THAT DONAHOE'S INEXCUSABLE INCOMPETENCE COST EBAY STOCKHOLDERS OVER $4 BILLION. READ OUR LATEST LETTER AND YOU BE THE JUDGE."

New York, New York, March 10, 2014 - Today Carl C. Icahn released the following open letter to stockholders of eBay Inc.:

We believe, based on our review of the evidence currently available in the public domain, including eBay's own statements, that the following assertions are indisputable. Stockholders: you be the judge.

? eBay CEO John Donahoe oversaw a premature sale of Skype at a diminished price that resulted in eBay stockholders losing over $4 billion as compared to the sale of Skype to Microsoft 18 months later.

? Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners? But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards. If middle management makes a costly error, they pay the price; if the CEO makes one, too often the "old boy" board covers it up and gives him a bonus.

Regardless, Microsoft clearly was interested in buying Skype but "walked away" because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Skype's founders.

? In 2009, Donahoe decided to sell Skype in, according to eBay, "a competitive process with multiple bidders including several financial and strategic buyers." [1] We are not sure whether there actually were "multiple bidders" as eBay originally stated or whether eBay merely "contact[ed] multiple financial and strategic buyers" [2] as they now claim.

? In litigation documents[3] that we have just uncovered, Skype's founders alleged that John Donahoe and eBay director Marc Andreessen's investor group received information from Mike Volpi, an associate of Skype's founders, that there could be a workaround of the technology that was the subject of the licensing dispute between eBay and Skype's founders and that was reportedly the cause of Microsoft "walking away."

? With the apparent benefit of this information, Andreessen's investor group purchased a controlling interest in Skype from eBay for $1.9 billion. The Andreessen investor group then quickly settled the licensing litigation with Skype's founders, and flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion - tripling their money in only 18 months. The obvious unanswered question is: why didn't Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype's founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?

? To make matters even more embarrassing for Donahoe, Marc Andreessen boasted upon the announcement of the sale to Microsoft that his group's risks in buying Skype had always been less than they had appeared. He said that he "knew that for Microsoft and a number of other companies Skype would be an obvious thing to buy" and that he "[would] always have the fall-back of selling to strategic buyers."[4] Obviously, the same logic should also have applied to Donahoe. Therefore, why did he sell Skype to the Andreessen investor group instead of keeping the $4 billion for stockholders (it would have been interesting to see Donahoe's face when Andreessen actually boasted about his windfall)? The board and Donahoe, in typical PR speech, have swept this $4 billion fiasco under the rug and have actually boasted about their success in executing this transaction between eBay and the Andreessen investor group. However, Joe Nocera of the New York Times does not appear to have been fooled by eBay's PR machine. At the time of the sale to Andreessen's group, he wrote: "And so, the mystery of the Skype deal: why were the winning bidders willing to pay so high a price for a company whose very existence could be threatened by this lawsuit? One possibility is that they have nerves of steel. The other is that they know something nobody else does."[5]

? Amazingly, Donahoe chose to sell a controlling interest in Skype to Andreessen's investor group, allowing them to reap billions at the expense of eBay and its stockholders, rather than cleaning up the licensing issues and then pursuing a more lucrative exit, such as an IPO or a sale to a strategic buyer.

? Any first year student in finance would understand that if you want to sell a company and you have a party that wishes to buy but is concerned about technology licensing issues, you fix the issues and then you sell. It's even more absurd not to do so when you know there is a potential solution. I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion.

? I have been so successful with companies over the years because I have brought in the right CEO. Sometimes convincing boards to make changes takes years, but when change ultimately comes the results are often startlingly good. In just the last year, simply examine our successes at Forest Laboratories and Chesapeake Energy etc. We believe that at the very least, eBay stockholders must send Donahoe and the board a message that we are very unhappy with the current situation at eBay. In addition to the egregious issues surrounding the Skype situation, it should also be noted that in just the past year eBay has underperformed its peers. Indeed, from January 1, 2013 through our initial involvement on January 10, 2014, Amazon, Visa and MasterCard returned 60%, 48% and 73%, respectively, while eBay stock returned only 2%.

? In our opinion, eBay and PayPal should immediately be separated. It is my firm belief that if this occurred, there would be a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal. However, on the other hand, I fear that if left under the management of eBay it will "wither" (as Elon Musk said). I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL - the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola's board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies - ultimately resulting in a sale to Google.

PayPal must be separated NOW

? Sadly in our opinion and the opinion of others eBay does not have years to wait. PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google, Apple, Visa, etc. To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal.so that great management can be attracted - management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.

CONCLUSION

The true owners of eBay cannot and should not tolerate any longer the behavior exhibited by CEO John Donahoe and the board as detailed above. We believe that eBay is the quintessential example of what is wrong with corporate governance at many of our public corporations and why the system is dysfunctional. If we, as stockholders, do not send a clear message to the eBay board that we will no longer tolerate the internecine relationships that have come to be accepted as commonplace at eBay, and perhaps more importantly, if we continue to follow the advice of Donahoe, even in light of the transgressions regarding Skype as well as the other failures outlined above, and allow him to continue to lead both eBay and PayPal, and if PayPal fails (as Elon Musk and others far more knowledgeable than me have warned), then investors that own shares in the institutions and funds that control the voting of eBay stock will have every right to cast the blame on everyone who failed to vote for change at eBay.

THE TIME HAS COME TO SEND THE EBAY BOARD A MESSAGE THAT THERE WILL NO LONGER BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT EBAY! VOTE FOR OUR PRECATORY PROPOSAL AND FOR OUR DIRECTOR NOMINEES.

Sincerely,

Carl C. Icahn###3603||Empty###3604||Why did this happen?

Russia supplies the majority of Ukraine’s natural gas and Ukraine serves as a critical transit route for sending Russian natural gas via pipeline into Europe.

Aware of its reliance on Russia, and seeking energy independence, Ukraine has taken several steps to move away from the grip Moscow holds over its energy supplies. In addition to reducing its use, Ukraine — which pays some of the highest natural gas prices in Europe — is seeking supplies from other sources and has signed deals to develop its own resources.

In November, weeks before Kiev was due to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union (EU), then-President Yanukovich backed away from the European integration deal in favor of repairing economic ties with Russia. Putin threatened trade measures against Ukraine if it signed the EU deal as planned in late November.

Exercising a form of energy blackmail, Russia offered cheaper gas if Ukraine would join Putin’s Eurasian Customs Union. Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told Bloomberg: “No one other than Russia can provide Ukraine with the necessary funds so quickly and in such a quantity. A gas agreement could help relieve Ukraine of a huge problem. We can also give them a loan, but we will not help them without commitments on their part.” The Bloomberg report continues, “Joining Russia’s customs union would shrink its current account gap by cutting energy costs.” Armenia joined the Eurasian Customs Union in September and, according to Shuvalov, is now getting “a specific price for gas because they’re signing the whole package of agreements on the customs union.”

Moscow sees that its natural gas supplies are a weapon it can wield against Ukraine. The Christian Science Monitor states: “By cutting a deal for discount gas with Russian President Vladimir Putin last November, Ukraine infuriated its pro-Europe contingent and entrusted its energy security to a fickle ally.” Former U.S. Ambassador to Poland Lee Feinstein adds: “It was at its most a short-term benefit, but in the long run served only to deepen Ukraine’s reliance on Russia.”

Because of Ukraine’s “reliance on Russia,” Moscow was able to exert diplomatic pressure that forced Yanukovych to back out of the trade agreement with the EU and accept terms that thwarted Ukraine’s independence and sparked the protests.

Other Eastern European countries have been watching and are taking steps to reduce their dependence on Russia and they see LNG as their salvation.

Poland is due to complete a large LNG import terminal on the Baltic this year — and Poland is already supplying some of Ukraine’s natural gas needs.

If President Obama truly wants to help our allies, he could have done so without firing a shot. Now that U.S. natural gas supplies are so abundant, he can expedite the permitting of U.S. LNG export terminals and encourage Congress to overturn the restrictions that prevent exporting natural gas to any country without a trade agreement.

The FT reports: “The EU’s access to American LNG exports is one of the most critical questions in determining Europe’s energy security and industrial competiveness.”

Ukraine knows that developing its own resources is imperative to its energy security. Being dependent on Russia for its natural gas has forced Ukraine to abandon a trade agreement with the EU—lessening its independence and renewing ties with its former master.

As this current conflict highlights, he who controls the energy controls the people — and this is exactly why America’s continued energy abundance is important for our own energy security and that of our friends.###3606||By Phil Wahba

March 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States.

The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent last month. That was below analysts’ average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.

U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast.

McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year “will pressure margins” in the first quarter.

McDonald’s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service.

That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald’s since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year.

Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year.

Thompson said in a statement that McDonald’s is “intent on improving our business performance.” McDonald’s said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes.

McDonald’s is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands’ Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos.

McDonald’s again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald’s less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages.

In Europe, the company’s biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region.

Analysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia.

McDonald’s shares were down 0.4 percent Monday morning.###3607||DigitalGlobe, the Longmont, CO-based satellite imagery provider, has once again turned to the crowd to help analyze its images as part of a disaster recovery effort, this time for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared Saturday.

DigitalGlobe is participating in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared Saturday while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing. The Boeing 777 jetliner was carrying 239 people.

For the search, DigitalGlobe is using its Tomnod platform, which crowdsources the analysis of satellite photos. Tomnod posts images and allows users to scan and tag features and landmarks. In this case, users would be looking for debris.

Xconomy ran a story on Tomnod in November, when the company used it to evaluate damage in the Philippines in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan.

According to the company’s blog, two of Digital Globe’s satellites on Sunday collected images of a 3,200-square-kilometer area in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea where the plane may have disappeared. The company has since expanded its search area as Malaysian authorities widen their search.

The story about DigitalGlobe’s involvement in the search was first reported in the Denver Post.

Trending on Xconomy###3608||NEW YORK: King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game “Candy Crush Saga”, expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

“Candy Crush,” which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion – slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

“I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock,” said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

“I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a skepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace,” said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

“The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark.”

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

ANOTHER ZYNGA?

“Candy Crush” launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra “lives”.

Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fueled by “Candy Crush” rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.

Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of “Farmville” waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of “Angry Birds”.

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in “Candy Crush” gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as “Pet Rescue Saga” and “Farm Heroes Saga”. About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a “substantial fan base” Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent.”

NYSE DEBUT

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KING” on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering. – Reuters###3609||Mercedes-Benz India today commenced local assembly of the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S Class at its Chakan facility in Pune, Maharashtra. Launched in January this year, 125 units of the new S Class were imported into the country via the CBU (Completely Built-up Unit) route.

Before the car's launch, all 125 cars found owners willing to pay the INR 1.57 crores asking price.

Thanks to the local assembly, the new S Class is priced at INR 1.36 crores (ex-Showroom, Mumbai), which is a reduction of about INR 20 lakhs compared to the launch price.

The model being assembled in India is the same S 500 petrol variant which was launched, while assembly of the diesel variant has not yet begun. We were informed by Mr. Eberhard Kern, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India, that aggregate parts of the engine and gearbox are also assembled in India along with the rest of the car.

As a result, the S 500 S Class is the most powerful car to be assembled at Mercedes's Indian facility, apart from being the only V8 powered car to be assembled here. The engine in question is a 4.7-liter V8 twin-turbo producing 453 bhp and 700 Nm of torque. A 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox channels this power to the rear wheels.

Germany's constitutional court has upheld the country's participation in a fund which can bail out troubled governments in the eurozone.

The court in Karlsruhe ruled today that being part of the fund did not violate the German parliament's right to decide how taxpayer money is spent.

Germany is the largest contributor to the fund because it is the largest economy in the 18-country currency union.

The court had already indicated in a preliminary ruling in 2012 that the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, did not violate German law, enabling President Joachim Gauck to ratify the treaty establishing the fund.

The court has referred another important question - whether the European Central Bank can make unlimited purchases of government bonds - to the European Court of Justice.###3616||Empty###3617||Empty###3618||Japan has become perhaps the world’s most important locale for bitcoin, the digital currency that was supposed to liberate its users from the tyranny of geography—and its government is playing catch-up.

This week the creator of bitcoin has been allegedly unmasked as a Japanese-born Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who was “descended from samurai and the son of a buddhist priest,” according to Newsweek. The media circus around Nakamoto, who has denied Newsweek’s claims, comes as the bitcoin world is still reeling from the failure of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which went from being the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange to an ignoble bankruptcy last week.

It was the failure of Mt. Gox that finally spurred prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government to issue its first major proclamation about bitcoin on March 7, and it’s fair to say that Japan’s stance is still a work in progress.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that bitcoin would be treated as a commodity, not as a currency, and “as a matter of common sense” it would be “natural” for the government to tax bitcoin transactions. But the government also said it was still gathering information on bitcoin—including an attempt to determine the total volume and value of bitcoins in circulation. The total number of Japanese bitcoin owners is also not clear.

“We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do,” Suga added.

Japan’s financial institutions have also been grappling with how to deal with bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mizuho Bank, which handled wire transfers and other business from Mt. Gox, repeatedly asked the exchange to shut down its account (paywall) because of an “unmanageable volume of money transfers,” many of them between Mt. Gox and its international customers.

The Japanese government issued a statement earlier this week that it does not prohibit financial firms from investing funds in bitcoin, but they are banned from exchanging between bitcoins and conventional currencies.

At least a few Japanese bitcoin owners are still optimistic despite the events of the last few weeks. Keiichi Hida of the Japan Digital Money Association, who lost¥100,000 ($980) when Mt. Gox failed, told Reuters, “We should make it a national project to have bitcoin used nationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” he said. “I think then everyone would come to Tokyo in an instant.”###3619||The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has exposed wide gaps in how the world’s airlines — and their regulators — operate. But experts warn this isn’t likely to be one of those defining moments that lead to fundamental changes.

For financial and technological reasons, and because of issues tied to national sovereignty, the status quo is expected to prevail in the way passports are checked, aircraft are tracked at sea and searches are coordinated.

In an age of constant connectedness, it is almost inconceivable to lose a large airplane for more than a week or to be in the dark about what happened on board around the time it went missing.

The reality is that large portions of the globe don’t have radar coverage. Over oceans, pilots fill in those gaps by radioing air traffic controllers at routine intervals with position updates. And while planes record sounds in the cockpit as well as speed, altitude, fuel flow and the positions of flaps, that information isn’t shared with anyone on the ground. Crash investigators only get access to the data on the recorders after combing through the wreckage, if they can find it.

Numerous experts have said it is time to update tracking abilities and use satellite links to provide real-time feeds on the operation of planes and conversations within the cockpit.

However, transmitting data by satellite from all 80,000 daily flights worldwide wouldn’t be cheap. Airlines made an average of $4.13 in profits per passenger last year and $2.05 in 2012, according to International Air Transport Association, the industry’s trade group. Any additional costs would eat into those slim profits. Some experts say planes don’t crash frequently enough to justify the cost.

If such information were to be streamed live, there would be major concerns about privacy says Robert Clifford, a personal injury lawyer in Chicago who has been involved in several aviation lawsuits. “Once it’s broadcast, the data from a plane would essentially be considered public access material — something that aircraft manufacturers, pilot unions, operators and even accident investigators don’t want.”

There is also a question of who would receive and control that data. There are concerns that an airline, plane maker or government worried about its reputation could meddle with the information.

“You can’t assume that there would not be strong economic interests to tamper with information,” said James E. Hall, former chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.

A compromise solution is to create deployable black boxes — data recorders similar to the voice and data recorders currently in planes. During a catastrophic event, they would break away from the tail, have their own homing devices and ideally be found quickly. But given the confusion over the Malaysia Airlines jet’s flight path, it is unclear if these boxes could help.

Then there is the search. The Malaysian government has been widely criticized for how long the search has taken and for its release of contradictory information. So why aren’t American investigators, who have a long history of dealing with plane crashes, taking charge?

NTSB investigators and experts from Boeing are on the scene providing technical assistance. So are U.S. military ships and planes. But politics and customs dictate that everybody takes a back seat to the local government.

The practice dates to a 1944 convention on international civil aviation in Chicago. Many of today’s rules of the sky were formed at that meeting, including one that puts the country where a crash occurs in charge of the search and investigation. If the airplane is registered in another country, that government is entitled to appoint observers to be present at the inquiry.

Hall says it is time for the International Civil Aviation Organization — part of the United Nations — to set up an international team of investigation professionals. “We can’t permit a situation to continue where we don’t have competent, independent people in charge of an investigation,” he said.

However, Kenneth J. Button, director of the Center for Transportation, Policy, Operations and Logistics at George Mason University, notes that even U.S. investigators have made mistakes in past disasters. Further, he can’t imagine countries such as the U.S. ceding the investigatory powers they currently have to some international group.

Flight MH370’s disappearance also uncovered another lapse: passenger passports were not checked against Interpol’s database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents. Most countries don’t run passports through the international policy agency’s computer system.

“It is not extremely unusual,” said Rafi Ron, a former chief of security at Tel Aviv’s airport and now head of New Age Security Solutions. To run the checks, countries would have to update software and link computer systems. “We’ve left a substantial loophole. There is only one thing behind it: cost.”###3620||Hello

The company, which started bringing its 2014 Mercedes S Class as a completely built unit (CBU) to India, has also rolled out its first locally assembled S500 from its Chakan plant. 2014 Mercedes S Class S500 originally priced at ₹1.57 crore (ex-showroom Delhi) is now available at ₹1.36 crore, which is about ₹20 lakhs cheaper than the CBU model.

The car draws its power from the 4.7l V8 engine, which can churn out a power of 455 hp at 5250 rpm and a torque of 700 Nm at 1800-3500 rpm. It is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and can accelerate from 0-100 kmph in just 4.4 seconds. The company claims a top speed of 250 kmph for its new luxury sedan.

The company sells a wide range of cars in India, such as A Class, B Class, sedans C Class, E Class, S Class and SLS AMG. Beside S Class, Mercedes also assemble E-Class, C-Class, GL-Class and the M-Class models locally in India.

"No other car stands for Mercedes-Benz brand promise more than the S-Class and we are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the art production facility in Chakan, Pune. Quality has all along been the strength of Mercedes-Benz India, and the new S500 production in India is set to take this success story even further," said Eberhard Kern, managing director and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India, according to AutoCar India.

Recently, the company opened its state-of-the art second dealership in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Mercedes Benz's new dealership Benchmark Cars is spread over a total area of 11000 sq. ft. The showroom offers facilities like customer lounge, accessories, collections display and easy one stop shopping. Currently, Mercedes-Benz India has 62 outlets in 35 cities, and the company is also planning to expand its network in the country.###3623||The Treasury has approved a major shake-up of the Bank of England senior leadership as governor Mark Carney makes his mark on the organisation.

Chancellor George Osborne has unveiled two new Bank of England deputy governors and a chairman of the court.

Ex-Whitbread and Bunzl chairman Anthony Habgood will replace Sir David Lees as chairman of court from 1 July.

On the same day ex-Goldman Sachs banker Ben Broadbent will step up from external monetary policy committee member to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy.

International Monetary Fund deputy managing director Nemat Shafik will also take up the newly created post of deputy governor for markets and banking from 1 August.

Shafik will become only the second ever female deputy governor and the only woman to sit on the monetary policy committee when she replaces executive director of markets Paul Fisher.

She will be responsible for the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing by the MPC. The new position will also oversee a range of role including a review of the Bank’s market intelligence functions and monetary framework.

Shafik will represent the Bank at international bodies such as the G7 and IMF. Shafik will also sit on the Financial Policy Committee, the Bank’s Court of Directors and the board of the Prudential Regulation Authority.

The Treasury says the appointment is a central plank of a package of structural and other changes to be announced by Carney as part of the Bank’s strategic plan.

Treasury select committe chairman Andrew Tyrie has hit out at the “Byzantine” structure of Bank of England governance and Carney is believed to be shocked at what he found when he took up the job last July.

Osborne says: “I am delighted to announce the appointment of three such highly qualified and experienced people to join the Bank’s already excellent executive team.

“Their impressive experience of business, economics and international finance will strengthen and diversify the Bank’s top team and enable them to continue to face Britain’s ongoing economic challenges from a position of strength.

Carney says: “With a diverse combination of skills and experience, these appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank – one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation for the institution and enable it to meet the challenges and opportunities it faces in maintaining monetary and financial stability.”###3624||###3625||On Tuesday, American Eagle Outfitters posted sharply lower quarterly profits, sending AEO stock slumping more than 5% in pre-market trading.

AEO stock sank after the apparel retailer said it earned just $10.5 million during its fiscal fourth quarter, a drop of 89% compared to the profit of $94.8 million it turned in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS came in at 27 cents, a penny above the earnings of 26 cents a share that the company had predicted in January, the Wall Street Journal noted.

Same-store sales tumbled 7% during the quarter, though its AEO Direct online division saw sales climb 8%. Overall, AEO reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.04 billion, which narrowly beat analysts who were looking for $1.03 billion.

AEO interim CEO Jay Shottenstein called AEO’s performance for 2013 “highly disappointing,” conceding that AEO “fell short of expectations” in both customer experience and merchandise.

For the current quarter, anticipates break even adjusted earnings per share. Analysts have estimated earnings of 13 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter.

AEO stock closed at $14.21 a share on Monday.

The world’s airlines are scheduled to offer 317.4 million seats this month, according to OAG, a UBM Aviation company, in its April OAG Frequency and Capacity Trend Statistics (FACTS) report. This figure, the highest ever airline capacity for April, is 5% more than the same month in 2010, or 13.9 million more seats, and represents a 1.25% rise in the average number of seats per flight schedule. Frequencies, too, are showing significant growth with a 3% rise, or 80,653 more flights scheduled to operate worldwide in April 2011 compared to April 2010.

The fastest growing market by volume of seats is to and from the Middle East, with an 11% increase in capacity year on year. However, political events in the region will likely have an effect on sustaining this level of scheduled capacity.

In terms of absolute growth, the intra-Asia Pacific region is the clear leader with more than 6.2 million additional seats and 40,203 more published flights this month against April 2010. Over the last five years, figures within the Asia Pacific region have shown average capacity growth of 7% compared to the global average of 4%.

“Japan is such a major influence on the world stage and no region will be immune from the effects of the devastation. That, along with the prevailing economic pressures and concerns about rising oil prices, are certain to impact ongoing demand,” said Peter von Moltke, Chief Executive Officer, UBM Aviation.

The only regional market showing a reduction in overall frequency this month is for flights to and from Central & South America, although this drop is less than 1% and an improvement on March figures when the reduction was 2.7% year on year. In sharp contrast, the low cost sector is bucking this trend. Growth in frequencies and available seats on low cost carriers is higher to and from Central & South America than for any other region this month, up by 28% and 27% respectively.

Analysis of the European market reveals marginal growth of 0.3% in frequencies and just 2% in capacity for services within the region. Even the low cost sector shows modest growth this month with 3% more seats available year on year, compared to a 7% year on year increase in March. Madrid, Cologne, Athens and Stansted all showed a large absolute decline in capacity this month compared to April 2010 with -3%, -15%, -12% and -14% respectively.

“European aviation has been relatively robust in meeting the industry-wide challenges of the last decade, however increased competition from rail operators and a variety of taxation changes in major EU markets are starting to take their toll,” continued von Moltke.

April figures from OAG show UK domestic services are taking a big hit with a 14% drop in overall capacity and an 18% drop in available seats on low cost carriers. Germany, too, shows a significant reduction in capacity this month, with 5% less domestic capacity overall and 11% fewer low cost seats available.

“UK Air Passenger Duty, although frozen until 2012, continues to have an impact on business and leisure air travel demand, and we expect to see further reductions in UK domestic services in our May figures,” von Moltke added.

While North America’s domestic air service has grown at 2% for the month, it is the only region to record a drop in numbers against April 2002, with both frequency and capacity figures down compared to a decade ago. Additionally, for the first time, low cost carriers (LCCs) now represent over 30% of available capacity of the domestic US market.###3630||###3631||London (AFP) - Vodafone agreed Monday to buy Spanish cable firm Ono as the British mobile phone giant stepped up its expansion in Europe using the proceeds from the sale of its US joint venture stake.

The London-listed group will purchase Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) including debt, it announced in a statement.

Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create a market leader in Spain.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said chief executive Vittorio Colao.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."

- Vodafone in 'shrewd' move -

The acquisition marks Vodafone's latest move to grow in Europe following its recent 7.7-billion-euro takeover of Kabel Deutschland, the largest cable operator in Germany, and amid fast-moving consolidation within the industry.

"This is another shrewd strategic move for Vodafone which brings with it the fixed line operation they were lacking in Spain," said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor.

"Expect more strategic acquisitions from the telecoms goliath as the array of European operators looks to consolidate," he told AFP.

The Ono transaction, worth Â£6.0 billion, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.

"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect.

"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."

Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.

Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.

"Strategically, Vodafone buying cable operator Ono makes certainly sense especially as it puts them into a better position to compete with Telefonica and Orange," added analyst Markus Huber at brokerage Peregrine & Black.

"Also, it follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services."

- Shares rally in reaction -

Investors welcomed the news, sending Vodafone's share price 1.04 percent higher to 224.468 pence in Monday morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.43 percent to 6,556.11 points.

Vodafone had last year sold its 45-percent Verizon Wireless holding to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.

The British group, which is the world's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has vowed to invest Â£19 billion over the next two years on networks and services by March 2016.

The Ono transaction meanwhile marks the latest consolidation in the fast-moving global cable industry.

US giant Liberty Global took over its British rival Virgin Media last year in a deal worth $23.3 billion.###3632||Empty###3633||China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.###3634||Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

A third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage."We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up," Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday."It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. "I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention."The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

Editor's Note:

Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

In the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the "young invincibles" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families."They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car," she said. "In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information."Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance."They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," Corlette said. "The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up."It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it."Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. "If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story."Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the "Not-So-Sweet-16" reasons people aren't signing up."Cost" beat out all other takers including "Can't keep your plan," and "Limits on coverage."###3635||Empty###3636||Shares of both The Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (Nasdaq: JOSB) reached all-time highs today (Tuesday) following news that Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

MW stock traded as high as $58.80 today, while JOSB stock touched $64.63.

MW offered $65 per share for JOSB. That's up from Monday's closing price of $61.83.

The deal comes five months after Jos. A. Bank initially made an unsolicited $2.4 billion bid to buy Men's Wearhouse in October. At the time, Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer and countered with a $1.5 billion ($55 per share) bid for Jos. A. Bank.

The two retailers have been going back and forth since. MW upped its offer twice since the initial dealings and had most recently offered $63.50 per share. That was once again rejected by JOSB officials, who said they would accept a higher offer.

In January, Men's Wearhouse tried to put pressure on Jos. A. Bank by nominating two candidates to JOSB's board of directors. At the time, JOSB still wouldn't budge.

The combined companies will operate more than 1,700 stores in the United States and employ 23,000 people. The two brands will continue to operate separately following the deal.

Officials project sales to reach $3.5 billion for the retailer.

Jos. A. Bank had an $825 million deal to acquire retailer Eddie Bauer in the works, but is terminating that purchase after today's deal. The company is also axing a $300 million stock buy-back offer.

Now that the deal has finally been made official, investors are wondering how to play MW stock moving forward…

The Future for Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) Stock

While they're both known as retailers of men's suits and professional wear, the acquisition actually creates the fourth-largest men's apparel retailer in the United States.

After the announcement, shares of MW stock were up 6% and shares of JOSB were up nearly 4%.

Investors who purchased JOSB stock back in October when the M&A talks surfaced are patting themselves on the back today. The offer price of $65 is a 51% premium from the stock's price in October.

While MW shareholders are pleased with the 6% bump they've enjoyed today, the future is a little cloudier, as some volatility can be expected in the short term.###3637||High-frequency trading, a business that has been shrouded in secrecy because its biggest firms were private, is coming out of the dark.

Virtu Financial Inc., the New York-based automated market maker that tried and failed to buy Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012, filed for an initial public offering Monday, disclosing that it had earned money every day but one in the last five years. The company is seeking a valuation of about $3 billion, about twice as much as rival KCG Holdings Inc., which was created last year in the merger of Knight and Getco LLC, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Business Insider reports:

“The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,” Virtu writes in the filing. “As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Here’s the chart of Virtu’s near-perfect record:

Thanks to two decades of regulatory reform and technology advances, firms such as Virtu and Getco supplanted human traders as the main providers of prices on stock and commodity exchanges around the world. Business has been good enough that Vincent Viola and Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s founder and chief executive officer, were able to buy the Florida Panthers professional hockey team last year.

“These are companies that show they are a solid, profitable, longstanding business and that there’s investor demand to be a part of it,” Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone.

“If we think back to 2008 and 2009, we never would have expected to see these companies go public, and doing so makes their financial statements available and open,” McPartland said.

CFTC Review

One of Virtu’s first disclosures as it seeks to go public: the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into its trading from July 2011 to November 2013, examining “our participation in certain incentive programs offered by exchanges or venues,” according to Monday’s IPO filing. Virtu said it doesn’t believe it broke any laws or CFTC rules.

Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

“High-frequency trading has been a highly debated topic for years,” McPartland said. “While there are certainly some bad apples out here, the majority of the firms are doing a good thing for all the markets in the way that they operate and by adding liquidity.”

Virtu provides quotes in more than 10,000 securities and contracts on more than 210 venues in 30 countries, the filing said. The company competes with firms such as KCG as well as New York Stock Exchange market makers such as Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Trading Revenue

While Virtu put the initial value of the share sale at $100 million as a placeholder used to calculate fees, the firm is looking to raise $250 million through the IPO, a person familiar with the matter said. The company is seeking a valuation of as much as $3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the process is still private.

Chris Concannon, Virtu’s president and chief operating officer, declined to comment on the company’s valuation.

The trading firm’s total revenue last year was $664.5 million, according to the filing, an 8% rise over the previous year. Net income was $182.2 million, more than double 2012’s earnings, when it recorded a charge for an acquisition.

KCG earned about $120 million on revenue of about $1 billion in 2013, according to a Jan. 31 press release. The stock is up 4.4% in 2014, including a gain of 2.2% to $12.49 yesterday.

Trading Income

The biggest chunk of Virtu’s trading income was from U.S. equities, bringing in $111.1 million in 2013, 27% of the total. The next-largest asset classes were global commodities at $94.9 million and global currencies at $81 million, the filing shows.

“It’s probably a pretty good time to go public,” said Mark Allen Coffelt, who manages $60 million as president of Empiric Advisors Inc. in Austin, Texas. “The general public is just starting to come back into the market. We’ve had two huge downturns in the last 10 to 12 years.”

Virtu has thrived as two decades of market reform and computer advances helped automated traders largely supplant humans on the floors of exchanges around the world. The company’s main business is market making, using software to provide standing offers to buy and sell stocks and other securities.

Global Expansion

The company started in 2008 by trading U.S. stocks and has since expanded worldwide and into assets including government bonds, currencies and futures. It’s only had one losing trading day since the start of 2008, the filing said.

Cifu told Bloomberg News in May that Virtu would consider an IPO, about five months after he unsuccessfully tried to purchase Knight.

“They’re a well-regard firm,” Larry Tabb, chief executive officer of market-research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a phone interview. “Virtu has developed very strong, cutting-edge technology, is multi-asset class and is very focused on cost and developing profitable business lines.”

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP will manage the sale. Its current owners, including Viola and private-equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, don’t plan to sell shares, according to the filing.

Among the firm’s directors are Richard Grasso, former chief executive officer of the NYSE, and retired Army General John Abizaid.

Volume Rebound

Trading volume for U.S. stocks are rebounding. About 6.9 billion shares a day changed hands on average in the U.S. so far this year, compared with a full-year average of 6.2 billion in 2013. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction-execution activities, Virtu said.

“The timing is good for them,” Yousef Abbasi, market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, a Westlake, California-based broker, said in an interview. “While financials aren’t boasting an impressive multiple versus the market, the financial technology names are.”

Following the offering, Virtu will have four classes of common stock. The Class A shares being sold in the IPO and separate Class C common stock will have one vote per share. Class B common stock and Class D common stock will have 10 votes per share, according to the filing. TJMT Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Viola, will hold all of the Class D stock and control the majority of voting power.

Nasdaq Listing

Virtu plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “VIRT.” It said it will be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules and therefore we will not have to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

Electronic market-making firms such as Virtu use automated systems to earn money off the prices that buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to offer. They depend on scale to make money given the compression between bids and offers during the past decade.

The company added an executive with an investment banking background last year, hiring Joseph Molluso from JPMorgan to serve as chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Molluso was a managing director since 2006.

Cifu mapped out a plan to add products and enter new markets during the interview with Bloomberg News last year, expanding at a time when some of Virtu’s rivals retrench. KCG said in October that it was eliminating about 5% of its work force.

SEC Job

Virtu’s Concannon was under consideration last year to oversee the SEC’s trading and markets division, according to people briefed on the discussions. Concannon met April 10 with SEC Chairman Mary Jo White to discuss the opening, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.

The SEC is studying high-frequency trading and said it will issue a review of the industry soon. The CFTC also began a review of HFT last year, asking for public comment on 100 questions about the industry. Virtu listed “extensive” regulatory scrutiny as one of its risk factors in the IPO filing.

“There’s just a lot of ambiguity and not a lot of regulation in that area of the market,” Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said by phone. “They’re so profitable, so the IPO could be beneficial, but it could hurt them by opening them up to more scrutiny and regulation.”

Bloomberg.com###3638||Empty###3639||Empty###3640||Mark Carney has warned that the Bank of England could not directly stop wealthy foreign buyers pushing up house prices by snapping up expensive properties in the capital.

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England governor admitted that the central bank lacked the "tools that would directly affect" cash buyers of property, who are typically wealthy foreigners. He also warned that the rising house prices in the capital could spread to the rest of the country.

"We have to be alive to that possibility," he said, adding that the Bank's concerns about the standard of underwriting for mortgages remain "quite high" but "vastly improved relative to pre-crisis levels".

Carney added: "Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen."

Ridiculous London Property Market Facts 1/ 10











However, the Bank governor refused to be drawn on the effects on the housing market of George Osborne's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, insisting that it is "still early days" and Bank officials are "watching closely".

Carney previously warned that about the limits of the Bank of England's influence on the housing market, telling the BBC last month: "The top end of London is driven by cash buyers. It’s driven in many cases by foreign buyers. We as the central bank can’t influence that."

“We change underwriting standards – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage. We change interest rates – it doesn’t matter, there’s not a mortgage, etc. But we watch the knock-on effect.”

Under questioning by MPs, Carney also defended his decision to change the Bank's forward guidance from seeing policymakers consider raising interest rates if unemployment rate fell to a 7% threshold to instead considering it based on 18 indicators. Tory MP Brooks Newmark mocked the decision as a "bait-and-switch" for what he called "fuzzy" guidance over interest rates.

Carney said: "The key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time."

"I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target."###3641||###3642||###3643||Why did this happen?

March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.###3645||DENVER (AP) — Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn’t guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado’s budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world’s first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay’s marijuana program is still under development.

“Colorado’s going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn’t,” said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana’s tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado’s pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado’s pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state’s unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year’s pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it’s unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado’s Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

“There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado’s 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia Airlines believes the co-pilot aboard the missing plane spoke the last words to ground controllers.

Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that initial investigations indicate that co-pilot is the one who calmly said, "All right, good night."

Officials previously have said that those words came at a point in the March 8 flight when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off.

The timing of the last words has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance.

In another sign of continued pressures facing the fast-food industry, McDonald’s Corp. on Monday reported disappointing monthly same-store U.S. sales, its fourth-straight month of declines despite its aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games where it plugged products like its $5 20-piece chicken nuggets.

mcd Your browser does not support iframes. McDonald’s one-year stock chart

Like retailers across the board, McDonald’s /quotes/zigman/233369/delayed /quotes/nls/mcd MCD again cited weather as a negative factor. But that’s not all. The absence of real per capita disposable income growth that has hurt retailers like Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT also has hurt restaurant chains like McDonald’s, analysts said. The company also has faced increased competition from fast-casual chains including Chipotle /quotes/zigman/395806/delayed /quotes/nls/cmg CMG and Panera /quotes/zigman/65095/delayed /quotes/nls/pnra PNRA . More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s struggling to make itself relevant for today’s consumers.

According to the National Restaurant Association’s 2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year’s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.

“The U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald’s hasn’t kept up,” Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.

A case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain Sbarro on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.

To reverse waning demand, McDonald’s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson also is “enhancing the breakfast experience” at the chain to create “more of a coffee culture.” After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory. It also will be offering a new Bacon Clubhouse sandwich featuring Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The company is also testing giving consumers the ability to customize their orders, taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.

U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters. Overseas, European comparable sales were up 0.6%, while sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, as well as a stronger dollar, which made its food more expensive abroad.

Without the weight of a stronger dollar, total world-wide sales would have risen 2.2% , instead of a 0.6% decline in February, the company said.

Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald’s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.

“We believe the current more challenging reality is reflected in valuation,” said Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein, who rates the stock overweight. “While not the strongest near-term performer, we expect

MCD to regain lost U.S. share in ‘14, and benefit from a European macro recovery.”

McDonald’s shares dipped 0.4% to $95.11 Monday morning. They are down 3.6% during the past year, the third-worst Dow performer. In comparison, Chipotle jumped 82%, while Panera is up 11%, during the same period.

It will have a potential market value of £4.6billion, smashing earlier forecasts of £3billion, when it lists later this year, offering 22.2 million shares at between £12.60 and £14 each.

Co-founder and chief executive Riccardo Zacconi stands to make up to £448million from the float.

Candy Crush was the most downloaded free mobile app of 2013 and has been downloaded 500 million times since its 2012 launch. In 2011 King’s sales were £39million but had surged to £1.1billion by 2013. King is also profitable.

Yet none of King’s 180 games are as popular as Candy Crush and 95 per cent of revenues are generated by just three games.

Some analysts are therefore concerned that King is reliant on too small a selection of games.

Officials have rejected a Wall Street Journal report that the plane may have flown for four hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers.

The paper said this was based on data automatically sent to the ground from the Boeing engines. But Malaysian officials deny that.

Transport Minister Hishammudin Hussein told a news conference: “Rolls Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS (the airline) and the investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised.

“Whenever there are new details they must be corroborated. Since today’s media reports MAS has asked Rolls Royce and Boeing specifically about the data; as far as Rolls Royce and Boeing are concerned, those reports are inaccurate.”

Officials also said reports of debris showing up on Chinese satellite images have come to nothing.

Amid mounting criticism, officials have also again strongly defended their search efforts, in what is being described as the most baffling mystery in modern aviation history.

It is an agonising wait for relatives of the 239 people on board.

Efforts to locate the plane are being hampered by conflicting reports about its possible flight path.

For more than a year, the Fed has kept monetary policy easy with assurances that its main interest rate won’t rise at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is no more than 2.5 percent. That guidance is almost obsolete: while unemployment is forecast to fall below the threshold this year, most Fed officials don’t foresee a rate increase until 2015.

Yellen’s challenge is to replace the threshold with guidance that’s less specific while also making it clear that rates won’t rise any time soon. If the Fed retreats to language that investors find vague and economic data comes in strong, traders are likely to move forward their estimate of when the central bank will raise rates, creating volatility in financial markets.

“Getting rid of the thresholds requires the committee to do something to keep the market in place,” said Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now senior managing director at forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington. “It is going to be quite volatile out there. What they are trying to do is prevent the markets from pushing up the timing of the rate increases.”

Junk Bonds

Volatility on interest rates of less than two years could have an impact on borrowing costs across the economy, especially on transactions where long-term debt is financed with short-term borrowing.

The Fed’s interest-rate thresholds have helped lower financing costs for companies whose bonds are rated below investment grade, or less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service or BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.

Yields on speculative-grade bonds have shrunk to within 3.82 percentage points of U.S. government securities on average, down from 5.29 percentage points when the Fed put the thresholds in place on Dec. 12, 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.

Analysts at Barclays Plc studied the market for two-year forward rates on two-year swap yields to measure the impact of expectations for changes in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, or the overnight rate for loans between banks.

Unemployment Forecasts

The analysis shows that volatility, or the expected size and frequency of interest-rate moves, remained low after the Fed put the thresholds in place and began to rise as unemployment fell closer to the Fed’s 6.5 percent goal.

“Less forward guidance could mean more uncertainty” about the path of the Fed’s benchmark rate, said Michael Gapen, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays in New York. “If it is volatility because we don’t understand their reaction-function, then that is not good.”

Unemployment was 6.7 percent in February, and the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a decline to 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in January from a year earlier, according to a measure watched by the Fed.

“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp” the Fed’s post-meeting statement “to take out that 6.5 percent threshold,” New York Fed President William C. Dudley, who also serves as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, said March 6 at an event in New York.

Carney’s Example

Fed President Charles Plosser called the threshold “obsolete” in a Feb. 28 interview.

The Bank of England offers one example the Fed could follow. The central bank refocused its interest-rate policy on spare capacity and a range of other indicators last month after unemployment fell faster than forecast toward the 7 percent threshold it set for considering a rate increase.

“Forward guidance is working,” BOE Governor Mark Carney said at his Feb. 12 press conference. “Expected interest rates have remained low even as the economy has recovered strongly. Uncertainty about interest rates has fallen.”

Three-month volatility for the pound versus the U.S. dollar fell to 6.17 percent on March 11, the lowest level since January 2013. It slid from last year’s high of 9.42 percent in July, before forward guidance was introduced.

Dudley called the BOE’s new guidance a “very good approach.”

Bond Purchases

“It was qualitative rather than quantitative,” he said March 6. “I think that is appropriate in the U.S. We are going to have to look at a broad set of labor-market conditions rather than one single indicator.”

Yellen and the FOMC can reach for other tools to guide markets on the outlook for the short-term rate.

The Fed could point to its bond-purchase program, which it is trimming at a pace of $10 billion per meeting. With the current pace of purchases at $65 billion a month and seven meetings left in 2014, the Fed won’t stop buying bonds until the fourth quarter.

Any increase in the short-term rate can be ruled out as long as bond purchases continue, because the Fed wouldn’t tighten policy with one tool while easing with another, said Michael Hanson, a former Fed economist who is now senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York.

“It’s going to be very difficult for them to think about raising rates before concluding the taper,” Hanson said, “so hiking this year is extremely unlikely.”

Hiring Plans

Yellen could also use her first post-meeting press conference to highlight a broader set of labor-market indicators. During testimony to Congress last month, she said the Fed must consider “more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.”

Minutes from the January FOMC meeting show the Fed staff watching measures of long-term unemployment, the share of workers employed part-time for economic reasons, and firms’ hiring plans for indications of labor-market slack.

The Fed could also rely more on policy makers’ quarterly forecasts for unemployment, growth, inflation and the path of the Fed’s target rate. The Fed will publish updated forecasts after next week’s meeting. In December, 15 out of 17 policy makers said the Fed wouldn’t raise rates until 2015 or later as the economy recovers slowly from the worst recession since the Great Depression.

The Fed can’t “avoid a certain amount of volatility” in short term rates as Yellen tries to pull back from the most explicit guidance in the 20-year history of the Fed’s post-meeting statements, said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas in New York.

“Their communication is going to have to be frequent, repeated, and clear, and they are going to be battling to hold the market back and prevent it from getting ahead of them,” she said. “That is part of this transition.”###3656||Share:

California -An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy.

The man who cobbled the deal together said Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990. ‘No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,’ said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a ‘well-known billionaire’.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen’s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said. ‘It was worse than any audit you can think of,’ he said.

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen’s policy. Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors. ‘He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,’ Frances said. Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances also said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire’s cash holdings.

‘Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don’t have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,’ Frances said. Frances said that the annual premium is in ‘the low, single digits of millions of dollars’.

He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Frances wouldn’t disclose the billionaire’s age. Several billionaires have connections to Frances’ firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder. Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other startups, declined to discuss with the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder. Forbes reports that California can lay claim to 111 billionaires, with about a third of them considered high-tech investors.###3657||Empty###3658||Empty###3659||Empty###3660||The head of the world’s biggest bond fund, Pimco’s Bill Gross has promised to loosen the reins of control over his portfolio managers just weeks after details of a heated feud between him and his former executive were brought to light.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal published details of an open-office argument between Mr Gross, who co-founded Pimco in 1971 and Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco’s chief executive, who was quoted saying “I’m tired of cleaning up your s---", in reference to conduct by Mr Gross he felt was hurting Pimco.

It has since been revealed in a Financial Times report Morningstar analyst Eric Jacobson, who recently met with Mr Gross, said the 69-year-old seems “very contemplative about mistakes he may have made in shaping that atmosphere in the past".

He added Mr Gross “has speculated there may have been a lot more silence in the room when he and Mohamed [El-Erian] were dominating the [investment] committee, because members of the group were anxious about taking positions that might upset one of them or the other," the Times reported.###3661||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada.

* Oil production at Libya’s El Sharara field restarted

* Coming up: API data Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) (Rewrites top, updates with settlement prices, adds analyst commentary)

By Jeanine Prezioso and Elizabeth Dilts

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil fell by more than $1 per barrel on Monday to a three-week low, pressured by an unexpected drop in China’s exports that stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

Oil prices were weighed by moderate temperatures that reduced the need for heating fuels and refinery maintenance season in the U.S., when demand typically wanes.

U.S. commercial crude oil inventories were forecast to have risen by 2.2 million barrels on average last week, according to a Reuters survey taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.

As well, oil on both sides of the Atlantic was pressured by easing fears over the crisis in Crimea.

“We’re rolling into refinery maintenance season and the market was bid up too far on the Ukrainian news,” said Paul Smith, chief risk officer with Mobius Risk Group in Houston. “I see no issue with U.S. crude going below $100.”

U.S. oil settled $1.46 lower at $101.12 a barrel, its lowest since Feb. 14. After two straight days of gains, Brent crude settled 92 cents lower at $108.08.

U.S. ultra low-sulfur diesel futures, more commonly known as heating oil, fell 4.5 cents to settle at $2.9674 per gallon.

With heating season coming to an end and refiners in maintenance season, traders and analysts expect that oil leaving Cushing will pool along the coast, forcing a temporary glut and capping prices until stocks are drawn down to make gasoline for summer driving season. Oil stocks in the Gulf Coast have risen every week over the last 1-1/2 months.

“We will continue to see draws out of Cushing, but I think we will see much larger builds on the Gulf Coast,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member of commodity trading advisor Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.

In line with maintenance season, refinery utilization for the week ending March 7 was expected to have fallen, though by less than last week, the preliminary survey showed.

The API will release its data on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).

China released weak data overnight that showed the No. 2 oil consumer’s exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier. Many risk assets and stock markets fell on the weak data even though it likely reflects a slowdown due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Copper prices hit an eight-month low.

Oil traders seemed to put tensions in Ukraine on the back burner, though Russia’s continued push to tighten its grip on Crimea was expected to keep markets volatile.

Brent oil was alternately supported and pressured by the ongoing crisis in Libya that has cut into oil output. Libya’s parliament has ordered that a special force be sent within one week to “liberate” all rebel-held ports in the volatile east, officials said on Monday, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenues.

Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and might reach full capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Business should not get “hung up” about when interest rates will start to rise and instead take confidence in the fact that they will increase slowly to a level far lower than they were before the crisis, a deputy governor of the Bank of England has argued.

Charlie Bean told business leaders in Darlington yesterday that the Bank would do its “utmost to ensure the recovery is not nipped in the bud”, warning that although the economy was “on the mend”, risks remained.

Growth cannot continue to be sustained by consumer spending and housing investment, he said. “We really want to see three things happen: business investment needs to pick up . . . a revival in productivity growth . . . and an expansion in net exports.”…###3667||It has been speculated for months, and now Alibaba has finally made it official: it will be going public in the United States. The company made the announcement on its corporate blog on Sunday.

"Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States. This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals," Alibaba said in a statement.

"Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China."

The company has not decided yet whether to list on the New York Stock Exchange or on the Nasdaq Stock Market,

Alibaba, which is the largest e-commerce company in China, had attempted to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but ran into trouble with regulators with it tried to have its partners nominate a majority of the board of directors, something that is not allowed under Hong Kong rules.

The company addressed the Hong Song issue in its statement on Sunday.

"We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group. We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong," Alibaba said.

Founded in 1999, Alibaba hosts a group of e-commerce businesses. They include a shopping search engine, B2B online web portals, data-centric cloud computing services, and online retail and payment services.

The company is so big that in 2012 just two of its portals made 1.1 trillion Yuan, or $170 billion in sales, more than eBay and Amazon combined. Total gross merchandise traded on Alibaba's e-commerce sites last year was $240 billion, the Wall Street Journal. To compare, Amazon made around $100 billion.

Its no surprise, then, that the Alibaba IPO is expected to be huge. The company is expected to sell roughly a 12% stake, which would translate to a $18.4 billion offering on a $153 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.

One big winner in this will be Yahoo. Despite selling back half of its 40% stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba in September of 2012, for a total of $7.6 billion, Yahoo still owns a sizable amount of the company’s stock, roughly 23%.

(Image source: whatsonchengdu.com)###3668||Four days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished somewhere between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, its fate remains unknown, adding a cruel uncertainty to the grief of the families and friends of the 239 people onboard.

Planes, ships and satellites from 10 countries — the United States for instance, has dispatched two destroyers, an oiler and a patrol plane — are conducting an extensive and expensive search. Yet much of the excruciating mystery surrounding the plane’s loss could have been averted if the recommendations ensuing from an earlier crash had been followed.

On June 1, 2009, an Air France Airbus A330 flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappeared off the coast of Brazil. It took five days to find the site of the crash — and two more years to retrieve the plane’s data recorders from waters some 3,900 meters (12,000 feet) deep.

Three years after that tragedy, France’s air-accident investigation bureau issued its final report, with more than 40 recommendations. Many relate to the specific circumstances that led to the plane’s crash, and it’s not yet clear whether they would be relevant to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

There is at least one area, however, where their applicability is glaringly apparent: the recording and transmission of flight data. In particular, the bureau recommended that the European Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organization “make mandatory as quickly as possible, for aeroplanes making public transport flights with passengers over maritime or remote areas, triggering of data transmission to facilitate localisation as soon as an emergency situation is detected on board.”

Such systems exist, but airlines have balked at the expense of installation (which one manufacturer put at less than $100,000 per aircraft) and the cost of transmitting and storing huge amounts of data. Yet the bureau was not recommending continuous transmission, but rather “triggered transmission” — when, say, there are unusual changes in a plane’s altitude (a steep bank, for instance), speed or proximity to the ground. A working group of more than 150 people gathered from manufacturers to regulators concluded that such a system could detect anomalies as they happen, and that “nuisance transmissions” — that is, false alarms — could be all but eliminated. The stream of data would not only make travel safer, but also help companies save money on maintenance and fuel efficiency. Cheaper but still effective would be off-the-shelf technology that continually transmits, in short bursts, just a plane’s position and velocity when it’s over water and out of radar range.

The International Civil Aviation Organization, an unwieldy group that moves more like an aircraft carrier than a jet, has so far not made triggered transmission part of its standards and recommended practices. Nor does it seem to have speedily adopted some of the report’s many other sensible recommendations — on coordinating and training for search and rescue efforts, for instance, or requiring all underwater locating beacons to send transmissions for 90 days.

Which leaves a question that will linger after Flight 370 is found: How many more planes will have to vanish before that happens?



###3669||Hertz (NYSE: HTZ) shares are getting a boost this morning after the Financial Times reported on Friday that the company was close to a $4.5 billion spinoff of its equipment rentals division.

The report is just now hitting the shares as it was released at 10:20 p.m. on Friday, giving investors a full weekend to digest the details. Hertz's rental unit accounts for $1.1 billion of the company's $8.2 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2013 according to the report, and $207 million of its $1.3 billion of pre-tax profit.

While Carl Icahn has denied having a stake in the company, many on the street still believe he personally has bought shares, whether or not its for his fund. This rumor will likely continue to circle around the company on Monday's session, so keep an eye out for possible Icahn sightings on the major networks, which could send shares on a run.

High-frequency trading business Virtu has announced details of its impending share sale.

The company revealed that it is to become a publicly listed company and aims to raise as much as $100 million (£60 million) as a result.

Virtu announced profits of $184 million (£111 million) in 2013, which was a 108 per cent increase from 2012 as high-frequency trading became more popular in the last 12 months.

The firm stated that it will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol VIRT and in its regulatory finding, the company said it has only recorded a single day of trading losses over the course of the past five years.

Virtu said: "We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad range of securities, and we generate revenue by buying and selling large volumes of securities and other financial instruments and earning small amounts of money based on the difference between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to accept, which we refer to as 'bid/ask spreads'."

Firm's dealings

It was added by the firm that it has provided quotes to buyers and sellers in more than 10,000 securities, as well as other financial instruments on more than 210 unique exchanges, markets and liquidity pools in 30 countries.

Virtu also argued that it serves an important role in maintaining and improving the overall health and efficiency of the global capital markets due to it "continuously posting bids and offers for securities and other financial instruments and thereby providing to market participants an efficient means to transfer risk".

Former New York Mercantile Exchange head Vincent Viola is the head of the company and he has plenty of experience in the financial market since leaving the US Army almost 30 years ago.

According to data released by the World Federation of Exchanges, the number of equity shares that were traded through an electronic order book grew at a compound annual rate of 13.7 per cent since 2004. This was a rise from approximately 3.5 billion shares in 2004 to approximately 9.8 billion shares in 2012.

In its urbanization plan for 2014-2020, the government said Sunday it will reform "hukou" registration, and improve water safety as well as air quality.

The "hukou" a complex household registration system discourages rural residents to move and settle in urban areas. Easing controls on residency status will unlock huge income potential and raise domestic demand.

"Domestic demand is the fundamental impetus for China's development, and the greatest potential for expanding domestic demand lies in urbanization," state news agency Xinhua said citing the plan from China's State Council.

China intends to increase the urban population to 60 percent from 53.7 percent in 2013. The urbanization process will boost investment in urban infrastructure and housing.

In an another release, Xinhua said the government will increase funding for railways, civil aviation network and improve connectivity among cities. The regular railways will cover cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020.

China also plans to permit local governments to issue municipal bonds in order to assist authorities to meet increased expenditure caused by urbanization.

Earlier in the day, the People's Bank of China loosened the trading band of yuan against the U.S. Dollar. The yuan will move as much as 2 percent on either side of the parity rate. It was set 1 percent in either direction until now.

The North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

Prime Minister Ali Zeidan’s government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels’ self-declared autonomous regional government.

But members of Libya’s parliament, the General National Congress, said that bad weather prevented the navy’s small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean from the port of Al-Sidra.

“The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow,” one GNC member told AFP.

Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC’s energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy’s warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

“The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,” he said.

The Morning Glory’s escape is a new humilation for the Tripoli authorities, who have struggled to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Kadhafi.

In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as regionalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.

The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital last October.###3674||Sbarro LLC, the pizza restaurant chain operator filed for a bankruptcy protection after the company incurred too much debt and experienced customer declines at its restaurants that are primarily located in shopping malls.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Sbarro’s lenders for a debt equity swap supported its intention to file for bankruptcy protection. The pizza restaurant chain operator submitted its chapter 11 bankruptcy application on Monday morning. This is the second bankruptcy protection filed by the company in less than three years.

Lenders support new management strategies

Sbarro indicated that 98% of its lenders voted in favor of the prepackaged plan, which allows them to exchange $140 million in debt to gain control of the reorganized company. Its CEO David Karam said the company’s agreement with lenders indicates their “support and confidence” to the growth strategies developed by the new management over the past nine months.

The group of lenders agreed to provide $20 million bankruptcy loan to Sbarro to finance its chapter 11 restructuring.

Sbarro’s pre-packaged plan

The pizza restaurant chain operator announced its plan to close 155 out of its 400 restaurants in North America last month as part of its initiative to reduce costs.

Sbarro’s prepackaged plan indicated that a combination of store closures and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability. The company also believed that the strategy will help reduces its outstanding debt by over 80%.

In addition, Sbarro will also put its business up for auction to test the debt-swap to ensure maximize recoveries for creditors. The company emphasized that it will immediately seek a confirmation for standalone reorganization if it does not receive better offers for its business.

Sbarro used its last stay in bankruptcy to reduce 70% of its liabilities. The company’s existing debt is $130 million, down from $400 million.

In the latter part of 2011, Sbarro emerged from its first chapter 11 bankruptcy after a debt-for-equity swap with lenders. It has 800 stores across 40 countries. Its current bankruptcy protection does not affect the 600 franchise locations worldwide. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.###3675||Last year, Americans used public transportation to take 10.7 billion trips. According to the American Public Transportation Association, ridership hasn’t been that high since 1956.

“It’s truly a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities,” says Michael Melaniphy, the group’s president and CEO, noting the growth started several years ago.

“Initially, when fuel prices spiked, it drove people to transit, and once they came, they decided it was good, and they stayed.”

There is a correlation, Melaniphy says, between high ridership and the health of the U.S. economy. Sixty percent of trips taken on public transit are work commutes.

However, Michael Moss, who directs the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, argues the other 40 percent is also important:

“Mass transit today is not just a peak-hour activity,” he says. As public transportation becomes more popular, and as cities spend more money on expanding it, transit systems are opening earlier and closing later.

“There was a time when you said, ‘I want to live near a good school district,’” Moss says. “Today, people want to live near a good transit connection.”

Moss is referring to young people especially, who are ever less likely to own cars.

Plain, old-fashioned capitalism will prevent a new cold war between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and Russia’s gobbling up of the Crimean region. Capitalism, plus the fact that probably not one American in a thousand could locate Crimea on a map, and even the most hard-headed US political analysts have trouble coming up with a decent definition of what US interests in Ukraine might be. Ad Policy

Helping to contain the crisis is the fact that Russia, Europe and to a lesser extent the United States are tied together in a powerful web of financial and economic ties that didn’t exist, say, during the real Cold War. Their influence runs counter to the many, many cries from hawks to impose tough economic sanctions on Russia, as if the giant Eurasian power were a small “rogue state.” The Washington Post, for instance, said in an editorial:

Some argue that the West lacks the means to damage the Putin regime or that the United States cannot act without Europe, but neither claim is true. Banking sanctions—denying Russians and their banks access to the U.S. financial system—could deal a powerful blow. Mr. Obama must respond to Mr. Putin with measures that force the Russian ruler to rethink his options.

But, as CNN reports:

Russia is the European Union’s third-biggest trading partner after the United States and China, with goods and services worth more than $500 billion exchanged in 2012. About 75% of all foreign direct investment in Russia originates in EU member states, according to the European Commission. In addition, Russia is the single biggest supplier of energy to the European Union. British energy firm BP is the second-largest shareholder in Russia’s leading oil producer Rosneft, and some of the biggest energy companies in Germany, the Netherlands and France are invested in a joint venture with Russian gas giant Gazprom.

And, in a lengthy interview in The American Interest, Zbigniew Brzezinski points with regret to the fact that British bankers, who have large deposits of Russian cash—particularly from Russian oligarchs—are resisting any sort of confrontation over Ukraine:###3681||As it stands today, Comcast is a massive service provider that controls home and business broadband offerings across a number of key markets.

Low-wage jobs unexpectedly a way of life for many

WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, many Americans followed a simple career path: Land an entry-level job. Accept a modest wage. Gain skills. Leave for a better-paying job.

The workers benefited, and the U.S. economy gained —better pay led to increased consumer spending, fueling growth.

But that path has narrowed as many of the next-tier jobs no longer exist. That means more lower-wage workers have to stay put. The resulting bottleneck is widening a gap between the richest Americans and everyone else.

It's part of why average inflation-adjusted income has declined 9 percent for the bottom 40 percent of households since 2007, even as incomes for the top 5 percent now exceed where they were when the recession began, according to the Census Bureau.

Official: Obama to push for more overtime pay

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama will direct the Labor Department to strengthen overtime pay protections for millions of workers, a White House official said.

The directive is meant to help salaried workers, such as fast-food shift supervisors or convenience store managers, who may be expected to work more than 40 hours a week without receiving overtime pay. The proposed change is part of Obama's effort to focus on closing the gap between the wealthy and the poor.

Under the new changes Obama is seeking, the Labor Department could raise the pay threshold for workers covered by overtime rules. Currently, salaried workers who make more than $455 per week are exempt from overtime.

NY comptroller: Average Wall St. bonus over $164K

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The average bonus paid to securities industry employees in New York City grew 15 percent last year to more than $164,000, the largest average Wall Street bonus since the 2008 financial crisis and the third highest on record, New York's state comptroller reported Wednesday.

Volvo earnings hit by new product launches, costs

HELSINKI (AP) — Swedish truck maker AB Volvo enjoyed strong sales in the fourth quarter, but its earnings were hurt by extra costs linked to the launch of new products, write-downs and restructuring charges.

Net profit in the last three months of 2013 fell to 548 million kronor ($86 million), from 869 million kronor in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose to 76.6 billion kronor, from 70.8 billion kronor in 2012.

The company said Wednesday it would continue cost-cutting measures during 2014, including 4,400 layoffs it had already announced, and will review its products portfolio.

Volvo said it expects a slight growth in overall demand, driven mainly by China and Europe, but added that 2014 will see a reduction in costs.

(AP) - While the use of buses, trains and subways is on the rise in many U.S. cities, ridership in the Portland region's much touted TriMet system has fallen off.



New data released by the American Public Transportation Association shows it was down 3.8 percent from the past year.



In 2013, TriMet recorded 98.8 million rides, compared to about 102.7 million rides in 2012.



TriMet's spokeswoman Mary Fetsch says the recent decrease is due to the elimination of the Free Rail Zone in Portland, fare hikes, more fare enforcement, and service cuts made during the recession.



The agency says it has added back more bus service in September and has restored frequent bus service on its busiest Portland routes. A new Portland-to-Milwaukie light rail line is also slated to open in 2015.



Ridership on MAX, the TriMet's light rail, saw the largest dip, 6.1 percent. Some 38.4 million trips were taken on MAX in 2013, about 2,000 less than the previous year.



TriMet bus ridership also decreased 2.4 percent, going from about 60.4 million rides in 2012 to about 58.9 million in 2013.



The area's commuter rail line saw more success. The Westside Express Service or WES, which connects Beaverton and Wilsonville, saw a 10 percent increase in ridership. Rides increased from 430,000 in 2012 to 480,000 in 2013.



Federal officials have previously hailed Portland area's public transportation as visionary, easy to use and a model for other cities. TriMet's bus and MAX routes carry a combined 312,000 riders on an average weekday.



Over the past two decades, ridership of TriMet has steadily increased until the Great Recession and then leveled. It declined, especially on MAX, between 2012 and 2013.



Other mass transit systems in Oregon also didn't see much rise in ridership.



The Salem-Keizer Transit, popularly known as Cherriots, also saw a decrease of 2.4 percent. And ridership of Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit aka SMART remained stagnant.



Nationally, public transit systems saw the highest total of rides since 1956 nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013. Cities such as Houston, New York, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego saw large ridership gains.###3687||BERLIN, March 18 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Tuesday a ruling by the Constitutional Court upholding the legality of the euro zone’s bailout fund showed that the government’s policies to stabilise the euro were right.

“The Constitutional Court has confirmed our course for securing the stability of the currency,” Schaeuble said in a statement.

“That strengthens credibility and creates confidence,” he said, adding that comprehensive rights enjoyed by the German Bundestag lower house served as a guarantee that decisions on the stability of the euro were democratically legitimate.###3688||Copper prices fell to their lowest level in four years on the Shanghai Futures Exchange on Monday, after tanking 5 percent, a move which analysts say underscores China`s bleak outlook following weak data and the country`s first ever corporate debt default.

(Read More: What that China debt default means to the market )

The most heavily traded copper futures contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent - its daily limit - to 46,670 yuan (USD 7618) a tonne.

The move followed a steep fall in the price of copper futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. May futures tumbled 4.2 percent to USD 3.0825 a pound, the heftiest one-day drop since December 2011, and the lowest level since July.

Analysts closely watch copper prices as a barometer for global risk appetite, as it is sensitive to macro-economic developments.

"I am a little bit concerned by it [copper`s fall]," Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance, told CNBC Asia`s Squawk Box on Monday.

"The [China] data wasn`t that impressive, and when you combine that with [last week`s bond] default, it presents a weak picture in terms of demand and ongoing ripples that that will cause. So copper did fall out of bed, which I think was something that was expected," he added.

Copper contracts for delivery May 14, on the Commodities Exchange Centre (CEC), over the past five days.

Copper`s swoon comes against a backdrop of worry about slowing Chinese demand, which has seen prices slump 9.2 percent year to date. China, the world`s largest copper importer, accounts for around 40 percent of global demand.

According to the Shanghai Futures Exchange, copper stockpiles increased for an eighth straight week last week, their longest rising streak in two years.

"Any kind of weakness in demand is going to highlight the fact that the market is potentially reaching a tipping point between supply and demand," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets in Australia.

"Broadly speaking, leaving out the global financial crisis, a shortage of copper caused by the growth of China has kept prices strong. Now as copper production is growing faster than demand, the market`s slight deficit could turn into a slight surplus - which will have a big impact on prices," he said, adding that in his view copper`s fair value sits between USD 2.75 and USD 3 a pound.

"Copper prices normally see strong technical support at USD 3, if we break below that it could move lower," Spooner added.

Official data released over the weekend showed China moved into a trade deficit for the first time in 11 months after exports fell 18.1 percent on year in February, provoking concern over the health of the world`s second largest economy.

Adding to the pain was benign inflation data showing consumer prices rose 2 percent in February, the slowest rate in 13 months. News last week of China`s first corporate bond default in at least 17 years delivered another hefty blow.

If so, you could say Bankrate.com's new survey is a sign of success.





The survey shows that well over half of all uninsured Americans plan on buying health coverage in 2014. And more than 60 percent of adults aged 18 to 29 -- the demographic key to the success of the Affordable Care Act -- say they will get insurance this year.





But pessimists may instead point to the 33 percent of uninsured Americans who say they won't be buying insurance, despite the threat of a fine at the end of the year, as a failure.





And a deeper look at the responses of those Americans who say they won't buy insurance shows what could be a major failing of the Affordable Care Act's roll out.





What's a subsidy?





According to the survey, roughly 70 percent of uninsured Americans are not aware that subsidies provided through the Affordable Care Act could reduce what they pay for health coverage.





"This is a staggeringly high percentage," said Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman in a release about the survey. "The government has spent over half a billion dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act and more than two-thirds of uninsured Americans still don’t know about the subsidies."





Many uninsured survey takers said they would not be buying insurance because they thought it would be too expensive.





In general, opinions about the Affordable Care Act appear to be souring. According to the survey, nearly 30 percent of Americans feel more negative about the health care law than they did a year ago. Just 13 percent feel more positive about it today.

NEW YORK (AP) Sbarro said Monday that it is filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, the struggling pizza chain's second trip through bankruptcy court in less than three years.



The filing comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures. The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.



It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.



Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.



Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to "allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy" as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.###3691||Why did this happen?

The Labor Department announced today that the unemployment rate fell from 7.4 percent to 7.3 percent in August, the lowest since 2008. The dip was not attributed to an increase in jobs but rather to a shrinking of the workforce as people stopped working or looking for work.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.

The Labor Department said Tuesday that employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November’s nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.

There are about 2.6 unemployed Americans, on average, for each open job, the report shows. That’s close to the ratio of 2 to 1 that is typical of healthier economies. The ratio of unemployed people to available jobs reached a record 6.7 in July 2009, just after the recession ended.

The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.

And a separate report by ManpowerGroup, the staffing company, found that U.S. employers are more optimistic about hiring this spring. Nineteen percent of companies surveyed said they planned to add jobs in the April-June quarter, the most since last fall.

Last week’s employment report showed 175,000 net job gains in February. That’s the number of people hired minus those who were laid off, quit or retired.

Tuesday’s government report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, provides more details. It shows the overall number of people hired each month, rather than just the net gain. It also includes data on the number of people quitting or being laid off.

Overall hiring slipped 0.9 percent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly 5 million people are hired each month.

The number of people who quit their jobs fell slightly last month, the report said, while layoffs ticked up.

The additional data in the JOLTs report illustrates how much churn is taking place in the job market. A healthier job market usually includes more people quitting and greater overall hiring.

Quits can be a positive sign because people typically quit when they have a new job or are confident they will find one. More quits also open up more positions for job-seekers.

Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has said the Fed is monitoring the quits and hiring figures as key indicators of the job market’s health.

Openings rose in January in construction, education and health care, and hotels and restaurants. They dropped in manufacturing and retail.

The New York-based probe is in its early stages, and the source did not elaborate on the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability.

Federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago, according to the source.

The source did not want to be named because the probe has not been disclosed publicly.

GM declined to comment on Tuesday. Shares of GM closed down 5 percent to $35.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.

Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM's ignition switch problems.

The problems in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.

The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.

GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.

The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc, said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.

One analyst said the recall could have a longer-term impact on GM. "The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share," RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said.

"Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM," he said.

TWO WEEKS TO RESPOND

GM is conducting an internal investigation into the matter and announced earlier this week that the probe would be led by Anton "Tony" Valukas, the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block.

The criminal probe of GM opened by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara follows an investigation conducted by the same office into Toyota's disclosure in 2009 of driver complaints of unintended acceleration by some of its vehicles.

Toyota has been engaged in negotiations with Bharara's office to settle that probe, which is also criminal, a source familiar with the investigation previously told Reuters.

The House committee examining the GM issue, led by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, gave the company and NHTSA until March 25 to turn over information about their responses to consumers' complaints about the problem.

The committee has asked GM officials to provide a briefing no later than March 18 on how GM has responded to reports of incidents since 2003 and its interaction with NHTSA since then on problems related to the ignition defect.

Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles, resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA.

That law also makes it a crime to intentionally mislead the agency about defects that lead to serious accidents.

The Justice Department can only open a grand jury investigation into such allegations at the request of the U.S. Transportation Secretary, according to the law.

"We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall," a Transportation Department spokesman said in a statement.

The person familiar with the criminal probe declined to discuss whether prosecutors were considering liability under the TREAD Act.

But not every publicly traded company falls into this category, with some experiencing significantly more government involvement in corporate decision making. Here, I'll look at four examples of shareholder -owned corporations where the government has a greater role than just as a regulatory body.

Mortgage giants

As the name implies, government sponsored entities (GSEs) have a relationship with the government that is more than the standard private corporation-to-government relationship. But after the financial crisis of 2008 and some changes to the financing terms in 2012, Fannie Mae (NASDAQOTH:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (NASDAQOTH:FMCC) are more in government control than almost any other shareholder-owned corporation.

After the set of GSE earnings, the U.S. government has recouped its full investment in the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In all fairness, the government does deserve some additional returns for taking the risk and supplying the capital as any other money lending corporation would expect had a private-sector company been willing (or even able) to supply the capital necessary to sustain the GSEs.

But the current arrangement with the government is even better for Uncle Sam. Even after returning all the funds lent by the government, Fannie and Freddie owe just as much money as they did before. This is due to an amendment put in place in 2012 that called for the sweeping of all excess profits of the GSEs into the Treasury without reducing the outstanding preferred stock owned by the Treasury. In effect, Fannie and Freddie shareholders cannot access any of the profits and, unless things change, will never be able to do so in the future.

Owners of Fannie and Freddie common and preferred stock are challenging the legality of the Sweep Amendment in court. Among those challenging the government are Bruce Berkowitz, manager of the Fairholme Fund, and Richard Perry, manager of Perry Capital. If these lawsuits are successful, Fannie and Freddie shares have the potential to increase 10 to 15 times based on both my analysis, and that of the far more recognized Bill Ackman, manager of Pershing Square.

Power to Greece

At first glance, Greece seems like the last place anyone would want to put money. Between high unemployment and ongoing government debt issues, Greece looks like the place that will balance out your capital gains. But sometimes, the most hated investments are the most profitable, and its hard to find a company more tied to both Greece and its government than Public Power Corporation.

As Greece's largest energy producer operating mines, power plants, and transmission lines, Public Power Corporation is essentially the Greek power monopoly. But this monopoly comes at a cost. The Corporation is also 51% owned by the Greek government, allowing the government to use it for promoting social and economic policy instead of seeking out maximum shareholder returns.

Upside comes from this company through two main ways. The first is a possible privatization plan. Most likely, the government would keep a minority stake, but the sale would allow the Corporation to seek out greater profits without as much focus on the effects of its policies on non-shareholders. The second way comes from an economic recovery in Greece, which would allow more electric bills to be paid, and increase total power consumption.

To buy shares of Public Power Corporation, investors will need an account allowing them to access the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Athens Stock Exchange.

Energy giant

Few companies have received as much increased name recognition in the past couple weeks as Gazprom (NASDAQOTH:OGZPY). Unfortunately, it's not the good kind of name recognition. Gazprom is the largest energy producer in Russia, and exports oil and natural gas to Europe.

Right now, the company is at the center of the Ukrainian crisis, as it's both majority controlled by the Russian government, and supplies the commodities that western powers are threatening to put sanctions on.

As a result, fear has set in around the company. The biggest risk here is political rather than financial. It's unlikely that any giant earning as much as Gazprom would just collapse, but the Russian government could take steps that would significantly reduce the value of privately held Gazprom shares.

I view the Ukrainian crisis as an opportunity to acquire Gazprom shares at a bargain basement multiple, and begin collecting a dividend. However, anyone interested in Gazprom needs to know that they are dealing with financial, as well as political, risks.

Government discount

All four of these companies are out of favor with the investment community due to high levels of direct government involvement in their businesses. As a result, investors willing to accept these political risks can acquire otherwise strong companies at major discounts.###3698||Six days after flight MH370 disappeared, the Indian Ocean has become the latest area that authorities will scour in an attempt to find the aircraft and her 239 passengers and crew that disappeared without a trace.

"It's my understanding that based on some new information that's not necessarily conclusive - but new information - an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney said yesterday, without disclosing the nature of the "information".

"We are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy," he told a press conference.

He continued: "There are a number of possible scenarios that are being investigated as to what happened to the flight. And we are not in a position at this time to make conclusions about what happened, unfortunately. But we're actively participating in the search."

"We're looking at information, pursuing possible leads, working within the investigation being led by the Malaysian government," Carney added.

His announcement follows a press conference in Kuala Lumpur where Malaysia’s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said a search involving 12 nations and more than 80 aircraft and planes had still failed to uncover any trace of the Boeing 777.

“There is no real precedent for a situation like this. The plane vanished,” he said.

Mr Hussein strongly denied reports that data from the plane’s engines showed that it had flown for a further four hours from its last confirmed location and may have been intentionally diverted.

Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that investigators in the US were examining whether the missing plane was “intentionally diverted” from its planned route.

The report said US counter-terrorism officials were examining the possibility that the plane’s course had been changed “with the intention of using it later for another purpose” and that its transponders were intentionally turned off to avoid radar detection.

It said said data downloaded automatically from the plane’s engines, suggested the plane flew for a total of five hours. Its final confirmed location was at 1.31am last Saturday, about 40 minutes after it took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport. At that point it was heading north-east across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on what should have been a six-hour flight to Beijing.

If true, the information downloaded from the plane’s Rolls Royce engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring programme, suggested the plane could have flown on for up to 2,000 more miles and reached as far as northern India or even the north-west coast of Australia. It would expand the possible search area almost limitlessly.

But during a press conference on Thursday afternoon local time, Mr Hussein rejected the reports. He said experts from both Boeing and Rolls Royce were assisting the investigation and that the last transmission received from the engines was at 1.07am on Saturday morning. It had suggested everything was normal.

“Rolls Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with Malaysia Airlines investigation teams since Sunday,” he said. “This issue has never been raised. Since today’s media reports Malaysia Airlines has asked Rolls Royce and Boeing specifically about the data. As far as Rolls Royce and Boeing are concerned those reports are inaccurate.”

He added: “Whenever there any any details they must be corroborated.”

Mr Hussein also denied reports in the Malaysian media which claimed the police had raided the home of the plane’s main pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, to determine whether or not he was encountering any psychological problems.

Earlier this week, Malaysia’s police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said investigators were focussing on four areas - hijacking, sabotage, psychological problems and possible personal problems of the passengers or crew. But Mr Hussein said: “The pilot’s house has not been searched.”

Neither Rolls Royce or Boeing have yet publicly commented on the report. Bill O’Sullivan, a communications manager with Rolls Royce, told The Independent on Thursday morning that any statement would be sent out by email if the company had one to make.

The report in the Wall Street Journal said the data has led investigators in the US to pursue the prospect that the plane may have been diverted by a pilot or someone else. It is unclear whether the plane reached an alternate destination or if it crashed, potentially hundreds of miles from where an international search effort has been focused.

Six days after the plane went missing, most reports had suggested that terrorism or hijacking had been largely discounted. But the report said the new data raised a “host of new questions and possibilities about what happened” to the plane and those aboard.

The report said US investigators remained “fluid” as to the causes of the plane’s disappearance and that it remained unclear whether investigators had evidence indicating possible terrorism or espionage.

The flurry of claims and denials came as an effort to locate the plane spread out over more than 27,000 nautical square miles. Search planes had been dispatched to a site believed to be the location of where a Chinese government agency website said a satellite had photographed three “suspicious floating objects” on Sunday. It is unclear why it took China so long to share the information.

The location was close to where the plane lost contact with air traffic control but by early Thursday afternoon local time, nothing had been found at the spot. The Associated Press said the head of Malaysia’s civil aviation authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, had confirmed no debris had been located by the Vietnamese and Malaysian plans dispatched there.

“We are in the middle of a multinational search involving many countries and more than 80 ships and aircraft. This is a crisis situation. It is a very complex operation and it has not always been easy,” said Mr Hussein, the transport minister.

Earlier on Thursday, China continued to put pressure on Malaysia. Of the 239 people on board, more than 150 were from China. China has criticised Malaysia for the slow pace of the operation and what it has called conflicting information about the search.

Speaking in Beijing, Premier Li Keqiang, called for the “relevant party” step up coordination while China’s civil aviation chief. “We will not give up on any suspected clue that has been found,” he said. “This is an international and large-scale search operation involving many countries.”

The last definitive sighting on civilian radar screens of MH370 came at 1.31am on Saturday, less than an hour after the plane took. On Wednesday Rodzali Daud, the Malaysian air force chief, said a dot was plotted on military radar at 2.15 a.m., 200 miles north-west of Penang Island off Malaysia’s west coast at the northern tip of the Strait of Malacca.

But he stressed that there was no confirmation that the dot on the radar was Flight MH370. He said Malaysia was sharing the data with the US Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Security Board.

Malaysia Airlines has said that as a mark of respect to the passengers and crew on board MH370, the MH370 and MH371 flight codes are to be will be retired from Kuala Lumpur- Beijing-Kuala Lumpur route.###3699||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- U.S. stock futures were drifting lower Monday as the markets looked to take a breather after the S&P 500 finished at yet another record on Friday as investors continued to cheer an upbeat U.S. jobs report but also considered a spate of downbeat economic headlines from China and Japan.

-- Written by Andrea Tse in New York###3700||Investing.com -

Investing.com - Gold prices extended gains from the previous session on Tuesday, as lingering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine continued to support safe haven buying.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery held in a range between $1,338.10 a troy ounce and $1,348.10 an ounce.

Gold last traded at $1,346.80 an ounce during European morning hours, up 0.4%, or $5.30. Gold futures advanced 0.25%, or $3.30 an ounce, on Monday to settle at $1,341.50.

Prices were likely to find support at $1,319.30 a troy ounce, the low from February 28 and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.45%, or $0.09 cents, to trade at $21.00 a troy ounce. Silver ended Monday's session down 0.09%, or $0.01 cents, to settle at $20.91 an ounce.

Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven assets.

Gold gains were limited amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually reduce the pace of its asset purchase program.

Data released last week showed that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.

The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the Fed is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

Market players will be anticipating what will be closely-watched U.S. data on retail sales and consumer sentiment later in the week for further indications of the strength of the economy and the future course of monetary policy.

Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery inched up 0.6% to trade at $3.049 a pound.

Copper plunged to an eight-month low of $2.995 a pound on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.###3701||Libya's navy opened fire on Tuesday on a tanker after it had loaded oil at a rebel-held port in the east of the country, damaging the vessel, a Libyan military spokesman said.

Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney will meet with the Treasury Select Committee to answer questions on the "economics of currency unions" amid debate over the possible implications of a Scottish vote for independence.

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK.

First Minister Alex Salmond's Scottish Government wants to create a "sterling zone" with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Mr Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to how this is done in the eurozone.###3705||Empty###3706||A Chinese agency said a satellite found “three suspected floating objects” in the ocean northeast of Kuala Lumpur and south of Vietnam — or the “suspected crash area” of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370.

NAPLES, Fla. -- Hertz plans to spin off its equipment rental business into a separate publicly traded company.

The car rental company says it will receive about $2.5 billion in net proceeds as part of the transaction and plans to use it to pay down debt and to support a new $1 billion stock buyback. Hertz also reported a smaller loss for the fourth quarter.

Its shares fell in premarket trading Tuesday after rising earlier.

The new business will be called Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. The company rents equipment such as air compressors and tools, earthmoving equipment and power generators, forklifts and material handling, pumps, and trucks and trailers. It also sells new and used equipment and its Hertz Entertainment Services unit rents lighting and related aerial products used mostly by the U.S. entertainment industry.

Hertz Equipment Rental has approximately 335 branches in the U.S., Canada, France, Spain, China, Saudi Arabia and through international franchisees. It had more than $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013.

The spinoff will leave Hertz with the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly rental car businesses and Donlen, which provides fleet leasing and management services. The company has about 11,555 rental locations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and New Zealand. Last year the rental car and fleet leasing business had $9.23 billion in revenue.

Its board has approved the separation plans. Mark Frissora will remain Chairman and CEO of Hertz.

The equipment rental company will determine its management and board as separation plans are finalized.

Hertz Global Holdings Inc. anticipates the spinoff closing by early next year.

The new $1 billion stock repurchase program replaces a $300 million buyback announced last year. Hertz used about $87.5 million under that buyback.

Its stock slipped 28 cents to $26.94 in premarket trading about 2 hours ahead of the market open after initially rising as high as $28.

The company also reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results on Tuesday. For the three months ended Dec. 31, Hertz lost $600,000, or had breakeven per share results. A year earlier it lost $36.8 million, or 9 cents per share.

Excluding certain items, earnings were 26 cents per share.

Revenue climbed 10 per cent to $2.56 billion from $2.32 billion.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of 32 cents per share on revenue of $2.61 billion.

For the full year Hertz earned $346.2 million, or 76 cents per share. That compares with $238.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the previous year. Adjusted earnings were $1.63 per share. Annual revenue increased 19 per cent to $10.77 billion from $9.02 billion.

Hertz foresees 2014 adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $2 per share, with revenue in a range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion. Wall Street anticipates earnings of $2.07 per share on revenue of $11.6 billion.###3709||by

Ruth Liew Former Macquarie banker Joe Lee and Wall Street investment adviser George Samman suspected something was wrong with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox in the closing months of 2013. The founders behind Singapore-based derivatives trader BTC.sx had begun withdrawing money as early as December, fearing the premium Mt.Gox users paid for Bitcoins was a sign of liquidity issues at the Tokyo-based exchange. But it didn’t stop Lee and Samman from sustaining a six-figure loss when Mt.Gox finally went under last month. “We were one of Mt.Gox’s biggest customers but we got no inside ­information from them at all," says ­Samman, chief operating officer at the trader. “They couldn’t answer any questions so it was useless. We were lucky to get off what we needed to get off before the whole thing went down."

In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox. Advertisement

An IT entrepreneur who is building his own Bitcoin exchange, Kloppenborg lost $47,000 in the collapse. “I realised something was wrong much earlier on – I threatened legal action, and said I’d call the banks," he says. “It became a waiting game when I realised that the money was essentially frozen." Series of Bitcoin problems The failure of Bitcoin’s most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).

For a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US ­dollars to the thousands in just five years – to be worth $US10 billion at its height – the loss of 744,000 Bitcoins (worth $527 million at Monday’s average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service. And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system’s code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox’s former chief Mark Karpeles , publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1 million. The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox’s collapse is more fraud than theft, but provides ­little hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned. In an email trail seen by The Australian Financial Review between ­Kloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the exchange admitted it was unable to process ­Bitcoin withdrawals quickly due to difficulty dealing with major banks.

It’s a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed. “It’s still quite difficult to buy ­Bitcoins," says Parrish, a software en­gineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells ­Bitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders. Average price steady However, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox’s failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox’s own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its price remains volatile but it seems those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it. “People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin," says ­Samman. “But I think it’s a short-term negative and long-term positive.

“You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past." Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned ­Bitcoin while China has restricted how banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in New York float the idea of a ­Bitcoin licence. No plans for Australian regulations In Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was “not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator".###3710||Empty###3711||We were there when Hunter Ellis was given his new playhouse at the Home, Garden and Remodeling Show at the Kentucky Expo Center.

Sun Pharma spokesperson Mira Desai told in-Pharmatechnologist.com the alert “has a negligible impact on company-wide revenues,”​ and would be unlikely to cause any shortages in the US.

The news sees Sun Pharma join a growing list of high profile Indian drugmakers who have had products headed for the US banned due to GMP violations.

All four of Ranbaxy’s facilities in India are subject to the alert – the API plant in Toansa​ becoming the latest to fall under the ban in January - whilst two of Wockhardt facilities​ fell under the import ban last year.

The FDA has spoken at length about ensuring quality from Indian suppliers, and Commissioner Margaret Hamburg visited the country last month in part to address this issue. A Statement of Intent was signed pledging cooperation in ensuring compliance between the US and Indian authorities, and the FDA has also said it would up the number of inspectors in the country​.

This specific Import Alert (66-40) cites 33 facilities in India where product imports are banned from. However, whilst much recent emphasis has been on India, 31 facilities in China are also affected by the ban.

The decision on the lock-out comes after failure of talks between the management and the workers union over wage negotiation followed by labour unrest in the factory premises. Toyota Kirloskar Motors says that the management and the union have been discussing the charter of demands for the fiscal year 2013-14 for the past 10 months.

As a bipartite agreement was not reached, the Labour Department of the Karnataka government conducted seven tripartite meetings to reach a settlement but these have not yet resulted in an agreement.

In the meantime, the company claimed that a certain section of employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days. All these details have been listed in the lockout notice.

As a result, TKM says it was left with no other option but to declare a lockout to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel.

Toyota has two manufacturing units at its integrated factory complex in Bidadi industrial estate, which boasts of a combined annual production capacity of 310,000 units.

With the company on the verge of launching the new Corolla, their only 'real' new product launch in India soon followed by the Etios Cross and a few facelifts, the news does come as a setback for the car manufacturer.

Australian dollar May Face Selling Pressure on Pro-Taper FOMC Outcome

Geopolitical Tensions Threaten to Unleash Sentiment-Driven Aussie Volatility

A timid economic calendar on the domestic front is set to put external forces at the forefront for the Australian dollar in the week ahead. The spotlight is the March FOMC monetary policy meeting, this time to be accompanied by an updated set of official economic projections from the Federal Reserve and Janet Yellen’s first outing at the Chairman press conference. Straight-forward fundamentals may be undermined by the presence of geopolitical risk however which may set off sporadic bouts of risk aversion and undermine follow-through.

The markets have grappled with a difficult conundrum since mid-January: on one hand, US economic news-flow increasingly underperformed relative to consensus forecasts; on the other, the Federal Reserve remained steadfastly committed to “tapering” its QE stimulus effort. Central bank officials have argued that the soft patch in US performance looked to be transitory and did not offer substantive-enough evidence to alter the course of monetary policy. Having now monitored the situation for reasonable period of time, the Fed will have an opportunity to express its views in hard numbers and explain its thinking.

An upbeat set of economic forecasts that belies a firm commitment to continued stimulus reduction couched in similarly-themed rhetoric from the Fed Chair is likely to put the disparity between the direction of US and Australian monetary policy in stark relief. Whereas the RBA has opted for a “period of stability” over the foreseeable future, the FOMC has slowly but surely proceeded with moving from the dovish extreme of the policy spectrum into the opposite direction. That ought to put the Aussie under pressure as the currency’s perceived yield advantage against its US counterpart is eroded.

However, it is also critical to be mindful of the Australian dollar’s place on the risk-on side of the sentiment divide in the G10 FX space. This makes the currency highly vulnerable to sharp swings in risk appetite, warning of potentially treacherous terrain ahead as geopolitical headwinds gather. The crisis in the Ukraine takes top billing ahead of a referendum in Crimea set to be held this weekend. The poll will decide whether the semi-autonomous region will choose to be part of a nation headquartered in Kiev or Moscow.

The referendum’s outcome and subsequent maneuvers from world powers has scope to generate significant knee-jerk volatility in investors’ mood. An upsetting of the status quo is often the risk-off scenario in the markets’ treatment of geopolitics, suggesting a vote to secede from the Ukraine and be absorbed into Russia may carry negative implications for the Aussie. Such an outcome is somewhat high on investors’ probability scale however, so the surrounding theatrics (including Moscow’s moves to scramble together the legislative framework to allow Crimea to join the Federation) will be important in gauging market-moving potential.

Application may not work as expected.###3729||Empty###3730||After floating the idea that it might raise the fee for Prime shipping to $119 from the current $79, Amazon settled on a $20 increase, to $99 per year. In states where Amazon collects sales tax, the fee will be over $100 because Amazon charges sales tax on the service. The increase becomes effective for those signing up as new subscribers on March 20 and on April 17 for renewing subscribers. This is the first price increase since the service launched in 2005. The special student price increases from $39 to $49. Amazon announced the increase to it subscribers via email messages.

Why Did Amazon Increase the Fee?

Amazon could add $500 million to its bottom line if it does not lose too many customers. It needs this revenue because of its thin margins. Despite the fee increase, shipping will still be a net loss for the company. Brokerage service BGC analyst Colin Gillis wrote in a research note, ” The shipping losses the company incurs to help drive revenue remain a barrier to profitability…Shipping losses are growing at approximately 23% YoY [year over year], and the losses were approximately 2x the shipping revenue in the December quarter….Even if shipping revenue in the most recent quarter increased 40% to $1.59 billion, shipping losses would still be 47% greater than the losses.”

Most orders over $35 will continue to be eligible for free shipping for people who do not belong to the Prime program. However, Prime includes much more than just shipping. Since starting the subscription service, Amazon has added unlimited access to over 40,000 movies and TV episodes via Prime Instant Video. It also provides access to more than 500,000 books for borrowing from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. To placate customers who may consider leaving because of the fee hike, Amazon is likely to soon roll out a streaming music service similar to Apple’s iTunes Radio. And over the past few years, the company has hinted that it is working on a set-top television box to compete with Roku.

Wall Street Reaction

As the increase became public on the morning of May 13, the stock rose to its second highest value this year, $382. However, by day’s end the stock had fallen to $371. The analyst community is split on whether this is an increase that loyal Prime customers will be willing to absorb or if customers will leave the program in droves. One competitor jumped into the fray quickly. On the same day Amazon revealed the fee increase, online merchant ShopRunner announced its intention to lure Amazon Prime customers by offering a free one-year membership to its own $79 shipping service. (See “Amazon Prime, ShopRunner Forcing Faster Free Shipping,” our article last Fall, for more.)

Analysts state that Prime members spend twice as much as other Amazon shoppers, well over $1,200 a year. Those Amazon customers who are interested only in free shipping and not streaming entertainment or Kindle books may be more willing to leave the Prime service and take their chances with free shipping on orders over $35. While Amazon has never revealed how many Prime subscribers it has, analyst estimates put the number at 20 to 25 million.

Third Party Sellers

On the Amazon Sellers’ Forum, Amazon Marketplace sellers have discussed the potential price increase for months. Some believe that they will lose customers as a result of the increase as people abandon Prime. But others expect most customers to take the increase in stride. It turns out that sellers are enthusiastic customers on Amazon as well as sellers and one said, “I did the math on my hard good orders for 2013 the other day. I paid .13 per shipment via Prime for shipping. I wasn’t kidding when I said I buy almost everything on Amazon.”

It will be difficult to determine if Amazon loses Prime subscribers because the company does not report membership figures. The company is betting that those who are in the habit of buying frequently on Amazon may find it difficult to kick the habit.###3731||Empty###3732||Why did this happen?

The consumer price index rose 0.1% in February, matching January's increase, the Labor Department said Tuesday. In the past 12 months, prices have risen just 1.1%, down from 1.6% in January and the smallest yearly gain in five months.

Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.1% last month and 1.6% in the past year.

Energy prices fell 0.5% because lower gasoline and electricity costs offset higher prices for natural gas and heating oil. Clothes and used cars were also cheaper last month.

Still, consumers took a hit at the grocery store as food costs rose 0.4%, the most in nearly 2 ½ years. Beef prices jumped 4% in February, the most in more than 10 years, as recent droughts have pushed up cattle feed prices. Milk, cheese and other dairy prices also rose.

The big drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.1% comes as the Federal Reserve starts a two-day policy meeting, its first under new chair Janet Yellen. Low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve to pursue extraordinary stimulus programs in an effort to boost economic growth.

The Fed is now trying to unwind some of that stimulus. It is purchasing $65 billion in bonds this month, down from $75 billion in January and $85 billion last year. The bond purchases are aimed at lowering long-term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending.

Fed policymakers are expected to announce another $10 billion cut Wednesday.

The slowdown in the annual inflation rate occurred partly because energy prices spiked in February 2013, and that figure has now fallen out of the year-over-year calculation. As a result, economists don't think the rate will fall much further.

Inflation has been held back by sluggish growth and a tough job market, which makes it harder for retailers and other businesses to raise prices.

While shoppers may prefer lower prices, economists warn that super-low inflation can slow economic growth. It encourages consumers to postpone purchases and can also make inflation-adjusted interest rates higher, potentially discouraging borrowing.

link###3736||King Digital Entertainment, the Irish parent company of the mobile game Candy Crush Saga, has enjoyed massive and rapid growth thanks to its highly addictive digital offspring; in February alone, Candy Crush garnered 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game-plays. According to an amended SEC filing released Wednesday, King wants those billions of games played to translate to billions of dollars in its upcoming initial public offering -- as much as $7.6 billion, in fact. But with a litter of once-hot (but now, not) apps in its wake -- see: Farmville, Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds, to name three -- the biggest question that remains is not if King Digital can reach its $7.6 billion target, but whether it can avoid the fate of Zynga, the mobile gaming company whose Farmville is among those apps that have faded from public memory and whose shares have fallen more than 40% since its IPO in 2011.

In an amended prospectus filed Wednesday morning, King revealed that it has applied to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "KING" at an expected price range of $21 to $24 per share. In the meantime, it is selling 22.2 million shares in its initial offering, a sale that would result in $532.8 million in raised funds if the shares are sold at the top of that price range. King expects to net a little less than the top end of the range, saying it expects to receive $326 million in net proceeds based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.50 per ordinary share.

The offering of the 22.2 million shares leaves a little under 315 million shares outstanding, which if sold at $24 per share would give King its desired $7.6 billion valuation.

However, King's largest individual shareholders will need some market help if they want their own stakes to win them entry into the ten figure club. King chairman Melvyn Morris owns 35.6 million shares, an 11.3% stake that would be worth more than $854 million at the high end of the filed price range, while chief executive Riccardo Zacconi's 30 million-share stake, 9.6%, would be worth a little over $728 million. (Note that these share-ownership figures differ from King's original prospectus, filed in February, but the day after the original prospectus was filed King issued an automatic share conversion to convert the many different classes of its shares all into Class A stock, hence increasing shareholders' share counts.)

King's single largest shareholder, private equity firm Apax Ventures, will own a stake worth $3.83 billion if outstanding shares go for $24 a pop. The firm currently owns a 48% stake in the company but is accounting for 6.6 million of the 22.2 million shares up for grabs in the initial offering; even after the 6.6 million shares are sold, though, Apax will remain King's largest shareholder with a stake worth 44.8%.

In the SEC filing, CEO Zacconi lauded the health of his business, saying, "We have a substantial cash position and no debt, and we have been cash flow positive since 2005. Going public creates a liquid market for our current and future employees and equity holders and will give us greater flexibility to act on strategic opportunities if they arise in the future."

Nonetheless, risks abound -- especially for a company whose success hinges on the viral appeal of its mobile games. Many a comparison has been made to Zynga, the company behind the once-viral Farmville, a game that has largely faded from public memory. Zynga IPO'ed in 2011 with a $7 billion valuation, or $10 per share. The stock hit its peak -- $14.69 per share -- in February 2012, but has remained on a downward path ever since. Zynga currently trades around $5.80 a share, a more-than 40% decline from its stock market debut. Ironically, it was King's Candy Crush that ousted Farmville as the most-played app on Facebook.

In its amended filing Wednesday, King acknowledged the risks, noting, "we have experienced significant rapid growth in our operations; a small number of games currently generate a substantial majority of our revenue; we face significant competition; if players do not find our casual game formats compelling and engaging, we could lose players and our revenue could decline; we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict."###3737||Why did this happen?

The SEALs boarded the tanker Morning Glory late Sunday in international waters southeast of Cyprus. Rear Adm. John Kirby says no one was injured in the operation, which was approved by President Barack Obama.

The vessel, whose ownership remains a mystery, was carrying stolen Libyan crude oil from the port of Al-Sidra. Libyan officials had ordered the tanker confiscated, but it managed to escape.

The Pentagon says the Morning Glory will return to Libya under the control of sailors from the USS Stout.

The Morning Glory previously sailed under a North Korean flag, but North Korea says it has nothing to do with the ship.###3741||Empty###3742||Empty###3743||MILAN (AP) -- European car sales grew for a sixth consecutive month in February but remained at a low level as the market recovered slowly from the financial crisis.

The European carmaker's association said Tuesday that sales of new passenger cars in the EU grew 8 percent last month to 861,058 units.

While the result is further evidence that the European market is coming out of its longest contraction ever, analysts warn price discounting remains strong.

Carlos Da Silva of IHS Automotive notes that the positive cycle compares with "dreadful" lows recorded in six years of contraction and "the overall situation remains more tense that it might appear." February's sales were at the second-lowest level ever for the month.

Among major markets, only France saw sales contract, by 1.4 percent.###3744||Empty###3745||

In February, the winter Olympic Games brought athletes from around the world together in Russia, but in Ukraine, Russia’s neighbor to the southwest, the story has been one of division. Violent clashes between pro-EU (European Union) protesters and government forces in the past few months have focused the eyes of the world on the former-Soviet state after (now former) President Yanukovych had refused to sign an Association Pact forging closer ties to the EU and decided instead to accept funding from Russia.

These incidents are extremely tragic, and we sympathize with the people there during this time of chaos. We are watching developments closely as they unfold, including the most recent tensions in the Crimean peninsula. While it’s impossible to determine how the situation will play out, as an investor, I believe Ukraine’s strategic importance to both Russia and the EU could help ensure its survival, its solvency—and its potential long-term success.

Ukraine today is clearly at a crossroads, and its market has been volatile. We expect ongoing noise and political tensions will continue there for a while. Central power in Ukraine is in disarray while, in many regions, local governors have either resigned or have effectively stopped managing their territories due to uncertainty in the capital city of Kiev. Ukraine’s parliament (Rada) has wasted no time proposing new legislative reforms, including one to limit presidential powers. Speaker Alexander Turchinov is serving as acting president until elections are held in late May.

While the opposition has taken control, the country is fairly divided between east and west and between views of whether it should move closer to the EU or closer to Russia. That divided view among the Ukrainians is expressed in the political rhetoric and, unfortunately for the people there, I don’t think there’s going to be a quick solution. You can see the political dividing lines in Ukraine drawn in its electoral map; the parts of the country oriented farther westward, toward Europe, have been the areas where the most fervent protests have taken place. Closer to the Russian border on the east, you’ll find more Russian-speaking Ukrainians, and more support for the more pro-Russian policies of former President Yanukovych.

As long-term investors, my team and I continue to be interested in Ukrainian equities where we see opportunities on an individual company level. Looking past the headlines, it’s important to remember that Ukraine offers Russia access to its only naval seaport on the Black Sea, it has gas pipeline access to Europe, and it is considered Europe’s breadbasket. Ukraine is geopolitically one of the most important countries in Eurasia, and, assuming the country doesn’t break apart, I think it will need to use diplomatic skills to maintain friendly relations with Russia while also opening to the West. Another Soviet-bloc country and neighbor to Russia, Georgia, represents an example in this regard. Russia still holds influence there, but Georgia is forging its own path, as I wrote about in a post in December.

While global escalation of the current conflict remains a possibility in Ukraine, we think this is unlikely as it is in the interest of all parties to have a unified and stable Ukraine. There are four sources from which financial support for Ukraine could come: the EU, the US, Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Amid an escalation of conflict, Russia has suspended its financial aid package, which had been keeping Ukraine solvent. The EU might come through with some aid, but it will probably not be close to what Ukraine needs. Also, European aid could come with considerable delays due to procedures in the EU.

The United States could also offer aid, but probably not the entire US$15 billion-plus sought by the Ukrainians. It seems to me that the IMF would be the only realistic option. We cannot rule out a possibility that the IMF could soften its conditions for release of a new tranche of aid now, particularly when (as we suspect) the EU and the United States have asked, or will ask, it to. This option could also suit Russia. Ukraine has to repay about US$8 billion on its debt this year, and the next large payment is scheduled for June. The Rada’s decision to call new presidential elections on May 25 could also have been influenced by this timeline.

The situation in Ukraine remains confused, but it seems that Russia on the one side and the U.S. and the EU on the other, do not want a military confrontation. As we see it, Russia certainly does not want an unstable government in Ukraine and the EU certainly does not want it in view of the enormous amounts of gas that are pumped to Europe from Russia to Ukraine. For these reasons, it is no surprise that Russia has moved back from an armed conflict by having the Russian troops on the eastern Ukraine border retreat back to base.

President Putin also held out the possibility of recognizing the winner of the May presidential elections as well as participating in a multilateral program for the country. Factors tempering Russia’s behavior in Ukraine have been the big decline in the ruble and the Russian stock market since the conflict began to escalate, a confirmation that Russia is subject to international pressures. Russia needs to attract foreign capital and the Ukraine situation will likely impact flows, so their actions will likely need to be measured, in our view. The important point is that Russia now has de facto control of Crimea and has stated that it would intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine if asked by the local Russian-speaking population.

Overall, because of the intense interest from Russia and the West, we think Ukraine will not likely be short of finances from either or both sides, if the new leadership is able to act wisely and diplomatically.

We will be watching developments in Ukraine closely, and are hopeful for a peaceful resolution. We are also hopeful that we’ll see a quite different Ukraine story in a few years—and that it will be a much more positive one.

Friday’s non-farm payrolls report showed an increase of 175,000 jobs in February versus an expected 152,000. But the unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6% in January.

The Nasdaq was weak as a second day of profit-taking in the biotech sector coupled with weakness late in the day in other technology stocks kept a lid on a possible recovery. The S&P 500 held onto its gains thanks to strength in the financial sector, which posted a 3% gain for the week.

At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31 points to 16,453, the S&P 500 rose 1 point to 1,878, and the Nasdaq fell 16 points to 4,336. The NYSE’s primary market traded 723 million shares with total volume of 3.6 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.1 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners outpaced advancers by 1.3-to-1, while on the Nasdaq, there were only slightly more decliners than advancers.

For the week, the Dow rose 0.8%, the S&P 500 gained 1%, the Nasdaq was up 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.7%.

The Nasdaq broke to a new 13-year closing high on Thursday but gave back the gains on Friday. The index is slowing its advance slightly, and that is showing in MACD and other momentum indicators. Immediate support rests at the 20-day moving average, and a fall to that level would close the gap opened earlier in the week.



Click to Enlarge

The Russell 2000 broke to new intraday and closing highs last week. The breakout was from a very bullish “V” formation that bottomed precisely at its intermediate trendline early in February. Both MACD and momentum are strong, but a small horn formation has developed, which could slow the advance until that is resolved.

Conclusion: Despite economic and political uncertainties, stocks continue to make new highs. The advance is characteristic of a bull market that has considerable strength behind it. Institutional interest is demonstrated by higher-than-average block trading, while average investors’ bearishness increased by over 5% last week, according to AAII’s sentiment survey.

I focused on the small- and mid-cap stocks for this report, but the broad-based S&P 500 scored four consecutive new intraday highs last week. The highs were accompanied by higher volume, and group rotation was very active.

Everything points to higher prices, but that doesn’t mean that daily adjustments won’t occur. When they do, we should use them to take new positions in high-quality, oversold stocks. Patience is the key to success, and chasing stocks that are making new highs is a high-risk proposition in a stock market that is celebrating its fifth year as a bull.

Ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made their appeal Friday in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. A similar letter was expected to be sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.

The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports, noting that the "presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe."

The ambassadors warn that the unrest in Ukraine has brought back Cold War memories and that energy security threatens the region's residents on a daily basis.

"Gas-to-gas competition in our region is a vital aspect of national security and a key U.S. interest in the region," the ambassadors wrote in a letter.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes between Ukraine and Russia have led to gas supply cuts. Russian state gas company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government, which now owes $1.89 billion for Russian natural gas, by warning that if Ukraine doesn't pay off its debt, there could be a repeat of 2009, when Russia cut off supplies to Europe because of a pricing dispute with Ukraine.

Recent advancements have made it possible for gas that normally flows through Ukraine to the European Union to instead flow the other direction so that nations such as Poland and Hungary can supply gas to Ukraine if Russia were to cut off its supply. But with gas supplies limited, the region is still vulnerable unless the United States makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.

Boehner and Republicans have been urging the Obama administration to clear the way for more exports amid a natural gas boom in the United States. The Department of Energy has only approved six export licenses in recent years out of about two dozen pending.

In a statement Saturday, Boehner called on Obama to "heed this call from our allies" and "do everything possible to use American energy to reduce the dependency on Russia for our friends in Europe and around the globe."

"I hope President Obama will heed this call from our allies to use his 'pen and phone' to direct the secretary of energy to immediately approve pending natural gas export requests and do everything possible to use American energy to reduce the dependency on Russia for our friends in Europe and around the globe."

The White House has argued that Russia's dependence on gas revenue makes it unlikely that the country will cut off supplies to Europe despite the ongoing crisis in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, where the Russian military has intervened in what the United States regards as a violation of international law.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that because Europe has had a relatively mild winter, gas supplies are at or above normal levels. He said even if the United States did approve more export licenses, it would take until the end of 2015 for gas to be delivered. "Proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect," Earnest said.###3749||The Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has warned that there is a "distinct possibility" that the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move its headquarters outside of Scotland if a referendum in September goes in favour of independence.

Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney will meet with the Treasury Select Committee to answer questions on the "economics of currency unions" amid debate over the possible implications of a Scottish vote for independence.

Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK.

First Minister Alex Salmond's Scottish Government wants to create a "sterling zone" with the rest of the UK if there is a Yes vote in the break-away referendum.

Mr Carney said in a speech in January that an effective currency union would force a newly-independent Scotland to hand over some national sovereignty in a similar way to how this is done in the eurozone.###3750||Colorado made roughly 2 million dollars (£1.2 million) in taxes on marijuana in January, state revenue officials reported in the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.

Revenue was up 8%, which topped expectations of analysts.

In Tuesday’s premarket trading the stock was up.

The company, which sells sporting goods and runs Golf Galaxy and its stores of the same name, earned over $138.6 million or a per share amount of $1.11, for the three month period ending February 1. That was up from $129.6 million or a per share amount of $1.03 for the same period one year ago.

The earnings were equal to Wall Street expectations. Revenue was up 8% to end the quarter at $1.95 billion from the same period one year ago of $1.81 billion. The revenue figures out did Wall Street expectations of $1.94 billion.

Dick’s share prices were up 67 or about 1.2% to just over $55 in early morning trading before the opening bell.

Sales at stores opened 13 months or more, an important gauge of the health of a retailer, were up by 7.3% when adjusted for last year’s extra week during the holiday shopping season. This metric excludes all results from stores that either have been opened or closes recently.

For the full year, Dick’s earned $337 million or a per share rate of $2.69 which was up from the previous year of $290.6 million or a per share rate of $2.31. Revenue was up by 6% to end the year at $6.21 billion compared to the $5.84 billion from last year. The increase was due to growth in same-stores and openings of new stores.

Sales at locations opened 13 months or more were up by 1.9%. Dick’s kept its 2014 earnings forecast in a range of between $3.30 and $3.08 a share. Analysts predict it will be $3.10 a share.

For its 2014 first quarter, the sporting goods chain is anticipating earnings of 51 cent to 53 cents a share. Wall Street is expecting the company to have earnings of 54 cents a share for that period.

Dick’s as of the end of the quarter had 558 stores in 46 states and 79 Golf Galaxy stores across 29 states.###3752||Empty###3753||Asian CEOs are mostly declining to take a stand on whether they will speak at an investment conference that has become contentious after the suspected death of Saudi journalist, a contrast with U.S. and European counterparts.###3754||* Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac shares fall on Senate proposal for wind-down

By Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq up for the first session in five, as investors grappled with the evolving situation in Ukraine but shrugged off concern over weakness in China’s economy.

The EU agreed a framework for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many had expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the effort to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

London copper prices, a proxy for economic health due to the metal’s broad industrial use, hit their lowest since July 2010 on concerns about credit problems in China, but later rebounded. Copper has fallen 7.7 percent over four sessions. Spot gold hit a six-month high on its safe-haven appeal.

“The situation in Ukraine and a slowing China are going to matter, but they haven’t mattered yet. Commodity prices are falling and that is tied to demand,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

However, money is on the sidelines. Investors, worried about missing another leg up in the five-year U.S. equity bull market, are keeping indexes near recent highs.

“People think they missed out and the market is going to do the same it did last year,” she said. “There’s more retail money flowing into the system, supporting stocks.”

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.17 points or 0.07 percent, to 16,340.08, the S&P 500 gained 0.57 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,868.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.144 points or 0.37 percent, to 4,323.332.

Geopolitical developments have moved to the forefront this week on a lack of major corporate results and market-moving economic data. The S&P 500 rose 30 percent last year and, after a recent decline, hit a record high last Friday.

“We’ve climbed so far, to continue to climb is definitely going to be a see-saw move,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Herbalife fell 7.4 percent to $60.57 after the company said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations. Shares briefly fell as much as 16 percent.

Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell sharply, a day after leaders of the Senate Banking Committee announced an agreement on legislation to wind down the government-owned mortgage financiers. Fannie lost 12.2 percent to $3.54 and Freddie fell 16.8 percent to $3.36.

EPL Oil & Gas Inc jumped 28.8 percent to $37.50 after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion including debt. Energy XXI shares lost 7.8 percent to $21.54.

Express Inc dropped 12 percent to $16.05 after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations.

Oxigene Inc surged 77.3 percent to $4.29. The company said its experimental drug Zybrestat, combined with Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a mid-stage clinical trial.

Geron Corp plunged 61.6 percent to $1.69. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a halt to trials of a cancer drug over concerns about potential liver damage.

About 6.4 billion shares traded in U.S. exchanges, according to the latest available data from BATS Global Markets, below the 6.9 billion daily average so far this month.

Advancers outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 5 on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq 9 issues rose for every 7 that fell.###3755||Empty###3756||Empty###3757||Why did this happen?

Bank governor Mark Carney faced more than 41/2 hours of questioning by lawmakers yesterday, a large part of which was devoted to the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.

"This is as serious as Libor [London interbank offered rate] if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told them.

A new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, would be created as part of the shake-up, which would be spelled out in detail next Tuesday, he said.

"One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence," Carney said.

The Bank of England said in October, shortly after Carney took over as governor, that it had hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the bank's expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.

The bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of oversight of commercial banks.

The case for change at the bank has grown stronger since allegations that staff might not have acted on signs of possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates.

Carney told the lawmakers that the Bank of England's top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.

The bank suspended an official last week amid an internal review into whether staff had failed to flag up signs that foreign exchange traders exchanged client orders to manipulate daily benchmark rates, dating as far back as 2006.

Carney, facing questions from lawmakers about the case, said he and other top officials at the bank first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year and he told the bank's governing board on the same day.

"We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation," he said.

Carney said the bank would need to consider changing its policies and how to bring about a change of culture. The new strategic plan would include measures to "reinforce the positive cultural changes that have happened in the institution", he said.

Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously the Bank of England's head of foreign exchange, said he only learned of the allegations of manipulation last year.

In his previous role, Fisher chaired the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee, a forum for Bank of England officials and market players to discuss market issues.

It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with Bank of England officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings.###3761||Empty###3762||Empty###3763||March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker late on Sunday that had was seized earlier this month at a Libyan port by three armed men, the U.S. Department of Defense said.

Monday said it has agreed to acquire 100 percent of the share capital of Spanish cable operator Grupo Corporativo Ono, S.A. for a total consideration of 7.2 billion euros or $10 billion on a debt and cash free basis.

Vodafone expects the deal to complete in the third calendar quarter of 2014. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow per share from the first full year after completion, after cost and capex synergies and before integration costs.

The deal values Ono at a multiple of 7.5 times 2013 Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization or EBITDA and 10.4 times 2013 operating free cash flow adjusted for cost and capex synergies. The transaction ''comfortably meets'' Vodafone's M&A criteria, the telecom giant added.

The deal is Vodafone's first major acquisition since the recent sale of its 45 percent sake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ).

Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao said, ''Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction - together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme - will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.''

Ono has the largest next-generation network or NGN in Spain, with around 7.2 million homes released to marketing in 13 of Spain's 17 regions. It reaches more than 300 municipalities, including the nine largest cities. Ono offers fixed and mobile communications and television services to about 1.9 million customers.

For full year, 2013, Ono reported revenue of 1.598 billion euros and loss before tax of 41 million euros. EBITDA, adjusted to remove a 6 million euros PPA non-cash item, was 680 million euros.

According to Vodafone, the deal expands its unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market. It provides a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach complementary to Vodafone Spain's ongoing fibre-to-the-home or FTTH build program.

Vodafone expects to achieve cost and capex synergies with a run-rate of about 240 million euros before integration costs by the fourth full year post completion. This is equivalent to a net present value of about 2 billion euros after integration costs.

Vodafone sees a significant opportunity to enhance growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company's customer base. The company estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of around 1.0 billion euros.

Vodafone plans to work closely with Ono's management team and employees to support the integration. The company expects Ono's management to become an integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined .

Ono's employees will also benefit from a broader range of international career opportunities available across the Vodafone Group, the firm noted.

Vodafone will finance the transaction from its existing cash resources and committed, undrawn bank facilities.

Business News###3765||An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

The San Jose Mercury News reported Saturday that Guinness Book of World Record officials say the $201-million life insurance policy is more than double the previous record set in 1990 by an unidentified "entertainment industry figure."

A Southern California financial services company who helped put the deal together declined to identify the buyer for safety reasons.

"We don't want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate," quipped Dovi Frances of the Santa Barbara-based SG LLC financial services company.

Frances said that the life insurance policy is actually two dozen policies underwritten by 19 different insurers. That's because no one company could afford to pay the policies' beneficiaries when the billionaire died.

Frances didn't disclose the annual cost to the billionaire for the policy, but did say it was in the single millions of dollars. He said Guinness officials spent six months investigating the policy before declaring it the world record.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder.

A spokeswoman for billionaire Elon Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors and other high-flying start-ups, declined to say whether he was the mystery buyer.

Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age. Frances said the billionaire purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax.###3766||Starbucks says that 1-in-10 customers now uses the company’s mobile payment app when buying their lattes and whatnot at the coffee colossus, but these customers must currently dig into their pockets if they want to show their appreciation with a tip for the barista. But starting next week, iPhone users will have the option of leaving digital tops at the ‘bucks.

The AP reports that the iPhone update coming on March 19 will allow Starbucks customers to add tips of $.50, $1 or $2 after they place their order. Unlike online-ordering services like GrubHub or Delivery.com, where you’re adding in the tip at the time of making the purchase, the Starbucks app will give customers a two-hour window to decide if the service was worth the extra money.

Most restaurant servers earn hourly wages below the minimum wage and rely on tips to survive, but Starbucks baristas are paid above that minimum wage line and any tips left by customers help to supplement their income. This is one of the reasons that not all customers leave a tip, or only leave one when they receive extraordinary service.

Not all Starbucks locations will be included in the tipping option, only the 64% of stores that are company-owned will take part in the program initially. That leaves out most of those Starbucks stores you find in places like airports, retail stores, and inside the lobbies of office buildings; those locations are generally franchised.

Starbucks says the tipping option was requested by app users, who wanted the ability to leave a gratuity after making their purchase. The company says that though the tips from the app would be made electronically, employees will still be paid their share of the tips in cash the same way they get tip money now.

One employee at Starbucks tells the AP that the tipping option could help increase the amount of tips received by baristas, but cautions that employers shouldn’t rely on tips to make up for low wages, saying, “It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them.”###3767||Correction: Virtu had posted one day of losses during the last five years, not the last four years, as an earlier version of this story stated.

It pays to be a high-frequency trading firm.

Virtu Financial Inc. filed preliminary papers to go public on Monday and revealed that it only had one day of trading losses in five years.

The market maker states in its SEC filing that one net trading loss occurred between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2013:

“As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”

Industry watchers say that this statistic is “incredible” and really speaks to the sophisticated and rigorous technology behind the high-frequency trading algorithms that Virtu is using.

“They have a smart approach and algorithms to try to minimize risk,” said Igor Gonta, who spent 13 years on Wall Street in commodities sales and trading and now runs Market Prophit, a big data analytics firm involved in social media and stock sentiment.

The technology behind the high-frequency trading algorithms is only as good as the philosophical framework that goes into designing what the technology looks like, notes Gonta.

In the filing, Virtu said it had 2013 revenue of approximately $665 million, up 8% from the year before, and net income of $182 million, more than double from the year before. The high-frequency trader is seeking a valuation of approximately $3 billion for its initial public offering, which is about twice that of its closest rival KCG Holdings Inc.

Bloomberg

Technology is very complex for these high-speed trading firms and providing liquidity and protecting shareholders is critical, as a small glitch can cost millions, experts say.

In 2012, Virtu tried to buy Knight Capital, another electronic market maker but was edged out by Getco LLC. Knight Capital became a target for a takeover after it experienced a technology glitch which resulted in losses for the firm of more than $400 million.

“This is the uber version of a brokerage firm,” said Gonta. “Virtu does it in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the technology.”

Approximately 25,250 vehicles are affected by the recall.

The recall will help improve pedal feel during "certain aggressive braking maneuvers," Chrysler said in a statement on its website.

"A supplier raised with the company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop," Chrysler said in a statement.

Chrysler said it does not know of any related injuries or accidents.

Of the affected vehicles, approximately 18,700 are in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico and 5,200 outside the NAFTA region, according to the automaker.

A specific recall date has not been announced yet.

"Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations," said Chrysler. "An investigation discovered brake-fluid flow was being restricted too much. A software update optimizes flow and restores appropriate pedal feel."

Chrysler dealers are being instructed to update the software in the affected vehicles, free of charge.

Owners with more questions can contact Chrysler at 1-800-853-1403.###3769||Global growth is likely to remain sluggish as a slowdown in the developing world undercuts gains in Europe and the United States, a leading international economic body warned Tuesday.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said one-off factors like the harsh winter weather in North America and the U.S. government shutdown mean "growth for the major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be somewhat slower than in the second half of 2013."The underlying trend for those economies, however, continues to be of strengthening growth, said the OECD, a think tank for the world's most developed countries, in an update to forecasts made in November.Meanwhile, emerging economies, which now account for over half the world economy, "are experiencing a marked loss of momentum," the OECD said. If that continues, the OECD warned it "is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term."In its World Economic Outlook, the organization forecasts global growth of 3.6 percent this year, from an estimated 2.7 percent in 2013. It says the recovery in the United States "is relatively well established," contrary to what it sees happening in the EU and Japan, where the OECD called for further monetary stimulus.The OECD warned that while activity in the EU seems to be improving, "so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than in the other major economies."It also warned that the dip in growth in the U.S. over the winter could have longer-lasting repercussion. "If the recent economic weakness were to durably depress confidence, it could undermine the recovery," the OECD said.###3770||Empty###3771||Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million (£2.1 million) in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized marijuana in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sale for recreational use. It levies a 15 per cent excise tax and a 2.9 per cent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year - even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which shops are licensed and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

Oil officials said earlier navy forces had seized the North Korea-flagged tanker outside the rebel-held Es Sider port to escort it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.

Giving the first details of the operation, Prime Minister Zeidan said the tanker was not yet in western Libya. "The ship is around 20 miles from Es Sider," he said in an interview.

"It stopped due to darkness and won't move tonight but is under complete control and secured. Tomorrow it will move."

Authorities would unload the crude from the tanker once it reached a western port and then launch legal measures against the potential buyers.

Zeidan also said Libya would end the blockade of all rebel ports in the east either through talks or by military force.

"What is confirmed it that all ports will be liberated from the occupiers with all means possible," he said. "We prefer talks but if talks fail then the state will act," he said.

The Governor of the Bank of England told MPs that ensuring the probity of foreign exchange rates is “incredibly important” for the $3 trillion (£1.8 trillion) currency market, 40pc of which is traded in London. He added that investigating the allegations was “fundamentally important” for the Bank of England itself.

Mr Carney revealed that the Bank is about to appoint a new Deputy Governor responsible for markets and banking. The first task of the new director, to be revealed next week, will be to “conduct a root-and-branch review of how [the Bank] conducts market intelligence”, Mr Carney said. It will be the fourth deputy governor - a record for the Bank, which managed with just one between 1694 and 1998.

Paul Fisher, director of markets at the Bank, categorically denied claims that the Old Lady was warned about foreign exchange rate fixing in 2006 - but agreed he could “see why people might think that from the minutes”.

Last week minutes released from a Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (JSC) meeting in 2006 showed that the Bank was told about “evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix”.

Mr Fisher, a former chairman of the JSC, explained that minutes referred to dealers concerns about hedge funds moving the rates by placing big trades in the markets. The fears were not over collusion between rate setters. Even so, last week the Bank suspended an official amid an internal review into whether staff failed to flag up warnings about manipulation into the foreign exchange market.

Mr Carney said the suspension was “not a disciplinary” move but one that showed that the Bank was taking the allegations seriously. He said he and the Bank first became aware of the allegations on October 16 last year. He told the Court of Directors the same day and appointed external lawyers to investigate “within 48 hours” because even “the fact of the allegations” was serious, he said.

Andrea Leadsom MP criticised the Bank for not probing the claims years ago, or at least after the Libor scandal.###3785||Empty###3786||(Updates levels. For previous report, double-click )

SINGAPORE, March 11 (Reuters) - Emerging Asian currencies edged higher versus the dollar on Tuesday with sentiment improving as the Chinese yuan stabilised and regional equities held firm.

The Indian rupee hit a fresh seven-month high against the dollar at 60.5925. Traders said moves in local equities were being watched for cues on foreign fund inflows.

The South Korean won edged higher, helped by South Korean exporters’ dollar selling for settlements.

Asian currencies were broadly firmer, although the Indonesian rupiah was little changed, lagging slightly behind other regional units. One rupiah trader said foreign banks were spotted selling the dollar versus the rupiah on behalf of their clients.

Asian currencies drew support from “slightly brighter equities” and the Chinese yuan’s mid-point fixing, said a trader for a Malaysian bank in Kuala Lumpur.

The yuan’s mid-point was set at 6.1327 versus the dollar on Tuesday.

The yuan’s mid-point was fixed at a lower level than was set on Monday. But the one-day change was smaller than Monday’s, when the Chinese currency’s mid-point was fixed at a much weaker level than on Friday.

The yuan stood at 6.1400 versus the dollar, little changed on the day.

Emerging Asian currencies closely track the Chinese yuan because of the region’s dependence on China’s economy.

———————————————————————— (Additional reporting by Jungmin Jang in SEOUL; Editing by Chris Gallagher)###3787||NEW YORK — McDonald's is fighting to hold onto customers in the U.S. — and all that snow didn't help.

The world's biggest hamburger chain said Monday that sales fell 1.4 percent at established U.S. locations. It blamed the harsh winter weather, but conceded that "challenging industry dynamics" also played a role.

After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald's has been struggling to boost sales as people increasingly flock to places like Chipotle and Five Guys Burgers and Fries. Those chains have popped up quickly across the country by positioning themselves as a step up from traditional fast food, for a little extra money. They also offer greater customization, meaning diners can dictate exactly what toppings they want.

Executives at McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., acknowledge Americans' changing eating habits.

"A long time ago, mass appeal had to be mass appeal," Jeff Stratton, the president of McDonald's USA said in an interview with The Associated Press last month. "That's not necessarily the case anymore today."

The restaurants are adapting to a world where McDonald's traditional strength — consistency — isn't always enough.

For example, McDonald's is rolling out new prep tables that can hold more toppings and sauces, a sign that it plans to give customers greater variety.

In Southern California, the company is even testing a "build-your-own-burger" concept that lets people use tablets to tap out the bread, cheese and other toppings they want on their burgers. Executives say results are promising so far, but rolling out the offering across its more than 14,000 U.S. locations would require considerable changes to kitchens.

In the meantime, McDonald's has made other changes to its menu, including the option to get egg whites in breakfast sandwiches, and the rollout of chicken McWraps, which are intended to appeal to people who want fresher, healthier food.

Globally, McDonald's said sales declined 0.3 percent at locations open at least 13 months in February. It warned that its muted performance so far this year could hurt first-quarter profit margins.

In region encompassing the Middle East, Africa and Asia, sales declined 2.6 percent. The company cited weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as a shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.

Europe was a relative bright spot, with sales up 0.6 percent on a strong performance in the U.K. and growth in France.

McDonald's has more than 35,000 locations in more than 100 countries.

Its stock shed 31 cents to $95.19 in morning trading.

Most regional shares edged higher, led by Japan's Nikkei which advanced 0.8 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday.

Shanghai, however, lost another 0.2 percent to be perilously close to it lowest since last July and prices for industrial commodities stayed under water in the wake of February's shock fall in Chinese exports.

Dealers were especially nervous about iron ore following an 8 percent slide on Monday that fuelled unease about the health of China's giant steel sector.

Brent crude lost a further 13 cents to $107.95, while U.S. oil extended its decline to $101.03 a barrel.

There was some relief that rates in Chinese money markets were not showing much strain while the yuan was fixed in line with expectations.

Wall Street also managed to end steady on Monday after recouping early losses. The Dow Jones industrial average ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P 500 lost just 0.05 percent.

Other popular indicators of risk were also muted. The stock market's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended little changed after an early spike, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent.

Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the U.S. dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies.

Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, stabilised at $0.9030 after losing half a U.S. cent on Monday.

The euro held rock steady at $1.3875, while the dollar inched up to 103.33 yen.

Later on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is expected to reaffirm its commitment to massive monetary stimulus. Nothing new is expected at the policy meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April.

The Japanese economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent annualised pace in the last quarter of 2013 as net exports proved a major drag, intensifying pressure for fresh action form the central bank.

The BOJ's decision is due anytime after 0300 GMT, and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference afterward.

And that is all the women seem to be upping and leaving to...###3792||They say crime pays? Not exactly. Legalize a former crime and tax it and it really pays.

Just ask Colorado. Perhaps not so awkwardly labeled the "Highest State," Colorado pulled in $2 million in taxes related to the sale of recreational marijuana...in January 2014 alone. Combined with taxes on sales from medicinal marijuana, the state pulled in nearly $3.5 million in pot-related tax revenue. If that trend continues, the state will see more than $40 million in additional tax dollars in 2014. To put that in perspective, that's approximately 1% of the total annual budgets for Delaware, South Dakota, Montana or West Virginia.

There are a couple of layers of tax in place on the sale of marijuana. To begin with, there's a 10% state sales tax imposed on retail marijuana and marijuana products on top of 2.9% in existing state sales tax (this is in addition to any local sales tax). As with other taxable products in Colorado, the tax is on the final consumer and cannot be included in the advertised price. Together with local sales taxes and special taxes, the tax imposed on consumers in Denver on the purchase of marijuana can reach as high as 21.12% (downloads as a pdf). Denver County accounted for more than half of all medicinal and recreational marijuana related sales tax revenue, while outside of the capital, taxes can be closer to 13%. No matter the level of tax, sales were pretty healthy statewide, with $14.02 million worth of recreational pot sold.

In addition to sales taxes, Colorado also imposes a "retail marijuana excise tax" of 15%. That tax is assessed on the first sale or transfer of marijuana from a retail marijuana cultivation facility and is calculated by taking the average market rate per pound and multiplying it by the weight of the flower times the tax rate. That means it's not directly charged to the consumer. The state is serious about that last piece: while the tax can certainly be rolled into the overall price as the cost of doing business, it may not be separately stated on a receipt to give the appearance that it's a consumer tax.

Additional licenses and fees are also imposed with those for medical marijuana outpacing those for retail marijuana by a factor of about five to one. The sale of medical marijuana has been legal and regulated in the state since 2000. The sale of recreational marijuana was made legal this year so these numbers for taxes, licenses and fees, are the first look at how those sales are directly impacting the economy.

The result? Despite taxes, no one is complaining - especially not the Department of Revenue. Even at relatively high rates, consumers are still buying and state officials have indicated that those numbers are on target.

The biggest problem is actually how to spend the money: it's not exactly a terrible problem to have. Voters approved a law last year that requires the first $40 million collected from the special excise taxes to be directed towards school construction. But after that? The state hasn't yet decided to do with the money. Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) has proposed using a significant chunk of the revenue on programs related to marijuana legalization including those to keep youths away from drugs, substance abuse treatment, and my favorite, the "anti-stoned-driving campaign." Here's my guess about the programming: it won't be particularly popular, at least not for long, and it won't be inked as such in the final bill.

Here's the reality: forget marijuana, it's the tax dollars that are addictive. The more lawmakers have, the more that they spend. And then they want even more. I can't imagine a scenario in which lawmakers would agree to simply direct millions and millions of tax dollars into more programming, well-intentioned or not. Expect a battle in Colorado over exactly how to spend that money.

As for the rest of the nation? They've got their perhaps slightly bloodshot - and envious - eyes on Colorado. For years, the sale of marijuana has been illegal - and taxing it wasn't even seriously considered for fear that it might somehow legitimize the use. Now, twenty states plus the District of Columbia allow people to use medical marijuana and two states (Colorado and Washington) allow sales for recreational use. Nationwide, it appears that public opinion is changing: a current petition to make marijuana legal has garnered nearly 100,000 signatures. Legalizing it would mean significant changes in the way we view crimes and the use of drugs across the country: taxing it would merely sweeten the pot.

Beyond knowing that your Mum was right and that sadly it doesn’t grow on trees, most of us have only a hazy idea of where money really comes from in the modern economy.



It’s one of those tail-chasing questions that can make your head hurt if you think about it too much - OK you get paid at the end of the month, but where did that money ultimately come from? How much money is there out there? And who controls the supply?



Back in the days of the Gold Standard and mainly cash transactions, it was relatively simple. You had as much money as you had gold in the vault. But in these days of electronic transfer, Fiat money, ultra-low interest rates and mind-bogglingly large government interventions aimed at boosting the money supply, things are a great deal more complicated.



Surely it’s the Bank of England’s job? Well yes, up to a point Lord Copper. Alarmed perhaps by the suggestion that it has more control over money supply than it actually does, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has issued a magisterial document explaining not only where money comes from but also exactly how QE is supposed to work. And precisely what the - rather limited - economic control levers the Bank can actually pull on are.



It’s 14 - rather nourishing - pages but probably the best explanation of 21st Century monetarism MT has read. Our only criticism is that it’s about five years late, but never mind.



For those who can’t be bothered (sorry, don’t have the time) to tackle the whole thing, here are three top facts to help you feel smug:



Money is created every time a bank makes a loan to a customer. This debunks the classical view that banks only lend money that is already in circulation.



QE is not supposed to be about giving more money to banks. Rather it’s institutional investors like pension funds who are supposed to benefit first, then the rest of us by trickle down. (MT wonders if this isn’t partly wishful thinking).



There is no ‘money multiplier’ effect on bank lending. Lending in the economy is not controlled directly by the BoE through the amount of central bank money it makes available.



Here is the full report, in all its glory - or you can read it in fullscreen here.###3798||Empty###3799||Empty###3800||So far this year American Eagle Outfitters has lost about 3.5% of share value and a CEO a Jefferies analyst recently called "best in class." As it fights to stay relevant in a teen retail landscape that increasingly favors fast fashion like H&M and Forever 21 the company says severe winter weather is making things worse.

Tuesday, the retail chain reported $1 billion in fourth quarter new revenue, down 7% from the prior year. Net income came in at $10.5 million, down sharply from the $94.8 million in net income the company reported in the same period a year earlier. At 5 cents, earnings per share were well below Wall Street analysts' 26 cent consensus estimate. Adjusted earnings per share were 27 cents.

For the full year American Eagle Outfitters reported $3.3 billion in revenue, down 5%. Net income was $83 million versus $232.1 million in the prior year. Earnings per share came in at 43 cents, a full 20 cents below the Street estimate. Adjusted earnings per share were 74 cents.

"The Company’s results in 2013 were highly disappointing," said interim CEO Jay Schottenstein. "While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations. We’re taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers. Our brands remain incredibly strong and I’m confident in our ability to execute the strategic plan and resume long-term profitable growth.”

Looking ahead the struggling retailer expects winter weather to continue cutting into sales in the first quarter as it weakens demand. Pointing to its 7% decline in same store sales in the fourth quarter the company said it expects adjusted earnings per share to be "approximately breakeven." In the prior first quarter adjusted earnings per share were 18 cents.

Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores, Macy's and Pier 1 have similarly said weather has weighed on sales. Not all retailers, however, are declaring a pinch from the weather. On Monday Urban Outfitters reported mixed results and made no mention of negative weather impacts. In late February Abercrombie & Fitch similarly reported better than expected earnings, also steering clear of snow.

Despite the weak guidance and disappointing fourth quarter earnings, there is hope. Citi analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note on the results, "We believe AEO continues to face pressure from intense promotions (gross margins down a very substantial 935bps), unfavorable weather, negative mall traffic, & teen unemployment; however we believe AEO’s inventory mgmt., improvements to omni-channel, and changes in management are likely to help stabilize the business over time." Chen reiterated a neutral rating.

American Eagle Outfitters shares were down around 5% to $13.50 in pre-market trading following the report, this adds to a more than 30% decline year-over-year.

Law360, New York (March 12, 2014, 1:55 PM EDT) -- Activist investor Bill Ackman is once again going after Herbalife Ltd., the health supplement distributor, saying Tuesday that the company’s structure violates direct-selling laws in China, a country that has become...

Today, eBay issued a notice of an upcoming annual meeting, in which the company asked shareholders flat out to vote against Icahn’s proposal to spin off PayPal. Meanwhile, Icahn issued yet another open letter against current eBay management, in which he accused CEO John Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” that cost stockholders $4 billion.

Carl Icahn has also proposed adding two employees from the Icahn Group to eBay’s board. (Icahn currently owns 2.15% of eBay as of February 18.) eBay has also asked shareholders to reject that proposal.

On the subject of new board members, eBay notes: “The Board of Directors does not endorse any Icahn Group nominee or the Icahn Proposal and unanimously recommends that you vote on the WHITE proxy card or voting instruction form ‘FOR ALL’ of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors and ‘AGAINST’ the Icahn Proposal,” Michael R. Jacobson, company secretary, writes in the SEC filing. “The Board of Directors strongly urges you not to sign or return any proxy card sent to you by the Icahn Group.”

And on the subject of the spinoff proposal, it is equally unequivocal: “The Board has carefully considered this proposal and has unanimously agreed that spinning off the Payments segment (PayPal) into a separately traded public company would not be in the best interests of eBay or its stockholders,” it writes. “The Icahn Proposal is not a new idea to the Board or the Company. The Board, together with management and external advisers, has assessed a spin-off of PayPal several times and continues to believe that each of the Company’s payments and commerce segments are stronger together than apart and see compelling benefits to keeping them together. Therefore the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST the Icahn Proposal.”

From the looks of it, the Icahn letter doesn’t reveal materially any more information than previous statements from the activist investor but it’s mainly about making sure that they continue to have a fresh statement to match those of eBay: it centers specifically on the sale of Skype at what Icahn believed was not a fair price. He claims that Donahoe and his advisers should not have spun off the asset to a consortium that included Andreessen Horowitz, and should have instead settled outstanding intellectual property issues itself and sold the asset directly to Microsoft (or another interested party).

eBay has issued statements against these accusations already, and so has Marc Andreessen.

eBay and key people associated with the company have also explained why the split does not make sense. eBay has highlighted the synergies between the two companies and also how a lot of PayPal’s growth is supported by eBay; while Reid Hoffman argued convincingly about the choice between short-term profit and long-term value creation.

PayPal has recently started rolling out a new website, and it accounted for around 40% of eBay’s $16 billion in revenues in 2013.

The timeline so far, as outlined by eBay in its filing today:

On January 16, 2014, eBay received a notice from the Icahn Group indicating that it intended to nominate two Icahn Group employees to stand for election as directors to the eBay Board of Directors at eBay’s 2014 Annual Meeting. The notice also included a precatory proposal recommending that eBay act expeditiously to engage an investment banking firm to effectuate a spin-off of eBay’s Payments segment into a separately traded company. On January 17, 2014, the Icahn Group notified eBay by letter that it had filed a notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or HSR Act, to enable the Icahn Group to acquire more than $700 million of eBay’s common stock, including any shares that the Icahn Group may already own. On each of January 17 and January 22, 2014, Carl Icahn and John Donahoe, eBay’s President and Chief Executive Officer, had telephone conversations concerning the Icahn Group’s perspectives on eBay and the upcoming annual meeting. No agreements or understandings resulted from these conversations. On January 22, 2014, in connection with eBay’s earnings release and associated conference call, eBay publicly announced that it had received the notice from the Icahn Group regarding the 2014 Annual Meeting. On February 11, 2014, the Icahn Group delivered to eBay an update to its January 16, 2014 notice that included revised biographical information regarding one of the Icahn Group’s proposed nominees and indicated that the Icahn Group had acquired call options that conferred beneficial ownership of approximately 2.15% of eBay’s outstanding common stock. On February 18, 2014, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the HSR Act waiting period to the Icahn Group. Later that day, the Icahn Group notified eBay by letter that it had exercised its call options resulting in the Icahn Group having beneficial ownership of approximately 2.15% of eBay’s outstanding common stock. On February 22, 2014, Mr. Icahn spoke with Mr. Donahoe by telephone. On February 24, 2014, the Icahn Group issued an “open letter” to eBay stockholders that contained various allegations regarding eBay’s Board and seeking support for the Icahn Proposal. eBay responded later that day with a press release stating that the Board welcomed discussion of the Icahn Proposal and rebutting the allegations contained in the Icahn Group’s letter. On February 26, 2014, the Icahn Group submitted a demand to inspect the Company’s books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Icahn Demand”) and on February 28, 2014 submitted a demand to inspect certain eBay stocklist materials. eBay subsequently offered by letter to provide the Icahn Group with documents responsive to their Section 220 demands. In early March 2014, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Icahn spoke by telephone and subsequently had an in-person meeting during which additional representatives of both parties were present. Throughout January, February and March, the Icahn Group and the Company published various solicitation materials.

A Canadian Girl Guide sold out of cookies in under an hour after setting up shop outside a cannabis store on the first day of legal sales. Elina Childs, 9, offloaded 30 boxes of cookies at $5 (£3.83) each outside a licensed shop in Edmonton, Alberta, on Wednesday, the same day Canada became the second country to legalise the possession and use of recreational marijuana. Smoking cannabis is known to trigger uncontrollable urges to eat sugary snacks, commonly known as “the munchies”.###3811||Herbalife (HLF) delivered a dour message Wednesday, revealing that the Federal Trade Commission just opened a probe into the business practices of the multilevel marketer of nutritional supplements and personal care. The announcement prompted trading of HLF stock to be briefly halted Wednesday. After trading restarted, HLF sank and finished the day’s trading down 7%.

The investigation comes on the heels of what many pundits have described a highly unusual lobbying effort by hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman, who in 202 took a $1 billion short position in the Cayman Islands-based company. Ackman has since tried to convince anyone who would listen that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme and has bet against shares.

Meanwhile, other billionaires including Carl Icahn and George Soros jumped in on the other side of the argument and took long positions in HLF stock.

Spurred by Bill Ackman, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and a group called the League of United Latin American Citizens had asked the FTC to investigate the company. The billionaire claims Herbalife is violating Chinese laws, which HLF has vehemently denied.

However, the fact that the FTC is conducting a formal investigation into Bill Ackman’s claims indicates that regulators think the hedge fund tycoon’s criticisms of Herbalife might be valid.

Of course, Herbalife has vowed to “cooperate fully” with the FTC’s probe, noting that it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC.” HLF has denied wrongdoing.

Multilevel marketing (MLM) groups such as Herbalife operate through independent sales representatives, who earn money both through the sales of product and by recruiting other people to join their team. This business model — which is used by scores of companies, including Pampered Chef, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Tupperware (TUP) and Mary Kay Cosmetics — is legal provided that actual products are sold.

If people are only making money by convincing other people to work with them, however, then the enterprise is a pyramid scheme. And if your company is ruled a pyramid scheme … well, you’re in trouble in the U.S. and a host of other countries, which have deemed these schemes illegal.

“Basically, it’s a business of selling hope,” said white-collar crime expert Sam Antar, the former CFO of Crazy Eddie who is a convicted felon, in a Boom Bust interview. “You (make) a better living flipping burgers at McDonald’s.”

The FTC’s probe has the potential to cast a shadow over HLF stock for months, even years. Even if the FTC finds that Herbalife didn’t break any laws, the agency could tighten rules governing MLMs that could raise their cost of doing business significantly. It casts yet another negative light on the industry, which people have long noted promises easier riches than it delivers.

However, the FTC probe is just the latest chapter in Herbalife’s strange history.

For instance, founder Mark Hughes, who enthusiastically sold the company’s products and exposed a philosophy of healthy living, died suddenly in 2000 following from a toxic combination of alcohol and antidepressants after a four-day binge. His death was ruled accidental. What followed was an ugly battle over Hughes’ estate that pitted his widow and its trustees over his $400 million estate. The legal fallout for that case has stretched all the way through this year.

And allegations that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme aren’t new, either. The company faced a few actions related to pyramid scheme accusations in the early aughts. HLF also has been dogged for years by accusations that it was misleading consumers about the health benefits of its products.

Other companies that use the MLM business model have struggled this year, too.

Earlier this year, Chinese newspapers reported claims that Nu Skin (NUS), which provides personal care products, violated the country’s pyramid scheme losses. Although NUS stock was rallying today, shares still remain down more than 40% this year. NuSkin gets more than half of its revenue from the most populous country. Avon (AVP), which is fighting double-digit declines in representatives, is off about 15%. Tupperware is off similarly.

Bottom Line

While shares of other MLM companies aren’t off today, investors should be worried about the eventual fallout from the FTC’s investigation into Herbalife. While HLF stock is the most logical victim in the near-term, any finding that shows Herbalife is in fact a pyramid scheme could give the FTC more courage about other such companies.

As for Herbalife itself, anything but the most speculative money should be kept away from HLF stock until the FTC makes a final decision on its practices. And again, even if Herbalife comes out on top, the world could get a lot tougher for it and other MLMs.

As of this writing, Jonathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.###3812||Empty###3813||Market dazzled by ChinaVision deal

Alibaba's latest deal shows the extent of investors' frenzy for China's Internet. The e-commerce giant announced Tuesday it had agreed to buy 60 percent of Hong-Kong listed ChinaVision for $804 million. The film group's market value promptly soared to almost $5 billion. Star-struck investors are too easily excited.



Investors may be betting on Alibaba moving into digital entertainment - it launched a set-top box and TV operating system last year. ChinaVision's movies and film rights could help give it a toehold in online video and entertainment. But even if Alibaba is successful, it's not clear that would transform the Hong Kong unit's prospects.



Another possibility is that Alibaba wants to use ChinaVision as a backdoor route to a stock market listing. Jack Ma Yun's company is locked in an impasse with Hong Kong stock market regulators over its corporate governance structure. In the unlikely event that Alibaba tried, it's hard to imagine the authorities would allow a company with a likely valuation of more than $100 billion to sneak onto the market.

Stock markets around the world fell today, led by the 246 point dive, or 1.5%, for the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 1.9% drop for German stock market index. Analysts generally pointed to worries about a shrinking Chinese lending and the potential trade war between Russia and the West, but I am more concerned that since the beginning of 2014 food prices have skyrocketed. The Federal Reserve must be concerned that their international support for “cheap money policies” to stimulate economic growth may be funding commodity speculation that is driving prices higher and creating wide spread misery. If the Fed decides to raise interest rates to dampen speculation, I believe stock and commodity prices are in for a hard fall. Margin debt on stocks is now higher than at its last peak in 2008, right before the stock and commodity markets crashed. This willingness to speculate on margin may also explain the big jump in food prices since the first of the year as shown below:

Cattle Hogs Grains Milk Coffee Over the next couple of months, the rise in wholesale commodity prices is going to start hitting consumer pocketbooks very hard. More worrisome, the rising price action will encourage morecommodity futures speculators to jump in and continue the rapid price escalation. If the Fed does not get ahead of this coming tsunami of greed, they will be in a similar situation as when food prices took off in 2008. In April of 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that rising food prices could have terrible consequences for the world, including the risk of war. IMF Managing Director Dominque Strauss-Kahn called for action to keep inflation in check: "Food prices, if they go on like they are doing today” ... “the consequences will be terrible,"… “Hundreds of thousands of people will be starving” ... “(leading) to disruption of the economic environment,”especially for developing nations where the bulk of their income is spent on the bare necessities for survival. Strauss-Hahn emphasized food inflation could destroy 10 years of development progress and spark social unrest: “As we know, learning from the past, those kind of questions sometimes end in war.” It is well known that the Great Credit Crunch of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed was caused by a build-up of speculative borrowing and investing after the 9/11 terrorist attack. What is not very well understood is that the Fed was forced to stop cutting interest rates during the financial crisis because of raging food price inflation The economic impacts of 9/11 threatened to drive America into a deep recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan began deeply cutting interest rates on September 17, 2001, which made it increasingly cheaper to borrow money. The cheap money policy led to strong growth, especially in the interest-sensitive housing sector as Americans started taking on more and more debt and stock and commodity investors took on more leverage. Despite inflation picking up, the Fed waited until 2004 to begin raising rates. Although the Fed moved up rates through 2005, investor frenzy continued as sub-prime lenders in 2006 actually increased the amount of money flowing to speculative investors. As the economy slowed rapidly in mid-2007, the Fed began slowly cutting rates. After Bear Stearns filed for bankruptcy on March 31, 2008, the Fed started cutting rates faster.But as the result of their experience with the stimulus features of 9/11 “cheap money policies”, speculators increased borrowing to buy more stocks and commodities on margin. The buying pressure sent food costs up over 30% and resulted in panic cries from the IMF and poor countries around the world for the Fed to stop driving up inflation and food prices by cutting interest rates. From April through August the Fed held its lending rate steady.But on September 15, 2008 the huge brokerage firm Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Over the next year, numerous financial institutions declared bankruptcy. Even major banks such as J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Citibank were all pushed to the brink. The cascading failures eventually culminated in the Fed’s bailout of AIG, and the government’s nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There will always be international controversies that analysts try to associate with price movements in the stock markets, but seldom have international events had more than a temporary impact. The banking problems in China are significant and the Ukraine Crisis has increased international tension. But if their “cheap money policies” are now funding speculators that are driving up food prices, the Federal Reserve is going curb lending and drive up interest rates. Having failed to be vigilant against food inflation during the last economic crisis, the Federal Reserve may overreact this time. The author welcomes feedback @ chriss@chrissstreetandcompany.com

A policy of deleting historical records at the Bank of England has come under fire, as individuals voice concerns about the implication for transparency.

The tapes of policy setting meetings are routinely deleted - the transcripts destroyed once minutes are agreed upon. Today, Treasury Select Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has asked for the Bank of England to reconsider that policy.

Uniquely opaque

There's an inconsistency here with other public sector documents, such as Cabinet minutes, which must be released under the 30-year rule. If Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussions are of a sensitive nature, surely the same also applies for the meetings of senior politicians.

And elsewhere, the practice of releasing transcripts is now well established.

The US Federal Reserve began releasing minutes after then chairman of the House banking Committee, Henry Gonzalez, demanded their publication in 1993. Since then, they've been published with some time delay.

February saw the release of Fed minutes from the 2008 financial crash. Information that has proved useful to economic historians and modern economists alike.

And the Bank of Japan publishes its transcripts with a 10 year delay. Only the European Central Bank is more opaque among large central banks, electing to release summary minutes a staggering 30 years after meetings take place.

In transparency terms, looks like ECB < BoE < BoJ < Fed — Mike Bird (@Birdyword) March 11, 2014

Bank motivations

As the Financial Times' Chris Giles has highlighted, the MPC has become increasingly monotone in public since Mark Carney's arrival. Speeches reveal less debate than they had previously, while minutes don't give a full picture of the varying viewpoints.

It may be favourable to the Bank to delete historical records - especially when members disagree - but the general silencing of disagreements gives a false impression of ongoing debates at the Bank.

Former Bank of England staffer Tony Yates points out that an incentive exists "to communicate that everything is going to work out fine on the MPC, and all jobs being done well."

That paints a picture of unity that may not exist, as well as clouding understanding of how policy is set. A transparent central bank would adopt a policy of releasing transcripts with a delay.###3818||LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in US$3.5 million (S$4.4 million) in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed.

The figure included US$2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly US$600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue on Monday.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalised pot in 2012, but made drug history on Jan 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 per cent excise tax and a 2.9 per cent sales tax.

"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on Jan 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific North-west state Washington is set to follow suit later this year - even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalisation to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalisation is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.

A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licenced and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Ms Brohl.###3819||Empty###3820||Quiznos sandwich chain has filed for bankruptcy protection this week, according to a report by Reuters.

The chain, touted as the premiere toasted sub sandwich restaurant, reportedly submitted a request for prepackaged bankruptcy - a plan that softens the blow for companies involved in the liquidation process.

According to Reuters, Quiznos officials said reorganizing the company would cut debts by at least $400 million.

Liabilities between $500 million and $1 billion have been listed in the company's bankruptcy bid, Reuters reported on Friday.

"Our business plan includes several key elements aimed at supporting our franchisees, including reducing food costs, implementing a franchise owner rebate program," Chief Executive of Quiznos Stuart Mathis wrote in a company statement.

Quiznos has reportedly gotten $15 million in debtor-in-possession financing from leading lenders to stay in business during the reorganization, Reuters reported.

Competitors like Subway and Potbelly, another sub sandwich franchise, have reportedly cornered Quiznos in one of the toughest bouts of competition yet.

According to Reuters, Subway - Quiznos' main competitor - is one of the largest fast food restaurants worldwide, with more than 41,000 franchises in nearly 100 different nations.

Potbelly's low prices and meal deals have also created issues for Quiznos, Reuters reported.

But the toasted sub company isn't the fast food chain that's encountered problems recently - pizza chain Sbarro filed for bankruptcy this week for the second time in the past three years.###3821||Empty###3822||Empty###3823||Candy Crush Saga creator King Digital Entertainment said it could be worth as much as $7.6 billion in its highly-anticipated initial public offering, French news agency AFP reported.

The London-based developer has said last month that it intended to list on the New York Stock Exchange. It has already priced the 22.2 million shares it plans to sell at anywhere from $21 to $24 per share, giving it a market capitalization of anywhere from $6.6 billion to $7.6 billion, the report said.

In a statement, King said that their estimated net proceeds from the IPO is $326 million. The developer added, "We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions."

The most popular game by the developer is Candy Crush which, according to digital research and consultancy firm IDATE, amasses daily sales of $850,000. The very addictive game, which now records 700 million sessions each day, merely began as a game on Facebook. The object of the game is simply to move sweets in a grid so that the user can get at least three sweets of the same kind in a row. Although the game itself is free, those who do use it can opt to pay for extra help so that they can pass through the game's over 500 levels, the report said.

VentureBeat reported that the Candy Crush Saga is largely credited for the growth of King's revenues. Last year, King posted profits of $568 million on revenues of $1.88 billion mostly because of the popularity of the game.

The planned IPO of King is the newest in a spate of Internet and gaming companies going public in the past three years. The most popular of these public debuts are that of social media platform Facebook and micro-blogging site Twitter, the report said.###3824||Clothing retailer Men's Wearhouse Inc. (MW) has finally reached a deal to buy smaller rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (JOSB) for $1.8 billion in cash, thus ending the months-long takeover battle. Shares of Men's Wearhouse rose over five percent, while Jos A. Bank shares gained about four percent, following the news.

Men's Wearhouse has agreed to pay Jos. A. Bank shareholders $65.00 a share in cash. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the deal and expects to close it by the third quarter, subject to customary approvals and conditions.

The offer represents 56 percent premium over Jos. A. Bank's closing share price on October 8, 2013, the day before the takeover bid was initiated.

Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., with around 23,000 employees and adjusted sales of $3.5 billion.

"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers," said Men's Wearhouse Chief Executive Doug Ewert.

Ewert also indicated that the company expects acquisition to be accretive to its earnings in the first full year.

The takeover saga between Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank began five months ago, when Jos. A. Bank offered to buy its bigger rival Men's Wearhouse for $2.3 billion on October 9. However, Men's Wearhouse immediately rejected that offer, and launched counter bids to buy Jos. A. Bank for $1.2 billion, which was then sweetened to about $1.6 billion.

Last month, Men's Wearhouse raised its offer further to $63.50 a share, or about $1.78 billion, and also offered to up the ante to $65.00 if the clothing retailer accepts some conditions.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Jos. A. Bank terminated its deal to buy Everest Holdings LLC, the parent company of Eddie Bauer and also withdrew its $300 million stock buy back plan.

On February 14, Jos. A. Bank announced a deal to buy Everest Holdings LLC in an attempt to spoil the takeover bid of Men's Wearhouse.

JOSB is currently trading at $64.25, up $2.42 or 3.91%, on the Nasdaq. MW is currently trading at $58.03, up $3.46 or 6.34%, on the NYSE.

Business News###3825||King Digital Entertainment, maker of the wildly popular Candy Crush Saga, has been busy gearing up for its initial public offering later this month.

That's left analysts wondering: Can a company that makes almost 75 percent of its revenue from a single, popular mobile game survive in stock market?

The folks at King hope so.

When the Dublin-based company goes public later this month, it expects to price its shares to be between $21 and $24 each, giving it a valuation of up to $7.6 billion.

"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," Josef Schuster, a Chicago-based research and investment firm, told Reuters.

Now that Twitter and Facebook have experienced success as public companies, it's removed some of the reservations investors had about tech companies having more hype than lasting value.

CB Insights put out an IPO watch report, saying it expects to see travel website Airbnb, cloud storage services Box and Dropbox, wearable camera maker GoPro, cab hailing app Uber and others mull going public in 2014.

While King prepares for its IPO, there's also been a lots of talk about Zynga. The San Francisco-based game company, best known for Farmville, made an initial public offering in late 2011.

Zynga's stock price (ZNGA) started at $10, climbed above $14 in March 2012 and has fallen steadily ever since. In the past year, the price has hovered between $2.50 and $5.89 per share.

Investors took Zynga's very public stumble out of the gate as a sign that tech companies that rely too heavily on one revenue stream leave themselves vulnerable to a constantly changing tide of consumer interests. That's why King, which has 180 other mobile games in its catalog in addition to Candy Crush, has drawn some criticism.

Even before King started gearing up for an IPO, analysts were comparing Candy Crush's success to that of Farmville's.###3826||With two weeks left to register, officials said Monday that Obamacare signups now have hit the 5 million mark, perhaps putting enrollment goals within reach.

Getty Images

Marilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted the milestone on her blog Monday. Tavenner said the 5 million mark was reached over the weekend, a little less than three weeks after CMS officials announced on Feb. 25 they had reached 4 million enrollees. That February mark was reached slightly more than one month after enrollment hit 3 million on Jan. 24.

With the March 31 deadline to enlist in Obamacare, the pace of enrollment clearly is quickening, putting new expectations of 6 million signups now in sight for the Affordable Care Act through public exchanges. The 6 million goal was lowered by the Congressional Budget Office from 7 million after difficulties with HealthCare.gov prompted researchers to rethink the numbers.

A brisk campaign waged by President Obama along with members of his administration hopes to boost enrollment via either a handful of state-run exchanges or the federal HealthCare.gov site. Obama himself has made some unusual appearance in hopes of getting young adults to sign up.

The president last week showed up on the website “Funny or Die” with Zach Galifianakis and traded a few barbs with the comic actor as he plugged his signature legislative achievement. Then he showed up on WebMD.com to answer questions from readers.

The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.

Spokesmen for the Justice Department and GM would not comment. The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg News.

Delay questioned

At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide (including in Canada), even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner.

GM announced last month it will replace ignition switches that can shut off car motors unexpectedly. When that happens, drivers lose power-assisted steering and brakes and can lose control of the cars. The ignition can slip from the run position to accessory or off, due partly to heavy key chains dangling from the steering column.

Also, if the ignition switch isn't in the run position, air bags may not inflate if a crash occurs.

An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found that drivers started submitting complaints about the problem in early 2005, shortly after the first Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale. The review of complaints about the Cobalt, GM's top-selling small car in the mid-2000s, found 173 instances of engine stalling or air bags failing to deploy, both symptoms of the ignition problem. Many drivers reported problems with keys sticking in the ignition in addition to the stalling.

Fred Upton of Western Michigan, the chairman of the House committee, said in a statement Monday that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks.

Marketing expert Ken Wong of Queen's University says the damage to GM's reputation is enormous. "[It's] catastrophic, not only because the incident occurred, but because there is substantial evidence that GM was aware of the incident long before it took any corrective action."

Bad publicity

Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to NHTSA. The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.

Upton said the committee wants to know if GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.

"If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended," Upton said.

NHTSA has said the rate of problems in the GM cars was not significantly different from similar vehicles.

The prospect of congressional hearings means more bad publicity for GM, which is trying to distance itself from a reputation for building lousy cars. The company has said it's more focused on quality since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009.

"It's the old GM haunting the new GM," said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports magazine. "They have a lot of the old products still hanging around."

Fisher said GM's new cars and trucks will have to be better than the competition to lure back buyers who swore years ago to never again to buy a GM car.

NHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the ignition problem. The agency could fine GM up to $35 million for a delayed response. Automakers must report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them.

GM said in a statement that it's co-operating with NHTSA and the House committee.

On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).

GM said Monday that it has hired attorney Anton Valukas to investigate the company's actions before the recall. Valukas, who investigated the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers for a bankruptcy court. GM has promised an "unvarnished" investigation into the recall.###3828||Empty###3829||Empty###3830||LONGMONT, Colo. — A Colorado company is providing satellite images to the public and asking people to help search for the missing Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777.

"A week after this plane went missing, nobody can tell us with any authority where it went or why it went where it did. And now it's just a painstaking process where patience is going to be required for people who want answers right now," said CBS News correspondent Bob Orr on "Face the Nation" Sunday.

Earlier in the day, Malaysian officials revealed that the plane's data communication system had been partially disabled prior to the final communication from the plane's cockpit . The pilots did not indicate any trouble on board, suggesting a possible intent to mislead ground control. They have now become a central part of the investigation, along with all ground staff, crew and passengers.

Although it's still too early to draw conclusions about a potential hijacking or rogue pilots, Orr said the available evidence that the plane changed course and altitude and flew for a long time after the last communication with ground control suggests a level of sophistication by whoever was controlling the plane.

"This didn't look like an airplane completely out of control by any means," Orr said. "What I think we can say is whoever disabled those systems, if it was done intentionally, and whoever changed the course of that airplane and flew to a stop where they knew they had no radar coverage, there was some level of knowledge, some sophistication, a knowledge about how that plane worked, how systems worked, and how you would want to go about being undetectable."

Capt. Chesley Sullenberger, CBS News' Aviation and Safety Expert, said there will be "great efforts" and "huge sums" to solve the mystery, though it could take months or years to understand what happened if investigators are unable to find the plane.

"The aviation industry never normally tolerates this level of ambiguity," he said. "The real frustration is that we are learning more about this...very late in the process. And with the passage of time, it makes the variability in the search much greater and it makes it much harder ultimately to find out what really did happen."

Many of the possibilities, he said, "verge on a spy novel kind of situation."

Mark Rosenker, the CBS News Aviation Safety Analyst and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said the investigation is unlike any other he has ever seen. He questioned why the Malaysian Air Force did not respond once the pilots failed to check in with Vietnamese air controllers.

"Where was the Malaysian Air Force?" he asked. "Where were they to not come up, do an interception and try to figure out what was going on? This is absolutely extraordinary to have an airliner fly over that area without the Malaysian Air Force trying to understand what it was," he said.

Overall, it's still too early to draw conclusions given the lack of physical evidence.

"This plane still may be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. And I think a lot of folks that I talk to believe that's probably the most likely, the most probable circumstances that in fact it is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. But you cannot quite yet rule out everything else, because we don't have the physical evidence we need to come to that conclusion," said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

There's also a chance there will never be any physical evidence.

"I think as time goes on...with an area this large to search, I think it is possible as hard as it is to believe, that we may never find the plane," Orr said. "And if we don't find the plane, if we don't find some kind of conclusive analytics evidence on the police side, I think there is a chance we might not know."###3832||Empty###3833||BEIJING, March 15 -- Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines jetliner was likely to be a deliberate act, and authorities had refocused their investigation on its crew members and passengers.



"Based on new satellite information, we can say with a high degree of certainty that the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system, or ACARS, was disabled just before the aircraft reached the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia," he told a press conference.



He said the last satellite contact with the missing flight was at 8:11 am local time (0011 GMT) last Saturday, nearly seven hours after it disappeared from air traffic control radar.



Citing Malaysian air force radar data, the prime minister confirmed previous speculation the missing flight did turn back westward, recrossing the Malaysian peninsula before turning northwest.



"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.



"In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board," Najib said.



Based on the new data, the Malaysian authorities are now trying to trace the missing jet in one of the two possible corridors -- a northern one from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and a southern one stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.



But he did not confirm speculation the plane had been hijacked.



"Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear: We are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate from its original flight path," he said.



Earlier, media reports quoted experts as saying one of the pilots or someone else with flying experience hijacked the plane or committed suicide by plunging the jet into the sea.



Meanwhile, the prime minister said the search in the South China Sea would end and authorities were reassessing the redeployment of assets.



"Clearly, the search for MH 370 has entered a new phase," he said.



Focus of the search for the missing Malaysian plane has shifted westward to the Indian Ocean, seven days after it lost contact with ground control.



Vo Van Tuan, deputy chief of the General Staff of Vietnam People's Army, told reporters Vietnam had decided to end the search mission for the missing jet after Vietnam receiving information from Vietnamese Ambassador to Malaysia Nguyen Hong Thao Saturday afternoon that Malaysia had decided to end search in the South China Sea.



China on Saturday urged Malaysia to continue providing more "thorough and correct information" about the missing flight MH370.



Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China attached great importance to the latest news from the Malaysian government about the missing plane.



"It is the eighth day since MH370 lost contact with its radar signal and time is life," Qin said.



"We urge Malaysia to expand and define the search area for the missing plane and increase the intensity of the search," Qin said, adding China needed Malaysia to call on more countries to participate in the search.



Chinese vessels continued their search Saturday, with two of them heading for the Strait of Malacca.



The missile destroyer Haikou is expected to arrive in the east of the Strait of Malacca later Saturday, after searching for the missing MH370 in the Gulf of Thailand for more than 70 hours.



Another vessel, Yongxingdao, equipped with underwater robots and rescue boats, will also move towards the Strait of Malacca after it finishes its search to the east of the Gulf of Thailand.



Other Chinese warships continued to broaden the search area to the southeast of the Gulf of Thailand, combing a total of 5,100 square nautical miles (about 17,400 square km).



Warships Jinggangshan, Kunlunshan (an amphibious transport dock), and Mianyang (a missile frigate) have so far searched a sea area of 2,400 square nautical miles (about 8,200 square km).



Flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200ER, went missing on its way to Beijing last Saturday morning, shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. The plane was carrying 12 crew and 227 passengers, including 154 Chinese.



A multinational hunt for the missing passenger jet has entered a second week, but no hard evidence has been found.

###3834||Colorado made $3.5m ‘pot’ tax in January

posted March 11, 2014 at 09:01 pm by AFP March 11, 2014 at 09:01 pm

LOS ANGELES—Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday. The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado’s Department of Revenue. The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear. Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

Washington — House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health-care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act



The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.



The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.



But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with members outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,” with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents.



“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in an interview. “We’ve got all of these bills out there, so we’re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.”



Republicans have campaigned heavily on their opposition to the health-care law in this year’s congressional elections, betting that anger with the law will propel them to gain seats in the House and take control of the Senate. Those efforts accelerated last week after Republican David Jolly’s upset victory in a special House election in Florida in which the campaigns focused on the law.



In meetings with Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, last week, House leadership allies cast Florida as a sign of good things to come in November. But they also cautioned that Republicans needed to offer a clearer alternative.



“It’s going to be all about giving people a choice,” said Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., an anesthesiologist.



Democrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture ahead of this year’s midterm elections, saying the focus on long-held conservative ideas was more of an attempt to rally Republicans than to find bipartisan solutions.



“If they had fixes, I’d certainly consider it,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. “But if they are trying to scrap it all, going back to the bad old days, it’s not going to go anywhere.”



A CNN-ORC International survey released last week showed support for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly, with 39 percent of Americans saying they support the health-care law, up from 35 percent in December. Fifty-seven percent of those polled oppose the law, down from 62 percent in December. The Republicans’ plan is hardly intended as a full replacement of the federal health-care law —- and that is by design. They would prefer to see a shift away from the federal government and to the states, with an emphasis on getting more consumers on private plans.



As they finalize their alternative, House Republicans are continuing their years-long effort to take a legislative hammer to the law, passing a bill Friday that would delay the individual mandate and repeal Medicare’s sustainable-growth rate.



For the most part, House Democrats are not taking the bait. Outside the House floor Thursday, Rep. Ron Barber, Ariz., a Tucson-area Democrat facing a difficult reelection race, said that he would like to “make some amendments and adjustments” to the health-care law but added that “the bill is the law and not going anywhere.”



At a news conference Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats would not run away from the law and shrugged off talk that Florida could be a harbinger of looming Democratic losses in the House and Senate.



“I’m very proud of our House Democrats and how they have not only embraced the Affordable Care Act, because they helped create it, but how proud they are of it,” she said. “I think the Republicans are wasting their time using that as their electoral issue, and they will find that out.”



McCarthy, along with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Wash., the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, formed a 30-member working group, dubbed the House Obamacare Accountability Project, in May.



vetting suggestions over long lunches and reporting back to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.. The group has met once every two weeks, usually in McCarthy’s spacious Capitol suite.



“The first priority was establishing trust, and then we moved forward,” McMorris Rodgers said. “We’ve touched every part of the philosophical range.”



The policies on the group’s radar have a conservative streak, and the academics and analysts consulted during early deliberations were largely drawn from conservative think tanks, with talks by James Capretta, a former official in the George W. Bush administration; Avik Roy, a writer for National Review; and Dennis Smith, a former adviser to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, R.



Conservative leaders in the House, such as Rep. Tom Price, Ga., a physician from the Atlanta suburbs, and Rep. Steve Scalise, La., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, have also played critical roles. Their involvement has enabled leadership to avoid complaints from the right flank - and ensured that Republicans would not veer from conservative doctrine.



But some conservatives remain wary of the push to have House Republicans sing as a unified chorus. At Wednesday’s Weyrich Lunch on Capitol Hill, a gathering of hard-right operatives named after the late Paul Weyrich, there was much skepticism about the leadership’s strategy, with conservatives urging their allies to be wary.



McMorris Rodgers, who gave the party’s official response to Obama’s State of the Union address in January, played down tensions, saying the early outline is a blend of four previous GOP bills: a replacement plan produced by the Republican Study Committee; a bill authored by Price; a Senate Republican proposal; and the House GOP’s 2009 alternative to the Affordable Care Act.



Next month, when the House breaks for its April recess, McMorris Rodgers will provide members with a PowerPoint presentation on the GOP plan and will later hold sessions to collect feedback on how the recommendations went over at town-hall meetings. Publicizing stories of people who have seen premium increases is a priority.



“It’s not enough to say, ‘I told you so,’ “ McCarthy said. “The country has changed since Obamacare has come in - we understand that. But we’re going to offer specific ideas, making the big-picture case and on the micro level.”



A complete health-care overhaul remains the GOP’s overarching goal. GOP leaders, however, are open to adopting conservative versions of elements from the law. Regarding people with preexisting conditions, for instance, they point to the high-risk insurance pools, which would be managed and subsidized by states. On allowing children to stay on their parents’ health plans until age 26, they said Republicans may back that policy.



Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are closely watching the House GOP’s activity. Earlier this year, Sens. Tom Coburn, Okla., Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Richard Burr, N.C., proposed their own alternative, which they suggested could be the basis for the party-wide pitch on health care.



“There are only so many answers - that’s the thing,” Coburn said. “I don’t care about the politics of it. I want to solve the problem. Eventually we’re going to have to roll up our sleeves and have some kind of combined message.”









###3836||(Adds background on U.S. approvals process, legislation, and lack of LNG terminals in Ukraine)

By Roberta Rampton

ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE, March 7 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

“There is no indication currently that there’s much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region,” he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

“So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect,” Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine’s dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

“Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well,” he said.

The SEALs boarded the tanker Morning Glory late Sunday in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea near Cyprus. Rear Adm. John Kirby said no one was injured in the operation, which was approved by President Barack Obama.

The vessel, whose ownership remains a mystery, was carrying stolen Libyan crude oil from the port of Al-Sidra.

The move isn\’t a big surprise, but it is viewed as another significant step toward a freer-floating currency at the same time concerns are on the rise over a possible credit crunch and a slowdown of the world\’s second-largest economy.

China has been seen guiding the yuan lower since the beginning of 2013. Analysts say China wants to discourage market participants from engaging in a popular strategy known as a carry trade, in which traders sell a low-interest currency, such as the U.S. dollar, and use it to buy higher-yielding currencies, such as the yuan, and other assets. Read more about the development of the yuan carry trade.

A stronger yuan makes Chinese exports more expensive to foreign buyers. Heavy inflows of foreign funds also contribute to soaring prices for property and other assets, stoking bubble fears.

The yuan, however, has already gone from being one of the most attractive emerging-market carry trades to one of the worst by the end of February, according to Bloomberg . Indeed, analysts at Societe Generale had noted that the yuan rose nearly 3% against the dollarand 7% in nominal effective exchange-rate terms in 2013. The yuan has fallen around 1.6% versus the dollar since the beginning of this year, ending Friday at 6.15 per dollar. According to The Wall Street Journal, the yuan is up more than 30% against the U.S. currency since a 2005 revaluation that eliminated the yuan\’s peg to the greenback.

The move \”is coming at a time when a credit crunch should be creating outflows out of China, suggesting that the timing indicates an interest in weakening [the yuan] or at least [inflicting] significant pain\” on the yuan carry trade, said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale, by email.

It also comes at a time when a weaker yuan has been tied to a sharp drop in copper prices, which has also amplified worries about the stability of China\’s financial system.

About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.92 (0.29 percent) to 16,404.80.

The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 2.09 (0.11 percent) to 1,875.95, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.37 (0.01 percent) lower to 4,335.85.

Weekend economic data from China raised questions about the outlook for the world's second largest economy.

Beijing reported weak inflation data and a $23.0 billion trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $11.9 billion surplus.

Meanwhile Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 percent, than the previously reported 0.3 percent.

Investors are also skittish over tensions between Russia and the West after Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Crimea had the right to join his country.

McDonald's became the latest big company to cite cold weather as a factor in diminished sales, saying frigid temperatures in the US were a factor in a 1.4 percent drop in comparable restaurant sales in February. Shares of the Dow component dipped 0.4 percent.

Boeing fell 1.9 percent after Japan Airlines Sunday said its Dreamliner jet made an emergency landing in Honolulu reportedly due to a possible problem with its hydraulic system.

The news followed a Friday Boeing disclosure that hairline cracks were found in the wings of some of its 787 Dreamliners that are still in production, due to a manufacturing problem.

Chiquita Brands International announced it was combining with Irish company Fyffes into a global produce distributor with a combined equity value of about $1.1 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the new company. Chiquita jumped 12.6 percent.

Bond prices were mixed. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury held steady at 2.79 percent, the same level as Friday, while the 30-year edged higher to 3.73 percent from 3.72 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.###3843||× PRELIMINARY INFORMATION FORM

The announcement confirms the plans for an IPO in the U.S. ending many weeks of speculation over the place the company would have its shares listed after its talks for a stock sale in Hong Kong fell through in 2013.

Alibaba is one of the biggest companies on the Internet in the world and says over $150 billion in merchandise changes hands, each year on its platforms online, which is more than eBay and Amazon, combined.

Alibaba started as just a service for linking suppliers in China with retailers located abroad. However, it has spread into e-commerce retail.

It is not known that much abroad. However, it has launched two services, which are consumer oriented, in the U.S.

The company released a prepared statement that said it decided to start the process of an IPO in the U.S. The statement added that by doing that it would make a more global company enhancing the transparency of the business, as well as allowing it to continue its pursuit of its ideals and long term vision.

There were no details released as to the size or timing of the IPO or which exchange it was taking place on. Analysts estimated that the IPO for Alibaba would raise as much as $15 billion and that the company would be worth over $100 billion.

Alibaba, based in Hangzhou, China previously abandoned its plans for a Hong Kong IPO because the stock exchange in Chinese financial center that is semiautonomous refused to change rules it has in order to accommodate the unusual management structure the company uses.

Alibaba could not persuade the exchange in Hong Kong to grant an exception from its listing rules so it could keep a structure of a partnership that allows the company’s top executives who own 10% of the business to retain board control.

The company did say that the door was not shut completely on listing in Hong Kong.###3845||###3846||Singapore: Gold extended gains to a third session on Thursday, scaling fresh six-month highs as investors sought to hedge their bets against geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and economic slowdown fears in China.

Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14 per cent so far this year on the global uncertainties.

A recent bond default in China and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower. More data on Thursday showed China’s economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows.

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,371.76 an ounce by 0737 GMT, after jumping 1.3 percent on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit $1,374.85, its highest since Sept. 10.

Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near $1,355 an ounce.

“Given bullion’s technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions,” HSBC analysts said in a note.

“Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold.”

Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at $1,375-$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards $1,433.31, the Aug. 28 high.

The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year.

However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday - the first decline since Feb. 19.

Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China - the biggest bullion consumer - trading at a discount to spot prices.

The update, which will include a “shake to pay” feature and a more streamlined design, is a response to customers’ growing preference for mobile payment options.

“With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we’re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,” said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks.

Starbucks noted that digital tipping has long been a popular suggestion on MyStarbucksIdea.com, where customers offer suggestions to improve service.

“As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have also asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to store partners,” said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S., Americas and Teavana. “We’re proud to offer digital tipping as an option through the updated Starbucks for iPhone app for customers in the U.S.”

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington State sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado's pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That's a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado's roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn't guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

"The whole world wants to belly up to this trough," said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado's budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.

"Colorado's going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn't," said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana's tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado's pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado's pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state's unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year's pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it's unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado's Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

"There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don't think it's going to be that simple," said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado's 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.

Growth in industrial production in China slowed to 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014, compared to a 9.7 percent expansion in December, and growth in retail sales narrowed to 11.8 percent from 13.1 percent in December, MarketWatch reported. A Wall Street Journal consensus estimate had pegged industrial production to expand at 9.5 percent and retail sales to grow at 13.5 percent.

Analysts at Societe Generale attributed the fall in retail sales to “anti-corruption drive and disinflation” while pinning the slowing of industrial production on rising inventories, according to MarketWatch.

Earlier, Premier Li Keqiang reportedly gave his vote of confidence to the future of the Chinese economy at a press conference to mark the conclusion of the National People’s Congress.

“The Chinese economy has great potential and resilience. We are capable of, and have the conditions to make sure the economy runs within a reasonable range,” he said, according to MarketWatch, before adding: “The situation this year is more complicated.”

The Shanghai Composite index, which had climbed to trade up 1.3 percent following Li’s comments lost some of its gains after the data release and was trading up 0.81 percent in late-afternoon trade. The Hang Seng index, which had rallied to trade up 0.5 percent subsequently fell to trade down 0.4 percent.###3854||Empty###3855||###3856||Why did this happen?

The Wall Street Journal said U.S. officials suspect the plane continued flying for four hours after its last contact

No plane debris found at spot shown by satellite images

Oil rig worker saw Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 go down

‘All right, good night’: Last words from missing plane

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Malaysia’s defence minister has denied reports that engine data from the missing Malaysian jetliner indicated it may have kept flying for four hours after its last communication.

Acting Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein was referring to reports that the Rolls Royce engines aboard the Boeing 777 automatically sent data to the engine manufacturer as part of a maintenance program.

The Wall Street Journal said U.S. officials suspect the plane continued flying for four hours after its last contact, based on data from the engines.

Hishammuddin said Thursday that both Rolls Royce and Boeing said that report was wrong.

No plane debris found at spot shown by satellite images

Malaysia’s civil aviation chief says no plane debris was found at a location shown by China’s satellite images.

China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday the largest of the suspected pieces of debris measures about 24 metres (79 feet) by 22 metres (72 feet).

CCTV America tweeted the satellite images Wednesday afternoon but noted they had not verified their authenticity.

Oil rig worker saw Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 go down

Earlier Wednesday it was reported that an oil rig worker claimed he saw Flight 370 crash while working off the south coast of Vietnam.

ABC News correspondent Bob Woodruff obtained a copy of an email the man said he sent to his employer stating he witnessed the crash.

“I believe I saw the Malaysia Airlines plane come down. The timing is right,” the man said in the email. “I tried to contact the Malaysian and Vietnam officials several days ago. But I don’t know if the message has been received.”

Last words from missing Malaysian plane

“All right, good night” were the final words heard by air traffic controllers from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight before it vanished over the South China Sea five days ago, relatives of the passengers were told Wednesday.

News of the last communication came as Malaysia defended its handling of the hunt for the missing Boeing 777 but acknowledged it is still unsure which direction the plane was headed when it disappeared, highlighting the massive task facing the international search.

Government officials said they asked India to join in the search near the Andaman Sea, suggesting they think the jetliner and the 239 people on board might have reached those waters after crossing into the Strait of Malacca, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) from the flight’s last known co-ordinates.###3859||At least two states are re­quest­ing a longer Obama­care en­roll­ment peri­od—and they might get it.

The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion has been very clear that the en­roll­ment dead­line for health in­sur­ance pur­chased on the ex­changes is March 31, and that it doesn’t think it has the au­thor­ity to ex­tend it. But be­cause some con­sumers con­tin­ue to have trouble sign­ing up, of­fi­cials are eye­ing a “spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od” that would vir­tu­ally ex­tend the dead­line to get cov­er­age.

Nevada and Ore­gon hope to qual­i­fy for one of the health law’s spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­ods. Con­sumers in both states have faced tech­nic­al is­sues in get­ting cov­er­age: Ore­go­ni­ans still don’t have a func­tion­ing on­line ex­change, and Nevadans are re­ceiv­ing er­ror mes­sages and hit­ting oth­er site glitches re­min­is­cent of Health­Care.gov‘s early days.

Just un­der 39,000 Ore­go­ni­ans and 29,000 Nevadans had suc­cess­fully se­lec­ted a plan as of March 1, ac­cord­ing to data from the Health and Hu­man Ser­vices De­part­ment—few­er than 1.6 per­cent of all Obama­care en­rollees na­tion­wide.

State ex­change of­fi­cials have reached out to HHS to re­quest per­mis­sion to ex­tend the en­roll­ment peri­od. Ore­gon ex­change spokes­wo­man Ariane Holm said the state is seek­ing an ex­ten­sion through the end of April. Nevada is look­ing at up to 60 days, as per­mit­ted by law.

Nich­olas Bagley, a health law pro­fess­or at the Uni­versity of Michigan Law School, wrote a post on the “con­sid­er­able dis­cre­tion” HHS has in grant­ing spe­cial-en­roll­ment peri­ods for The In­cid­ent­al Eco­nom­ist, an eco­nom­ics and health blog. HHS, he said, has the leg­al au­thor­ity to grant spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­ods for con­sumers who had tried to get cov­er­age but could not.

HHS of­fi­cials have avoided re­peated ques­tions about wheth­er a state could qual­i­fy for a spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od and em­phas­ized that con­sumers should sign up by March 31, the end of open en­roll­ment.

But the ad­min­is­tra­tion has already made some tweaks to that dead­line, and it wouldn’t be un­char­ac­ter­ist­ic to grant lee­way to con­sumers who tried but could not get cov­er­age, giv­en the num­ber of changes made last Decem­ber in try­ing to get people in­sured who wanted cov­er­age be­gin­ning Jan. 1. And just Fri­day, of­fi­cials an­nounced con­sumers with ser­i­ous ill­nesses covered un­der the law’s Pre-ex­ist­ing Con­di­tion In­sur­ance Pro­gram can now se­lect a new ex­change plan through April 15.

The Wall Street Journ­al also re­por­ted Sunday that fed­er­al of­fi­cials are work­ing on a plan to al­low con­sumers who tried but failed to get through Health­Care.gov by March 31 to sign up after the dead­line.

Ore­gon of­fi­cials, The Ore­go­ni­an re­por­ted late last week, are hop­ing for a sim­il­ar re­prieve for the state’s res­id­ents.

And in Nevada, the Las Ve­gas Sun re­ports, the state is already mak­ing uni­lat­er­al moves to set up a spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od. It’s un­clear wheth­er Nevada has the au­thor­ity, giv­en that HHS has not is­sued guidelines for how the spe­cial-en­roll­ment peri­ods would work, but the board of dir­ect­ors of Nevada’s ex­change has a vote sched­uled Thursday on the mat­ter.###3860||Empty###3861||Empty###3862||Charleston, SC (29403)

The current bull run is not the longest, or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the United States (US) government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.

Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 178 per cent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.

A bull market is a rise of 20 per cent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 per cent or more. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.

current bull

The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P 500 index fell 3.6 per cent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the US economy. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Barack Obama and several other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.

Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.

There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October 1990 and March 2000. The average bull market lasts 41⁄2 years, making the current one longer than average.

The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was taking hold. The S&P 500 index dropped 57 per cent from a record high of 1,565.15 on October 9, 2009, before bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.

We’ve seen a lot of that at HBO….There’s a lot of repeat viewing.” Some analysts are beginning to wonder whether services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime — which thrive from their ability to show TV reruns — might suffer as programmers let cable companies offer episodes almost immediately after they first air on ad-supported VOD where fast-forwarding is disabled. But Bewkes says that TV viewing “will go up dramatically because there’ll be more opportunities for you to see it.…TV will become more accessible and you’ll still have your [online subscription VOD] backup service. It’s like a sandwich. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Like other media execs appearing at the investor confab, Bewkes appeared unruffled by Comcast’s $45.2B plan to buy Time Warner Cable. “In the short run we don’t think there’ll be much change in our situation…In the long run there are some questions about changes in competition that we’ll look at and the government will look at.” He adds that his company hasn’t decided whether it will change its name — a question raised as Time Warner plans to sell Time Inc, and to avoid confusion with TWC. “It would be good if those Time Warner Cable trucks didn’t say Time Warner,” Bewkes says. “People are calling me.”

The Time Warner chief says that he’s not “philosophically opposed” to the advent of services that offer pay TV channels via the Internet. While he wonders whether service providers have the capacity to handle so much video streaming, he adds that he’s “open to do it as long as it’s additive.” He’s skeptical, though, that a service would work if it offers fewer channels than cable or satellite companies do but at a lower price. When distributors have tried them “consumers don’t elect to have them very often.”

While Bewkes mostly focused on TV, the main source of his company’s revenues, he says he expects to see growth at Warner Bros. Unlike most movie studios, “we haven’t had a volatile business as Warner Bros and we’ve been the biggest studio company in terms of revenue for the last 5 to 10 years.” He attributes that to the fact that the studio “operates with more tentpoles per year and more scale” than its rivals. And it’s a powerhouse in TV production with 32 shows across the four top broadcast networks. So there’s “a very strong demand situation, and therefore profitability, for the studio….So far, so good. Right?”###3870||Empty###3871||After a shaky beginning the FTSE, with some help from the US, has managed to turn things around. In today’s Q&A session for Mark Carney, we have seen the first chinks in his armour as MPs grilled him over how aware the Bank of England was that LIBOR might be rigged. Regardless of whose watch this occurred on, Mark Carney is the one facing the music now. The calm trading environment that the FTSE has enjoyed today has appeared as quickly as yesterday’s flurry of panicked trading materialised, but one suspects that the panic is just around the corner waiting for further military incidents in Ukraine.

Traders await retailer IPO's

Tomorrow will see the beginning of conditional trading in both Pets at Home and Poundland. IG’s grey market has both companies trading at a premium to their IPO listings, which might seem overly optimistic. However, last year IG clients predicted that Royal Mail would start trading at over £4, versus its listing price of £3.30. Given that they also came within a few cents of Twitter's valuation on its first day of trading, we could see a similar strong start for tomorrow’s stock market debutantes.

Ex-prime minister Gordon Brown has added his opinion to the devolution debate over Scotland. All of this has once again muddied the waters for those companies based north of the border, but business south of the border has ensured the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland head the list of today’s FTSE fallers.

Yellen's comments soothe US markets

Monthly US wholesale inventories have crept higher as business spending has eased. However, that has not stopped the markets from heading higher. Words of comfort from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen over the US markets' ability to withstand further reductions to the US debt-purchasing scheme have been taken well by all the major US equity markets. Most of the current uncertainties are happening over in Europe and, as such, it has given US traders the ability to focus on stock specifics rather than the macro issues. In an aggressive reversal of sentiment from yesterday’s disappointing figures, McDonald's has seen its shares trade 3.5% higher in early trading.

Gold lacking conviction

Brazilian coffee growers will be hoping that the chances of El Nino conditions increase, as the current lack of rainfall continues to squeeze the arabica coffee price ever higher; the spot price is now up 83% in 2014 alone. Indecision is rife with the Brent crude price, as the last five trading days have seen the commodity break and retake its 50-,100- and 200-day moving averages. Gold's dalliance with $1350 continues, as it keeps showing the desire to break above this level yet lacks the commitment needed to carry out this move.

EUR/USD fails to break through highs

With comments flying from both the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and the latest EU finance ministers' meeting in Brussels, EUR/USD has failed to break through its highs from earlier in the week and now appears to be suffering from a touch of vertigo.

China gold price below London spot

Last year we frequently commented on the high premiums in China, the opposite is now the case as gold trades at a discount to the spot gold price. Overnight prices in Shanghai were trading $3 below London prices, significantly low when compared to premiums of $20 earlier this year. Analysts believe buyers are in a cooling off mode following Chinese New Year and are waiting to see if the price will fall back.

China sees ‘explosion’ in gold, silver futures contracts

Speaking of China, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) said yesterday that the largest growth in gold futures trading activity, in the last five years, has come from China. There was a 416% increase in the number of gold futures contracts traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange between 2008 and 2013, from 4.39 million contracts to 20.09 million.

The growth seen on the SHFE was in stark contrast to the gold contracts on COMEX where gold options traded came sixth place in volume growth between 2008 and 2013 with 10.69 million contracts traded in last year, an increase of 141% from 2008 when there were 4.39 million contracts.

Silver, which is often ignored in the China story, as the gold numbers are always considered more headline-worthy, deserves a special mention here when it comes to futures contracts on the SHFE. In 2012, the 15 kg silver contract apparently ‘exploded’ in popularity. Launched in 2012, the 15kg silver contracts saw 21.26 million contracts traded in the first year. In 2013, 173.22 million were traded.

Future is golden for PGMs prices

The PGMs will continue to do well as thanks to a public spat breaking out between the parties involved in the wage negotiations. The talks surrounding the labour and mines dispute have been ongoing for seven weeks now. This latest development is likely to put further pressure on the price of both platinum and palladium.

Why Jim Rogers isn’t buying gold

In a great interview with IB Times, legendary investor Jim Rogers explains why he is still not buying gold, despite the huge correction seen last year:

I still am not buying gold in any big way yet, because there are still too many mystics, too many people who think that gold is holy. I don’t see how the markets can make a bottom until a lot of those mystics get shaken out of the market. Once they throw in the towel, then gold will make a significant bottom, and I hope I’ll be buying a lot more at that time.###3874||Why did this happen?

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down a point to 1,866 as of noon Wednesday. It was down as much as 13 points earlier.The Dow Jones industrial average fell four points to 16,346. The Nasdaq composite rose eight points to 4,315. Seven of the 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500 index fell.

CHINA IN SPOTLIGHT: The catalyst for the latest market downturn was news this week that Chinese exports slumped in February. Since China is a big consumer of raw materials and energy, commodities such as copper and iron ore have dropped sharply. Copper has fallen to its lowest level since 2010.

''We've been seeing these periodic, occasional weak data points come out of China,'' said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''And each time that happens when our markets are at all-time record highs, they're going to be very sensitive to any sort of negative news and there'll be days of profit-taking.''

SECTOR VIEW: Eight of the 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500 index fell, with utilities and energy bucking the trend. Among the S&P 500 index's big decliners were insurer Progressive, which shed 62 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $23.90, and homebuilder PulteGroup, which slid 43 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $19.50 following a report that applications for home loans declined from a week ago.

DIGGING DEEP: Mining companies topped the list of gainers in the S&P 500 index in morning trading. Cliffs Natural Resources led the pack, rising 78 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $18.77. Newmont Mining added 42 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $24.77.

DRUG CONCERNS: Geron plunged $2.83, or 64.2 percent, to $1.58 in morning trading. Concerns about potential liver damage prompted U.S. federal regulators to order research suspended on its blood disorder drug.

EUROPE: Germany's DAX fell 1.5 percent, the CAC-40 in France fell 1.4 percent and Britain's FT-SE lost 1 percent.

ASIA: Earlier, Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 1.7 percent. China's Shanghai composite dropped 0.2 percent. South Korea's Kospi shed 1.6 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 slid 2.6 percent. The Bank of Japan decided not to expand its already lavish monetary stimulus following a 2-day policy meeting.

With the March 31 enrollment deadline only two weeks away, a top administration official reported a big upswing in public interest in subsidized health insurance and said traffic on the federal website HealthCare.gov reached 1 million visitors over the weekend.

“The last several days have been the busiest since December,” Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a government blog posting that announced the new total.

The 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.

The CBO initially forecast 7 million enrollees in private health coverage, but scaled back its estimate after technical problems with the rollout that continue to afflict Obamacare insurance marketplaces operated by several states.

Monday’s release did not say how many new enrollees were adults aged 18 to 34, a younger demographic whose participation is seen as essential for the success of President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement.

Before the rollout, administration officials said their goal was for 38 percent of the new online private insurance marketplaces to consist of younger consumers, who compensate for older, sicker enrollees because they tend to be healthy and cheaper to ensure. But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.

Another important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group, but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co in a report this month put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees

Too few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.

“Five million is only a good number if it’s mostly people who didn’t have insurance before,” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

MARCH 31 DEADLINE

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.

But the 2010 law’s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration would not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.

But the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods. With huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March.

Separately, California’s state health insurance exchange said on Monday its enrollment passed the 1 million mark, with 1,018,315 people selecting a health plan through the exchange as of Saturday. Those numbers are part of the Obamacare enrollment figures.

“California continues to lead the nation in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the numbers released today illustrate strong progress in the push to expand health care coverage as we head into the final weeks of open enrollment,” California Assocation of Health Plans’ Chief Executive Patrick Johnston said in a statement.###3883||The successful IPO of Twitter in November and a surge in Facebook’s share price have fuelled speculation a string of technology firms could come to market, including music-sharing service Spotify, lodging service AirBnB, and payments company Square.

King should also get a boost in its US initial public offering from a surge in shares of digital coupon firm Coupons.com after it went public on Friday. Shares of Coupons. com doubled after being priced above the firm’s planned IPO range.

King Digital said it expected to price its IPO of 22.2m shares at between $21 and $24 per share. At the top of this range, the company would be valued at about $7.6bn.

The offering is scheduled to be priced on March 25 and the stock will start trading on March 26.

The Dublin-based firm will sell 15.5m shares in the offering, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7m shares, the company said yesterday in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

King is hoping to benefit from a shift towards mobile platforms, social networks, and app stores. The company derived 73% of gross bookings from mobile users in the fourth quarter ended December 31.

In February, an average of 144m daily active users played the firms’s games more than 1.4 billion times per day, the filing showed.

The King IPO will raise as much as $532.8m at the top-end of the planned range.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2% of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing. CEO Riccardo Zacconi, who has led the firm since it was founded in 2003 in Sweden, will have a 9.5% stake.

Candy Crush Saga, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same colour, was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and the year’s top revenue-grossing app.

It has been downloaded more than 500m times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra lives.

King offers 180 games in 14 languages through mobile phones, Facebook, and its own website, but is heavily reliant on Candy Crush, which brings in about three-quarters of its revenues.

The company said it has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KING”.

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the public offering.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amid all the news about GM's big recall for ignition switch problems, there's one fact that many may have missed: None of the affected cars have actually been fixed yet.

GM has sent letters to the owners of vehicles from model years 2005 through 2007 involved in the massive recall alerting them of the problem. But owners haven't been asked to bring their cars in for repairs, yet, because there aren't enough parts to fix all the cars.

It's not unusual for an auto recall to take some time to get started, especially when large numbers of replacement parts are needed. In this case, GM dealers need 1.4 million new ignition switches. Once those parts are ready, owners will be asked to bring in their cars. GM says that should be some time in the beginning of April.

Owners will be asked to contact their local dealership to arrange a time for their car to be repaired. GM says the repair job should take less than hour of actual work to perform but could take longer than that, depending on how busy things are in the service department.

To make amends for the inconvenience, GM is offering owners a $500 discount on the purchase of a new GM car. Dealers can also lend new cars to owners inconvenienced by the recall, GM said in a statement.

As with all recalls, the work will be done at no cost to the owner.

The cars involved in the recall are the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Saturn Sky and Ion and the Pontiac G5 and Solstice.

In some of those cars, the key can too easily be knocked out of the "Run" position and back into either "Accessory" or "Off" even when the car is being driven. That's why GM's recall letter advises owners to have nothing whatsoever attached to the car key, not other keys and not even the key fob that came with it. Any added weight hanging from the key increases the chances that the key can be bumped out of position.

At least 13 deaths have been attributed to this happening.

GM acknowledges that it knew of this problem for 10 years, all the way back to the time these models were first introduced but, for various reasons, a recall wasn't ordered until recently. This recall is now the subject of investigations by Congress, the Justice Department and by GM itself.###3885||Empty###3886||At some U.S. lenders we observed downticks in mortgage rates on Tuesday, erasing those losses interest rates had following the release of the employment report last Friday.

Investing.com - The pound slipped against the dollar on Tuesday after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said earlier he saw room for the monetary authority to leave rates on hold for longer.

In U.S. trading on Tuesday, GBP/USD was trading at 1.6629, down 0.09%, up from a session low of 1.6597 and off a high of 1.6654.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6584, the low from Feb. 24, and resistance at 1.6742, Monday's high.

Speaking before parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, Carney said the amount of spare capacity in the economy was probably slightly higher than 1.5% of gross domestic product, indicating that the economic recovery can continue without pushing up inflation.

He added that there was a range of views among the bank's monetary policy committee members on the amount of spare capacity in the economy.

Carney also reiterated that when rate increases do come they will be gradual.

Earlier Tuesday, data showed that U.K. manufacturing output rose more than expected in January, but bad weather hampered the broader measure of industrial output.

Manufacturing production rose 0.4% in January, the Office for National Statistics reported, above expectations for a 0.3% gain, while December's figure was revised up to a 0.4% increase from a previously reported gain of 0.3%.

On a year-over-year basis, manufacturing production rose 3.3%, up from 1.4% in December.

Industrial output rose 0.1% in January, slowing sharply after a 0.5% increase in December and was up 2.9% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected industrial output to rise 0.2% in January.

Sterling was flat against the euro, with EUR/GBP up 0.02% at 0.8338, and down against the yen, with GBP/JPY down 0.15% as 171.63.

On Wednesday, the U.K. is to produce data on the trade balance.###3890||Vodafone is flush with cash after the Verizon sale, and the Vittorio Colao, the firm’s chief executive, has previously expressed…

The share price of Vodafone (LSE: VOD) (NASDAQ: VOD.US) rose a little under 1% to 224p during early trade this morning, after the telecoms operator acquired the Spanish firm Ono for £6bn.

The deal will see the UK company further advance into the “unified” communications market in Europe, with Ono described as Spain’s leading provider of broadband, pay-TV and fixed communications.

Ono has nearly 2 million customers and the acquisition values it at 7.5 times earnings.

Vodafone is flush with cash after the Verizon sale, and the Vittorio Colao, the firm’s chief executive, has previously expressed that he is looking at acquisitions that could “transform” the company.

He added this morning:

“The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market. We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain”.

Vodafone is struggling in Europe at the moment, reporting a 10% decline in European revenue for the three months ended 31 December.

Analysts expect Vodafone’s upcoming annual results to reveal earnings per share of 17p in support of a dividend equivalent to 10p per share.

Therefore, at the current share price, Vodafone trades on a price/earnings ratio of 14 and offers a possible income of 4.5%.

Of course, the decision to ‘buy’ — taking into Vodafone’s acquisition strategy and its potential to turn things around in Europe, as well as the wider prospects for the telecoms industry — remains your decision.###3891||Empty###3892||Empty###3893||Empty###3894||China deployed 21 satellites to scour its territory for a missing Malaysian jetliner, while Australia said it had drastically narrowed its sector of the search area but was still looking in an expanse of ocean the size of Spain and Portugal.

According to an unnamed source who is familiar with the probe, Herbalife was said to have been surprised with the commission's decision to investigate the company but decided that the outcome of the probe could silence critics about the company's business model. CNBC said that the commission probe is expected to last a minimum of a year.

Following FTC's opening of the probe, Herbalife released a statement, which read, "Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace."

On the same day, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman claimed that the nutrition company had broken direct-selling laws in China. Herbalife is said to be doing well in the mainland, which is its fastest-growing market.

When asked by CNBC about their comments about the FTC probe, Ackman and his firm Pershing Square refused to provide any. FTC on the other hand, acknowledged that it did launched a probe on Herbalife, but refused to provide additional details to the news outlet.

The news about the probe had an effect on investors, and Herbalife saw its shares diving to as much as 15% after halting temporarily. The company ended the day with a 7.3% decrease in share price. Its rival Nu Skin, on the other hand, saw the trading of its shares halted temporarily by a circuit breaker due to volatility, CNBC said.

Chief market analyst Andrew Wilkinson at Interactive Brokers wrote which could have been the genera reaction of investors in the options market, "The level of implied volatility surged from 50 percent to 99 percent with the downside range expanding from $50 by next week's expiration down to $30.

The numbers in Tampa Bay are up as well, with the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) closing last year with about 14.5 million rides.

"That was up about three percent from the year before," PSTA CEO Brad Miller said.

Miller was in Washington D.C. Monday, asking Congress to invest more in public transportation. He says people are looking for different ways to get around.

"The younger generations are riding transit more and driving less and in Pinellas County we're definitely looking to the future at that," he said.

Public transit advocates in Pinellas County are hoping to implement the Greenlight Pinellas Plan if a proposed 1 percent sales tax referendum passes in the November elections. The plan includes a 65 percent increase in bus service options and a start-up for light rail.###3897||* Decline in Chinese exports weighs on commodity currencies

* Copper hits eight-month low

* Mining stocks hit by Chinese trade data

* Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor concern

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes slipped and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 percent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.

Prices on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 percent. The Chinese data also provided some support to gold.

Chinese gloom added to strain in emerging markets, compounding worries the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

The data hit commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars , both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the exports plunge.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor unease. In Crimea, unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.

Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.

In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.04 points or 0.21 percent, to 16,418.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.87 points or 0.05 percent, to 1,877.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.775 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,334.448.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.5 percent to $31.38 as the China data sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.1 percent.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 percent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.4 percent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.2 percent.

German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3 percent, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in the world’s top commodity buyer.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.

On Wall Street, Boeing Co shares lost 1.3 percent to $126.89 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.

Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.3 percent at $23.09. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations.

CHINESE DATA WEIGHS ON AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR

The Aussie last traded 0.6 percent weaker at $0.9017 , while the loonie bounced back at C$1.1101 after hitting a low of C$1.1073 in Asian trading.

The Australian dollar had been tracking higher towards the end of last week, boosted by signs of improvement in its own economy. But like fellow commodity producer Canada, it depends heavily on China extending a decade of robust expansion.

Authorities in Beijing continued a campaign to halt any further appreciation of the yuan by setting its daily guidance for the currency at the highest since mid-December.

The U.S. dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that U.S. job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was up 0.06 percent at 79.767.

In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.

Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels.

The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude fell 92 cents to settle at $108.08. U.S. oil dropped $1.246 to $101.12 a barrel.

Gold prices were little changed, though disappointing data helped underpin the market.

Spot gold inched down 5 cents to $1,339.80 an ounce.

Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than $20 at the beginning of the year.###3898||

According to a statement by the company, the management and the union have been discussing the charter of demands for 2013-14 for the past 10 months.

“On the instigation of the union, certain employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line and have been threatening supervisors, thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days. All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lockout notice,” the company said.

Additional Labour Commissioner J T Jinkalappa said, “The workers were demanding a `4,000 pm hike. For over two months, a two-hour strike every day dented production. Both the union and management will be called on Monday to settle the dispute.”

A senior officer from Bidadi police station told Express that there will be security around the factory to prevent any untoward incidents.

The Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) plants at Bidadi, located on the outskirts of Bangalore, employ over 6,400 people.

The company produces their flagship Innova models and Fortuner in the first plant while it has been rolling out Corolla Altis, Etios, Etios Liva and Camry from the second plant.###3900||While investigators are stumped over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, the lack of evidence as to what happened hasn’t stopped wild – and I mean WILD – speculation as to the fate of the missing jet and its 239 passengers and crew members.

It’s not unusual for mysterious or dramatic aviation accidents to catch the imaginations of the conspiratorially inclined - the Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Pan Am Flight 103, and TWA Flight 800 tragedies spurred all kinds of claims of conspiracy, and last week’s apparent tragedy in the Gulf of Thailand is no different.

Conspiracy theorists took to social media this week to contribute their own ideas as to why Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared.

1. Aliens are involved: Alexandra Bruce at ForbiddenKnowledgeTV points to records on the flight mapping website Flightradar24 as evidence of extra-terrestrial meddling. She goes so far as to say the “captured signals” could “only be termed a UFO.”

Her source? YouTube user DAHBOO77, who posted a video that attempts to recreate the plane’s last moments. The clip shows a quick-moving plane and other strange anomalies around the time of the MH370’s disappearance from radar.

Loading the logs directly on the site allows readers to easily click and identify the so-called “UFO,” which is clearly marked as Korean Airlines Flight 672. Its apparent supersonic speed is likely related to a glitch in the system, not alien intervention, according to the site’s CEO Mikael Robertsson.

“[Some] receivers do not provide the same data quality, so sometimes parts of the data can be corrupt [and] generate errors like the one you see on the video,” he explained. “For example if Longitude received is 120 instead of 110, that would generate such error.”

2. The passengers are still alive: Families awaiting news about lost loved ones have told reporters they are able to call the cell phones of their missing relatives, and have said they can also see their instant messaging service accounts remain active online.

The news has fueled all kinds of speculation, but phones that are turned off do not always necessarily go straight to voicemail. Factors such as location, the phone’s network type and its proximity to a cell phone tower can all affect whether a dead phone will still ring on the caller’s end.

You can test this for yourself: turn off your cell phone, remove the battery and call your number on another line - most kinds of phones will still ring before you reach voicemail.

3. There's a Snowden connection: Reddit user Dark_Spectre posted an unusual theory on the website’s conspiracy boards, related to 20 employees of the Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor who were reportedly on the flight:

“So we have the American IBM Technical Storage Executive for Malaysia, a man working in mass storage aggregation for the company implicated by the Snowden papers for providing their services to assist the National Security Agency in surveilling the Chinese.. And now this bunch of US chip guys working for a global leader in embedded processing solutions (embedded smart phone tech and defense contracting) all together..on a plane..And disappeared.. Coincidence??”

Dark_Spectre goes as far as to suggest those chip experts may have been kidnapped by Chinese or American authorities:



"Perhaps a little fast and furious dive under the radar to a flat water landing to rendezvous with a Chinese ship or sub for transport to a black-site for advanced interrogation, scuttling the plane along with the remaining passengers.(any oceanic trenches in fuel capacity distance?) What would 200 lives be to the Chinese intelligence community for the chance to find out ‘exactly’ the depth and scope of our intrusion.”

Yeah, because that would definitely be the easiest way of doing that.

“US intelligence got late wind that their flying brain-trust of 21 were going to be arrested/detained and interrogated upon landing in China and the US intelligence community deemed the risk too great to their Asian based espionage programs and took appropriate action to "sanitize" the plane in flight.”

So far, there is no evidence of an explosion.

4. Iranians kidnapped engineers: UFO Digest’s Tony Elliott points to revelations that an Iranian national was responsible for buying plane tickets for two passengers with stolen passports as evidence that the country was involved, possibly to extract technological intelligence from Freescale Semiconductor employees.

“If the plane is not found in the next few days, or ever, we must assume the plane was hijacked and taken to a nearby country where that government wants to keep the disappearance a secret,” he wrote. “If this is the case, the two passengers with stolen passports must be the hijackers.”

Elliott concludes that the plane is in East Timor, due to an apparent u-turn made by the plane in its final moments on radar.

“If the Iranian government wanted to hijack the plane, it would have had its hijackers make an abrupt turn and head to the nearest friendly Muslim country,” he wrote. “In this case, it would be East Timor, the most likely country, located in the opposite direction from the flight path.”

The theory doesn’t address why the plane suddenly disappeared from radar entirely - no passenger plane could drop from 36,000 feet to below radar horizon in mere seconds.

5. Passengers were taken to Pyongyang: This map is slightly deceptive - while the trip to both Beijing and Pyongyang appear equidistant, this theory would require the plane fly at extremely low altitudes to avoid radar detection, which - due to greater air density at lower altitudes - would require more fuel to travel the same distance.

6. The Illuminati is involved: “Was looking at the Wikipedia page for the missing Malaysia Airlines, and noticed that it's was [sic] the 404th 777 Boeing produced,” Redditor i-am-SHER-locked wrote.

“An HTTP 404 error mean [sic] not found, which in this case is oddly approiate [sic] for the status of the aircraft, or just a concidence [sic]. Coincidence, i think not!”

I think, probably.

7. There's a new Bermuda triangle: Though the Bermuda Triangle’s status as one of the sea’s most mysteriously treacherous zones has been debunked for decades, it doesn’t stop some from seeing triangles in the Gulf of Thailand.

Just look at this. coincidence? "@genosarkies: after 3days and stll no sign of MH370? did the bermuda triangle move?” pic.twitter.com/5ab2ZFR0In — Bow to the king! (@KingLionsXII) March 10, 2014

8. The plane is in Vietnam, where it is waiting to be used as a weapon: “Conspiracy and prophecy in the news” blogger ShantiUniverse said she has three possible theories about what happened to Flight MH370: A major mechanical error (OK), a terrorist attack (reasonable) or it was whisked away to a secret Vietnamese airport to be used in a later 9/11 style attack (...).

“Flight 370 was last contacted by another unnamed pilot 10 minutes after losing initial contact,” she writes. “He claims the plane was deep into Vietnam airspace. Its [sic] possible it was hijacked and forced to land at another airport, where passengers are being held hostage. There is a long list of former airports and proposed airports in Vietnam. Its also possible since the plane had no contact, it could of [sic] managed to get to Cambodia to a former or proposed airport...Why would terrorist want a plane intact? Though this is highly unlikely, but not impossible, the only reason I can think of is they would want the plane to use as a weapon of mass destruction like on the September 11 attacks.”

Right.

9: There was some kind of miniature hydrogen bomb controlled by an iPhone app and it created a miniature black hole: It’s hard to tell whether @Angela_Stalcup’s account is the work of a completely unhinged lunatic or a genius, masterful troll. Wading through claims that Donald Trump runs a prostitution ring through Trump University or that Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of 92 clones of Adolf Hitler, you may stumble upon this gem of a theory about Flight MH370:

The Malaysia Airlines Jet was blown up by a micro nuclear bomb which created a black hole of magnetic forces vaporizing the whole jetliner. — Angela Stalcup (@Angela_Stalcup) March 10, 2014

So what really happened?: The truth is, no one really knows. The AP now cites a senior Malaysian military official who reports the country has radar data detecting the plane in the Malacca Strait - hundreds of miles from the last position recorded by civilian authorities.

*Armchair conspiracy theorists have also speculated (on Twitter, of course) that the passengers on flight 370 have landed on a remote, impossible-to-find island a la "Lost."

NPR offers some more level-headed theories about the plane’s fate here.

The compact, which passed the Alabama Legislature last year, would allow participating states to use federal funding that currently goes to health care programs such as Medicare however they see fit.

Federal funding that is spent on military, veteran and native American health care would be exempt, as would funding for programs run by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. States would assume authority over all other federal funding that is spent on health care.

“In member states, states can suspend federal health care regulations,” the national organization backing the effort says on its website.

The compact was conceived by Competitive Governance Alliance, a Texas-based conservative 501(C)(4) organization that champions small government, and a bill that would approve it was introduced in Congress last month by U.S. Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma.

In an essay written for Forbes magazine, Lankford says that the troubled rollout of the federal government's Affordable Care Act website, and the relatively smooth rollout of state exchange websites, is evidence that the states should be managing the governance of health care.

"Local control works better," Lankford wrote. "The states are listening to the people. It's time for Congress to do the same."

States whose legislatures have voted to participate are Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Indiana. The Kansas legislature is debating the issue, according to a report from the KU Statehouse Wire Service.

The compact would be unenforceable without Congressional approval.###3906||###3907||Mark Carney doesn’t obviously share many characteristics with Mervyn (now Lord) King. But one thing Mr Carney does seem to have inherited from his predecessor as Governor of the Bank of England is a belief that the UK economy is still far too weak to tolerate any withdrawal of extraordinary monetary support, and will remain that way for some time.

Right up to his last days at the Bank of England, Lord King was a supporter of the need for more quantitative easing. In place of asset purchases, Mr Carney has substituted “forward guidance”, but the thinking behind the two approaches is much the same. Both are founded on the idea that there is still lots of spare capacity in the economy left behind by the recession; to compensate, the Bank of England has to keep its foot full down on the monetary accelerator.

This message came across loud and clear in Mr Carney’s marathon appearance on before the Commons Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday. Judging by what he said, Mr Carney remains overtly dovish in his approach to monetary policy.

He’s said this before, of course, but he said it even more strongly at Tuesday’s hearing; the point at which interest rates will need to start rising to keep inflation low is still some distance off, and when they do rise, it will only be gradually and to a level which is considerably lower than the pre-crisis norm. Mr Carney has insisted that he is not a believer in the again fashionable idea of “secular stagnation” – the belief that many Western economies have sunk into a near-permanent state of impaired demand – but his comments often seem to place him in that camp.

For instance, it was very apparent from his musings that he believes there to be much more slack in the economy than his Monetary Policy Committee colleague Martin Weale, who at Tuesday’s hearing challenged some of the assumptions behind the idea of endemic “underemployment”.

What does all this mean for the astonishing series of monetary reponses we’ve seen over the past five years to the financial crisis? One intriguing suggestion by Mr Carney is that the Bank of England’s balance sheet, swollen under quantitative easing by £375bn of asset purchases, will remain permanently bigger. So does this mean that at least some of the QE will never be unwound? Many of us have long suspected that this is in practice what will occur, that effectively some part of the national debt has been permanently monetised.

But this is not really what Mr Carney meant. Indeed, he has repeatedly rejected the idea of monetary financing of government spending, a very slippery path if ever there was one. His point was rather that private banks, badly scarred by recent experience, may well choose to keep more of their deposits as central bank reserves as QE is unwound, with the consequence that the Bank of England ends up with a much bigger balance sheet than it had before the crisis.

To all intents and purposes, it will therefore look as if the Bank of England has failed to unwind some of the QE, but in fact it will be merely a change in the way banks manage their liquidity. Follow? Oh, never mind; the wider, more simplistic point is this: Fiat currencies are routinely the subject of government and central bank manipulation. We can only hope that the technocrats who perform this function know what they are doing. As is apparent in the tendency of some economies to hyper-inflation and catastrophic loss of market confidence, quite often they don’t.

In any case, the idea behind much modern monetary policy is that inflation is controlled not so much by targeting the quantity of money, as by influencing demand for money through its costs. Increase interest rates, and demand for money decreases; lowering rates should theoretically cause demand for money to rise. Mr Carney believes that such demand in the UK economy is still structurally deficient. My worry it is that it is already very much apparent in fast inflating asset prices, or in other words that ultra loose monetary policy is already sowing the seeds for future financial crises. We will see.###3908||Fed Chair Yellen to stick to game plan on taperin

WASHINGTON - Agence France-Presse

New Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen is expected to stick to the game plan when she chairs her first monetary policy meeting this week, further cutting back economic stimulus.But, six weeks after inheriting Ben Bernanke’s mantle, she is also under the gun to make a pivot in the way the Fed has been signaling its intentions. Handled well, that delicate shift in how the Fed foreshadows an eventual rate hike could assuage markets. But communicated badly, it could result in volatile movements and leave the new Fed chief on the back foot.The first meeting under Yellen’s lead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), on March 18-19, is expected to conclude that unusually harsh winter storms were mainly behind the slowdown in economic activity in December to February. Despite a series of weak job creation numbers, slow construction activity and slow retail sales since December, most analysts expect the FOMC won’t pause in the drawdown of its bond buying program, its huge easy-money the stimulus effort.The Fed has cut the program by $20 billion to $65 billion a month since the beginning of the year, and another $10 billion cut could be decided this week. Yellen already showed her bias toward the weather explanation when she testified to the U.S. Senate on Feb. 27.Taking note of the poor data, she said she “wouldn’t want to jump to conclusions.”However, she added, “It is clear that unseasonably cold weather has played some role.” A week later, the Fed Beige Book survey of regional economies, important content for the FOMC policy meeting, mentioned the weather 119 times in explaining sluggish activity in much of the country.A modest rebound in retail sales data in February suggested that there is some pent-up demand, and analysts hope this month and next will show a rebound in the economy. “We expect catch-up in March, leading to good momentum heading in to the second quarter,” said Jim O’Sullivan at High Frequency Economics. Yellen, who has always stayed behind the scenes during her three years as Bernanke’s deputy, will face the media on March 19 when she announces the FOMC’s policy decision.With the bond-buying taper expected to remain on track, the challenge will be to explain how the FOMC will adjust the communication of its expectations: essentially, how it signals to the market when it plans to begin raising its key interest rate, held at a rock-bottom 0-0.25 percent since December 2008.At the end of 2012, the FOMC set specific thresholds for when it could begin lifting the rate: 2.0 percent for inflation and a 6.5 percent unemployment rate. Most policymakers did not think those levels would be breached until 2015, and the current Fed outlook for a rate hike is later next year.Inflation is still very low, but the unemployment rate has fallen faster than expected, now at 6.7 percent, and is bumping against the threshold. Yellen and other Fed officials say that does not reflect real problems in the jobs market, including high part-time work, a large number of market dropouts and a large number of long-term unemployed.For that reason, said Deutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna, the FOMC is likely to change its forward guidance “by switching from a quantitative to qualitative approach, meaning the number thresholds on the unemployment rate and inflation will be abandoned.”###3909||The consensus view had been for a rise to a plus or minus 2% from the previous 1% band and this has now been initiated; the interesting development is the timing of the announcement.

Most had expected the bank to enact this reform in the coming months, not this soon in the piece. It is no coincidence that the PBoC has stepped in when the spot CNY moved back above the fixing rate after several weeks of defying the previous trend. The PBoC is obviously acutely aware of the speculative USD selling here, as it has explicitly stated in the press that it will step in when (not if) necessary.

That means it will still moderate hot money outflows; the trade of the last few years had seen hot money inflows (mainly in USDs) which were used for lending, collateral or funding sources. These loan funds were then used for a wealth creation purposes by placing the loan funds into wealth products such as corporate bonds etc., or other speculation products. At the same time the CNY was appreciating; so on redemption the trade was boosted by currency appreciation.

This has since broken down as we saw the first major corporate bond default a week ago, with Premier Li Kequang stating at the close of the People’s Nation Congress that further defaults were ‘unavoidable’. This has heightened credit crunch fears and seen hot money exiting, which caused the spot CNY to drop below the fixing. With the rate reversing at the back-end of last week, it has given the PBoC a chance to step further towards liberalisation; something that will be long-term supportive.

This is more supportive because it creates efficiency in capital allocation, increases flexibility and push economic restructuring, and should see the CNY becoming more market determined. It allows increased hedge to risk and increases it flexibly to react to market issues.

Form an Asian-centric point of view this will have a longer-term effect on trade; it provides fairer trade boundaries as products and services move towards ‘fair value’ on a country to country basis. We see possible short-term volatility judging by the reactions to the widen of the band to 1%, however it is still very low on international standards and is unlikely to have a major effect; with the PBoC as a backstop it may strengthen and could fly on the open.

Crimea – priced in?

What has also eventuated over the weekend is the referendum vote in Crimea; as widely expected Crimea has voted to annex itself from Ukraine and join Moscow, this news I believe is priced in and the futures markets looks unaffected by the news from overnight. As expected, the West has dismissed the vote and does not recognise the referendum; with 95.5% of Crimeans voting to join Russia it is not surprising it has been dismissed.

What will be market-sensitive is if the West increases financial sanction on Russia, that is where the change will be felt. So far the West looks toothless to act as the reaction from Russia looks to be stronger and swifter on European assets particularly, and this will likely pressure Europe not to act financially, but rather diplomatically. The political reaction over the coming days will be telling for market reactions.

Ahead of the Australian open

We are currently calling the [AU200|ASX 200] down 24 points on the 10am bell (AEDT) to 5305 based on the futures close from Saturday which is likely to change on the open. The copper continues to see selling as the pendants ask ‘has it bottomed?’

The falling knife that is copper is very hard to judge as the amount of copper that has been used as collateral in China is likely to distort trading. Copper looks to be under downward pressure and that hasn’t reversed yet. Again copper equities and commodity currencies are likely to see pressure.###3910||Wall Street closes mixed

United States stocks have finished mixed as cautious investors kept an eye on the Ukraine crisis and awaited more information on the direction of the economy.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 11.17 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 16,340.08.

"Investors are cautious.... as global economic and geopolitical concerns cast a shadow on Wall Street," a market note from Wells Fargo Advisors said.

"Specifically, uncertainty over upcoming Chinese economic data and tensions between Russia and the Ukraine are weighing on stocks."

"The two headlines stories driving the market are China and perhaps still some thought about what is going on in Ukraine," David Levy of Kenjol Capital Management said, echoing the concern about whether China is still slowing down.

But Mr Levy noted that US markets still appear to have a firm floor in them, after the S&P 500 hit a fresh record last week.

"Lately any time we have the slightest pullback, we can't seem to pull the string together for multiple down days. It continues to show the strength of the market," he said.

Furious about your Mt. Gox losses? You’ll have to cool your heels.

U.S. legal actions against Mt. Gox — notably a lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court that sought class-action status — are on temporary hold after the bitcoin exchange submitted a bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday.

Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection, designed for cases where the parties are based in multiple countries. The Tokyo company, once the world’s largest bitcoin trading post, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28.

At the time it said 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox bitcoins were missing, meaning a cool $450 million had gone up in smoke.

The U.S. bankruptcy eventually could benefit stranded investors, giving the U.S. a structure to work with other countries to track down any remaining assets.

Over the weekend, furious bitcoin users hacked the website of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, posting data that appears to show that the exchange still holds customer investments in the millions of dollars.

“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities’ wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” an anonymous hacker wrote.

So on the downside, Mt. Gox has imploded. On the upside, it’s vaulted into the echelons of companies whose names became common verbs. Of course, being synonymous with total flakiness is not something most CEOs aspire to.

Believe it or not, getting “goxed” first showed up in Urban Dictionary almost three years ago after a spate of Mt. Gox closures and trading delays, but it’s caught fire in the past couple of weeks.

Carolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.###3916||WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Justice Department has started a preliminary investigation into how General Motors handled the recall of 1.6 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches linked to at least 12 deaths.

The inquiry is focusing on whether GM might have violated criminal or civil laws by failing to notify regulators in a timely fashion about the switch failures, said a person familiar with the probe, who asked not to be named and isn’t authorized to discuss investigations.

Lawyers in the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York are leading the investigation.

Meanwhile, GM has lowered the number of deaths linked to one of the models covered by the recall to four from five.

In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted Tuesday evening on the agency's Web site, GM said that a front-seat passenger killed in a Saturn Ion crash had been counted twice because two reports about the accident had been filed.​ That reduces the number of deaths tied to the defective switches to 12 from 13, a GM spokesman said.

The criminal probe of GM opened by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara follows an investigation conducted by the same office into Toyota Motor Corp.'s disclosure in 2009 of driver complaints of unintended acceleration in some of its vehicles.

Toyota has been engaged in negotiations with Bharara's office to settle that probe, which is also criminal, a source familiar with the investigation previously told Reuters.

Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the GM investigation. GM also declined to comment on the department's probe.

The inquiry comes as House and Senate committees and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are also investigating GM’s actions leading up to the recall.

While the immediate financial impact of the recall is “insignificant,” some hard-to-quantify risk to GM's reputation is emerging, Joseph Spak, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to investors on Tuesday.

"Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM," he said.

“Remember while this was old (pre-bankruptcy) GM, the consumer won’t differentiate,” Spak said. “It does appear that GM employees have known about the risk for a while, so it does seem there is a failure to act somewhere along the way.”

GM shares tumbled 5.2 percent to close at $35.18 in New York trading on Tuesday, its worst one-day drop at the close since March 2012.

House committee letters

As part of a Congressional probe, a House committee sent a letter to GM, addressed to CEO Mary Barra, and another letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, on Monday, requesting extensive records tied to the recall.

The letters, signed by Republican and Democratic leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee, called for all records of consumer complaints, field reports and reports of death, injury or property damage.

The committee also said it wanted “a detailed timeline of interactions and communications between GM and NHTSA related to stalls, air bags and/or ignition switches in the GM vehicles subject to recall.”

The letters gave the agency and the company until March 25 to reply.

The initial recall on Feb. 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s. It was expanded less than two weeks later to more than 800,000 additional vehicles. Those include 2003-2007 Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstices and 2006-2007 Saturn Skys. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.

27-page order

NHTSA, whose decision not to investigate the switch failures years ago is also under scrutiny by Congress, is focusing on what steps the automaker took to investigate and rectify engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating back to at least 2004.

GM has until April 3 to answer questions posed by the regulator in a 27-page order issued last week. The recall is emerging as the first major test for Barra, who was promoted to CEO two weeks before the company decided Jan. 31 to implement the recall.

Heavy key rings or jarring can cause the ignition switches to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags, GM says. The automaker has linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including 12 deaths.

GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.

NHTSA could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the U.S. government, if it finds the automaker didn’t pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective.

The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc, said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker. Delphi is a former auto parts unit of GM.

“It’s a survival of the fittest,” Bob Goldin, executive vice president at Chicago-based restaurant researcher Technomic Inc., said in a phone interview before today’s filing. “The market is not growing, or it’s barely growing, so the weak players are getting weeded out.”

Competition among U.S. restaurants has been increasing as newer fast-casual chains expand quickly. Sbarro filed for bankruptcy on March 10, while the owner of Hot Dog on a Stick filed last month, as foot traffic in shopping malls dwindled and chains such as Panera Bread Co., Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Subway Restaurants cut into their business.

Quiznos listed debt of more than US$500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. It’s seeking to implement a plan that it said would cut debt by US$400 million. Senior lenders “overwhelmingly” support the plan and the chain will continue operations during reorganization, according to a company statement.

‘Accelerated’ Emergence

The company said it will seek court approval of a US$15 million loan from its senior lenders to continue operations as it restructures. It said business won’t be interrupted and obligations to customers and workers will be met. The company expects to execute its restructuring plan and emerge from bankruptcy on an “accelerated basis,” according to the statement.

U.S. Bank NA, as agent under a second-lien credit agreement, is owed US$173.8 million plus interest, according to court papers, making it the largest creditor whose debt is unsecured by collateral. Trade creditors include bakeries and Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN.

In 2012, Quiznos underwent an out-of-court financial restructuring that eliminated about US$300 million in debt and gave majority ownership to billionaire Marc Lasry’s Avenue Capital Group LLC through a US$150 million equity infusion and debt-to-equity swap.

Quiznos, founded in 1981, operates restaurants in all 50 states and 34 countries, according to its website. It has about 2,100 stores, all but seven of them franchised, according to today’s statement.

New Menu

The chain sells toasted sub-style sandwiches and recently added pasta dishes, such as chicken pesto and macaroni and cheese with bacon, to its menu.

“They expanded too fast, they had a weak franchisee network,” Goldin said. “Once the Paneras of the world came along, I think, many consumers thought that was a better quality price point. And Subway came in on the lower end and aggressively promoted themselves as fresh.”

Quiznos Chief Executive Officer Stuart K. Mathis said in today’s statement that the company plans to cut food costs, make loans available to some franchisees for improvements and invest in advertising, as well as add technology to boost efficiency.

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group plans to go public on a U.S. stock exchange, possibly raising up to $15 billion in the biggest initial public offering since Facebook.

The announcement on Sunday confirming plans for a US share sale ended months of speculation over where the company would list after talks for an initial public offering in Hong Kong fell apart last year.

Alibaba is one of the world’s biggest internet companies and says more than $150bn worth of merchandise changes hands on its online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay combined.

The company began as a service to link Chinese suppliers with retailers abroad and has branched out into retail e-commerce. It is little known abroad but has launched two consumer-oriented services in the United States.

“Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,” the company said in a statement. “This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.”

It gave no details of the timing or size of the initial public offering or on which exchange it would take place.

Analysts have estimated that an Alibaba IPO could raise up to $15bn and value the company at more than $100bn. Facebook’s IPO in June last year raised $16bn and at the time valued the company at more than $100bn.

Alibaba is one of a number of Chinese internet heavyweights planning to cash in with IPOs amid rapid growth. The announcement comes two days after Chinese internet company Sina’s Weibo microblog unit filed plans for a possible share sale in the US.

The figures, which the Colorado Department of Revenue said were in line with expectations, add to just over $1.4 million collected in taxes and fees on medical marijuana in the state in the same month.

The figures for recreational marijuana include revenues from a 2.9 percent sales tax, a special 10 percent tax on retail pot sales and a 15 percent excise tax imposed on growers, as well as licensing fees, the department said in a statement.

The numbers indicate the state’s recreational pot stores did about $14 million in gross sales for the month.

“We expect clear patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts,” said Barbara Pohl, executive director of the department.

Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the possession and use of small amounts recreational marijuana by adults age 21 or older in 2012, even as marijuana remains an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Colorado opened its retail pot shops in January, and Washington is slated to follow suit later this year.

Under the Colorado legalization law, the first $40 million collected annually from the excise tax is earmarked for school construction and repairs.

The state legislature will decide how to spend any leftover money from marijuana taxes and fees.

Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalization of recreational cannabis, has told lawmakers he would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programs to prevent youths from using the drug.###3926||Empty###3927||FXStreet (Łódź) - Further into the testimony before the UK parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, BoE governor Mark Carney assures that his decision on the rate hike timing would not be affected by the UK general election scheduled for May 2015.

Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado on January 1

State revenue officials say $14.02 million was sold in the first month

The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes

Taxpayers say the first $40 million should go to school construction

Washington state will soon begin sales



Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold.



The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January.



Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.

Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about how to spend the windfall.

Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.

Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

"The whole world wants to belly up to this trough," said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado's budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.

Colorado's pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state's unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year's pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it's not clear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Several U.S. states have moved to legalize the sale of marijuana following Colorado

Colorado's JBC plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

"There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don't think it's going to be that simple," said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another JBC member.###3933||A bag of marijuana being prepared for sale sits next to a money jar at BotanaCare in Northglenn, Colorado Credit: Reuters

The Federal Trade Commission has opened a probe into Herbalife.

The stock, which had been halted, closed down more than 7% on Wednesday. It had fallen as much as 17% following the news.

Herbalife confirmed that they received a Civil Investigative Demand from the FTC.

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years," the company said in a statement.

A spokesperson acknowledged the existence of the investigation, but said the FTC had no further comment. A spokesperson for Pershing Square Capital Management declined to comment on the investigation.

Herbalife, a multi-level marketing firm that sells weight loss products and nutritional supplements, has been at the center of a major hedge fund battle.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, announced about 14 months ago that he is betting $1 billion that the stock will go to $0. Ackman's thesis is that the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals, particularly those from the Hispanic population.

Ackman believes that regulators, particularly the FTC, will be persuaded to shut the company down.

He was recently the subject of a critical page-one New York Times article about how he's been coordinating lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. to bring the company down.

Ackman commented on a conference call yesterday it wasn't his "favorite" article, but he thinks it will be "helpful." He thinks that regulators will have to pay attention now that it's a mainstream news story.

Herbalife has publicly refuted Ackman's allegations that they operate as a pyramid scheme.

Since Ackman revealed his short in late 2012, the stock price has surged. A number of fund managers, most notably Carl Icahn, have also piled on by going long the stock. Icahn has even said that he thinks Ackman will be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes."

The most recent estimate was that Ackman had suffered $500 million in paper losses on his bet. He's made back some of that money just now.

He has also maintained that he will continue take this short "to the end of the earth."

Just yesterday, Ackman hosted another conference call slamming Herbalife over its business practices in China. Ackman believes they are violating Chinese direct-selling laws.

One possible issue: Did GM violate a law that requires car makers to give the federal government timely notice of defects?

When Michigan Rep. Fred Upton authored the Tread Act 14 years ago, it was after certain Firestone tires on Ford Explorers caused accidents that killed nearly 300 people.



CBS News

The Tread Act gave manufacturers five days to report defects related to deaths and injuries to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They're called early warning reports.

"The law said five days, not five years, not 10 years, and we're going to find out why the law may not have worked the way that it was intended," Upton said.

General Motors confirmed to CBS News Wednesday night that it knew about the ignition switch issue in 2001, three years before previously acknowledged.

In 2005, GM issued a service bulletin to its dealers warning of ignition switches that can turn to the off or accessory position if there's a heavy key ring, or if the key is bumped. Engines in the Cobalts and other compact cars shut off and airbags don't work.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration or NHTSA had access to that information in 2005.

No recalls until 2014. Twelve deaths and 31 crashes have been linked to the defect.

The question is: Why didn't GM and NHTSA alert consumers sooner?

Joan Claybrook is the former head of NHTSA.

"The rule at NHTSA for years has been if there's a critical component of the car that fails that is enough information to start a defect investigation and probably to require a recall," Claybrook said.

"In this case, that did not happen," she said.

GM sent a letter to owners this week saying even after recalled cars are fixed - those fixes start in April - drivers should keep as little as possible on their key ring.

The San Jose Mercury News reported Saturday that Guinness Book of World Record officials say the $201 million life insurance policy is more than double the previous record set in 1990 by an unidentified “entertainment industry figure.”

A Southern California financial services company who helped put the deal together declined to identify the buyer for safety reasons.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him — or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances of the Santa Barbara-based SG LLC financial services company.

Frances said that the life insurance policy is actually two dozen policies underwritten by 19 different insurers. That’s because no one company could afford to pay the policies’ benefactors when the billionaire died.

Frances didn’t disclose the annual cost to the billionaire for the policy, but did say it was in the single millions of dollars. He said Guinness officials spent six months investigating the policy before declaring it the world record.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances’ firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder.

A spokeswoman for billionaire Elon Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors and other high-flying startups, declined to say whether he was the mystery buyer.

Frances wouldn’t disclose the billionaire’s age. Frances said the billionaire purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax.

Share###3941||* China swings to trade deficit in February, exports tumble

* China copper imports fall 30 pct in Feb vs Jan

* Bonded Shanghai copper premiums drop $20/T from late Feb (Updates with closing prices)

By Maytaal Angel

LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - London copper hit an eight-month low on Monday and Shanghai contracts dropped by their 5 percent daily limit, fanned by fears over the unwinding of copper finance deals in China after its first domestic bond default last week.

Adding to the downward pressure, China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

A further hit came from China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels, however.

“Clearly there’s an unwind of positioning in the credit markets in China, and as a result of that, copper which was being held as collateral against that credit is no longer required,” said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from i$6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest in more than four years.

ALL EYES ON COPPER FINANCING

China is the world’s top user of copper, accounting for 40 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used as collateral to raise funds, which are then loaned out in China’s shadow banking sector.

Worries that these financing deals could unravel have intensified since China recorded its first domestic bond default on Friday, when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment.

“The loan default by a small Chinese company shows that the not everything gets bailed out, and that’s enough to make people nervous. I haven’t seen for 10 years that LME goes down and Shanghai goes down even further,” Herwig Schmidt, head of sales at Triland, said.

Reflecting ample supply in China, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet. (www.shmet.com/)

Also Chinese short-term rates and the yuan fell on Monday following the surprisingly weak data on exports, fuelling expectations Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.

Elsewhere, U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.

Also curtailing risk appetite were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine.

Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

Aluminium closed at $1,775.50 a tonne from $1,764 at the close on Friday, while zinc ended at $2,040 from $2,059 and lead at $2,084 from $2,096.50.

Tin closed at $22,900 a tonne from $22,825 at the close on Friday, and nickel at $15,450 from $15,295.

The FTSE 100 snapped a six-day winning streak, falling 0.4% to 6,650 early on, as it pulled back from 6,675.03 on Wednesday – its best closing level since January 23rd.

Market analyst Craig Erlam from Alpari said that this comes after a “very good February so far” across European equity markets. This morning’s falls are “just a small correction on the path back to highs we were trading around in the middle of January”.

The lower start followed weakness on Asian and US markets overnight as investors continued to react to comments from Federal Reserve policymakers. One day after Janet Yellen’s first testimony as Fed Chair on monetary policy, St Louis Fed President James Bullard said he was “optimistic” about US growth this year and that the Fed could return to more “traditional” monetary policy given the recent drop in the unemployment rate.

Closer to home, the Bank of England’s Chief Economist Spencer Dale said that expectations for a rate hike in 2015 are “reasonable”. This follows the central bank’s Inflation Report yesterday, in which Governor Mark Carney completely revamped his forward guidance plan.

Tate & Lyle, Rolls-Royce, Lloyds and Rio provide a drag

Food and sweetener company Tate & Lyle sank sharply despite a third-quarter update that said it expects full-year profits to be broadly in line with the previous year, as Sucralose pricing pressures intensified. The company said that Sucralose prices in the next financial year will be down 15%.

Aerospace and defence group Rolls-Royce also dropped after revealing that 2014 revenue and profit is expected to be flat due to cuts in government defence spending, implying a reduction to current consensus forecasts.

Defence groups Meggit and BAE Systems were also lower after the statement.

Banking group Lloyds fell despite swinging to a statutory profit before tax of £415m during 2013, from a loss of £606m the year before. Chief executive António Horta-Osório said that the results “confirmed that the group is returning to robust health”, however analysts said that tangible net asset value for the year was below expectations.

Mining stocks were largely out of favour as metals prices declined. Rio Tinto was among the worst performers after underwhelming with a 10% increase in underlying earnings in 2013 and a 15% rise in the dividend.

Aberdeen was in the red after the asset manager was downgraded form ‘hold’ to ‘underperform’ by Jefferies.

UK oil and gas engineer AMEC was among the few risers this morning after an in-line 2013 report, in which adjusted earnings per share rose 11% despite a 3% dip in revenues. The company also announced a firm offer for Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.

Imperial Tobacco edged higher after first-quarter underlying tobacco net revenue rose 1% to £1.56bn, helped by its key Growth Brands.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (1,6452.72) was the exception still lagging its all-time high at 1,6588.25 on Dec. 31.

The S&P 500 (1,878.04) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (7,592.36) set new all-time intraday highs at 1883.57 and 7627.44 respectively on Friday.

As U.S. Treasury yields rose last week, the Dow Utility Average (514.39) lost its leadership slipping into second place year-to-date with a gain of 4.8% down from 5.7% the prior week. The 2014 leader among the averages and indices I follow is now the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) (574.39) up 7.4% on the year setting a new multiyear intraday high at 577.64 on Friday.

In this market environment there were five trades last week in the premium ValuTrader Model Portfolio advisory. The long-side of the model portfolio was reduced to 13 long positions in 7 stocks, four being components of the Dow Industrial Average. Two stocks on this week’s ValuTrader Watch List are also Dow components.

Here’s a summary of last week’s trades:

Kinross Gold was removed from the model portfolio last Monday, March 3 on a good 'til canceled (GTC) limit order to sell strength to my weekly risky level at $5.31. The open that day was $5.36 where the exit price was set for a gain of 19.1%. This proved to be a prudent exit as the stock ended the week at $4.89. This stock could not sustain gains above its 200-day simple moving average at $5.08 and its 50-day SMA is $4.78.

Cirrus Logic continues to be actively traded by my methodology. On January 28 a second position in this stock was removed from the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to sell strength to $19.67 for a gain of 7.7%. This position re-entered the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to buy weakness to my annual value level at $18.84 on March 3.

The stock still has a buy rating according to ValuEngine with a one-year price target at $20.41. This week’s value level is $18.54 with an annual pivot at $18.84, an annual pivot at $20.72 and monthly risky level at $23.41. Cirrus is above its 50-day SMA at $19.08 but below its 200-day SMA at $20.19. The weekly chart is positive with Friday’s close above its five-week modified moving average at $19.00 with its 200-week SMA at $21.46.

Our string of winning trades that go back to mid-September came to an end last week when Big Lots (BIG) and Coca Cola (KO) were removed from the model portfolio due to downgrades to hold from buy according to ValuEngine. Subscribers were sent a ValuTrader Alert via email on March 4. The two positions in Big Lots lost 3.3% and 3.4%, and the two positions in Coca Cola lost 2.4% and $2.2%.

We also learned last week that a bull market does not lift all stocks. On Thursday, March 6 we added a second position in Staples on a GTC limit order to buy weakness to my weekly value level at $11.24. Our first position ended last week with a mark-to-market loss of 21%. Staples still has a buy rating according to ValuEngine and is now 30% undervalued. This week’s value level is $10.77 with a monthly risky level at $13.79. On March 6 before the opening bell Staples reported a 10.6% quarterly decline in sales and as a result would close 225 stores. The stock gapped lower setting a new 52-week intraday low at $11.16.

At the end of last week our longs have a mark-to-market loss of 1.9% and our closed positions have a gain of 4.1% with the S&P 500 up 1.6%.

Powered by Capital Market - Live News###3954||NEW YORK — Looks like the best suitor won.

After an extended chase that included overtures on both sides, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will combine to create the nation’s fourth largest seller of men’s wear.

Men’s Wearhouse said Tuesday that it’s buying its rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers for $1.8 billion. The company will pay $65 a share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank’s most recent closing price. As part of the deal, Jos. A. Bank also said it’s terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear.

Shares of both companies rose on the news: Men’s Wearhouse’s shares were up nearly 5 percent to $57.13, while shares of Jos. A. Bank increased nearly 4 percent to $64.22.

Men’s Wearhouse has its headquarters in Houston, but has executive offices in Fremont. Jos. A. Bank is based in Hampstead, Md.

The acquisition comes after months of the two chains publicly fighting over who would acquire whom. Industry watchers had speculated that a merger was inevitable given the challenges the companies face in the increasingly competitive men’s wear landscape. With more than 1,700 U.S. stores and $3.5 billion in annual sales, the combined company’s reach in men’s clothing will fall behind only Macy’s, Kohl’s and J.C. Penney.

“Together, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth,” Doug Ewert, president and CEO of Men’s Wearhouse, said in a statement.

Jos. A. Bank made the first move in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion, just a few months after Men’s Wearhouse ousted its founder and chairman. Men’s Wearhouse shot down that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion. But after Jos. A. Bank turned down that bid, Men’s Wearhouse increased its offer to $1.6 billion, and then again to $1.78 billion.

In the middle of the back-and-forth, Jos. A. Bank said last month that it was buying the parent of Eddie Bauer, but left the door open for a deal with Men’s Wearhouse. At the time, it said if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.

By early March, Men’s Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met.

Despite, the rough courting period, both companies say they expect a smooth integration. In a joint press release, they said shareholders of both companies will benefit from about $100 million to $150 million in savings realized over three years as it streamlines its duplicative corporate function and improves its sourcing and merchandising. A spokesman for Men’s Wearhouse declined to comment on any layoffs or comment on management changes beyond what the release said: “management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations. ”

“Our board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value created,” said Robert N. Wildrick, chairman of Jos. A. Bank’s board. “The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts.”

Analysts say there’s a bright future for the combined company. The suit business, which generated $2.3 billion in revenue last year, has been relatively healthy. The business has been up 4 percent over the past three years, after being flat or down since the recession, according to market research firm NPD Group. That has been fueled by tight-fitting suits that have attracted young males.

The companies also have complementary businesses. Men’s Wearhouse, which sells men’s sportswear and suits through its 1,200 stores at its Men’s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G chains, caters to young male customers looking for their first suit. Meanwhile Jos. A. Banks focuses on a more established clientele that’s looking for a good deal at its 623 stores with promotions like “buy one suit or sport coat and get three free.”

But the industry is still competitive, and to grab men’s shopping dollars, analysts say both chains have had to compete with fierce promotions.

Stifel Nicholaus analyst Richard Jaffe said that the acquisition means that both companies can lower costs, whether it’s buying shopping bags or buying TV ads. He also noted each could borrow their expertise. He could see Jos. A. Bank selling tuxedos, for instance, or Men’s Wearhouse improving on its sportswear offerings.

“There are real cost savings and opportunities to turn around the business,” he said.

The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter.###3955||March 10 (Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. Bankruptcy in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily put U.S. legal action on hold against the Japanese company.

Keeping what works and reforming what the GOP believes doesn't work is tricky and could face an uphill battle.

First, since a new poll shows that the majority of Americans are satisfied with the way the current health care system is working, any tinkering with benefits or age requirements could set off a firestorm of protests. Second, if Republicans try to satisfy everyone, costs are likely to skyrocket, equalling or exceeding the dramatic year over year increases in premiums that have made health care a burden for business and consumers alike.

One thing Republicans are unlikely to do is risk big, controversial fixes that could jeopardize the 2014 midterm elections.

The Gallup poll released Monday shows that two thirds of Americans say they are satisfied with the health care system—the majority of whom have insurance, while a third are uninsured. Gallup also found that young people and elderly people were the most satisfied with the current healthcare system. Some 73 percent of people ages 18-30 said they were content with the system. And 80 percent of people over 65—who are eligible for Medicare—said they were also satisfied.

The new survey comes on the heels of a separate CNN-ORC International poll released last week revealing that support for the president’s health care law is rising slightly, with 39 percent of Americans now saying they support the law, compared to 35 percent in December. The poll found that 57 percent still oppose the law, down from 62 percent at the end of last year.

Both survey results are good news for the Obama administration, as more and more provisions in the new health care reform law take effect.

Meanwhile, the surveys could throw a wrench in the GOP’s campaign strategy to continue attacking Obamacare, while offering their own alternatives.

House Speaker John Boehner and other House leaders are cobbling together a bill to serve as an alternative to the law that shifts more power away from the federal government onto the states, with an emphasis on moving more people to private plans.

The proposal includes a handful of previously offered GOP ideas—including expanding the high risk insurance pools, promoting health savings accounts, inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together, The Washington Post reporters.

This is the first time Republicans in the House will offer a real comprehensive Obamacare alternative, instead of symbolically voting to repeal major provisions of the law or get rid of it entirely, as they have done more than 50 times.

The Post reports that House leaders plan to share a memo with other GOP lawmakers later this month outlining the proposal which is called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind.” The memo will also include talking points for the GOP lawmakers to explain it to voters.

“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA said in a statement.

However, some Democrats are skeptical about the proposal and believe the GOP’s proposal is only political and won’t actually fix the healthcare law.

“If they had fixes, I’d certainly consider it,” Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) told the Post. “But if they are trying to scrap it all, going back to the bad old days, it’s not going to go anywhere.”

Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate have unveiled an Obamacare alternative of their own and are watching the House closely to see how the new proposal will fare.

Authorities are checking on ground staff, crew and passengers.

Police have not received background checks on all the passengers. Police chief Inspector General Khalid Abu Bakar said they are still waiting for other countries to respond. So far nothing alarming has come from the information they have received.

Malaysian police are also examining a flight simulator belonging to one of the pilots of the missing jetliner and investigating engineers who worked on the plane, sharpening the probe into the jet's disappearance after authorities revealed it was a deliberate act.

The government said police searched the homes of both of the plane's pilots on Saturday, but did not say whether it was the first time officers had done so since the flight went missing more than a week ago with 239 people aboard en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

Officials revealed that the final words from the cockpit - "All right, good night" - were spoken to air traffic controllers after the plane's data communication system had been partially disabled. The pilots did not mention any trouble on board, suggesting they may have been misleading ground control.

Asked what the significance of this was, air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang told reporters: "This will tell you something ... because this is something not normal that the pilot would do."

Affendi said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air traffic controllers. That uncertainty also opened the possibility that someone else spoke those words, though he did not mention this scenario.



Given the expanse of land and water that might need to be searched, the wreckage of the plane might take months - or longer - to find, or might never be located. Establishing what happened with any degree of certainty will likely need key information, including cockpit voice recordings, from the plane's flight data recorders.



ACARS is used to send information about the plane's engines and other parts to the airline. Even though it was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to send out faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last "ping" was sent out at 8:11 a.m. - 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. It placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia or far into the southern Indian Ocean.

Given that the northern route the plane may have taken would take it over countries with busy airspace, most experts say the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen the southern route. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.

"If we [the plane] started to go north, I believe this aircraft would be tracked would have all kinds of curiosity about it from the various governments and military that would be flying in that area. We're talking at least the Pakistanis, the Indians, the Chinese, even the Americans would have great interest in an unidentified aircraft flying in that airspace," said Mark Rosenker, CBS News Aviation Safety Analyst and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.



Malaysian officials and aviation experts said that whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects.



While many people believe the plane has crashed, there is a very small possibility it may have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to "ping" when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.



"The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult," Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Sunday.

Malaysia has asked for help from countries in South, Central and Southeast Asia for assistance in tracing the jet by providing satellite and radar data, the government said in a statement. It said that for now, both the northern and southern routes that the plane may have taken were being treated with "equal importance."

There appeared to be some confusion over where to search as India, one of 12 countries contributing planes and vessels to the hunt, said it had stopped looking while waiting for confirmation from Malaysia on where to search.

CBS

Australia said it was sending one of its two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search to the remote islands in the Indian Ocean at Malaysia's request. The plane will search the north and west of the Cocos Islands, a remote Australian territory with an airstrip about 1200 kilometers (745 miles) southwest of Indonesia, military chief Gen. David Hurley said.



Malaysia's acting transport minister tweeted that he was in meetings to decide the "next course of action."

In the first detailed account of what happened to the plane, Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday that someone severed communications with the ground and deliberately diverted Flight 370 back over the Malay Peninsula early on March 8.

The revelations raised questions over possible lapses by Malaysian authorities, including why the air force wasn't aware that a jetliner was flying over the country. It also triggered speculation over who on the plane was involved - and what motive they might have for flying away with an aircraft carrying a 12-person crew and 227 passengers.

If the pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own volition? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit, or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then pilot the plane?

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possibilities, and to establish what happened with any degree of certainty investigators will likely need to examine information, including cockpit voice recordings, from the plane's flight data recorders should the jet be located.

The government's statement on Sunday gave few details on the police investigation into the pilots. It said police searched the homes of both the pilot and the co-pilot and were examining an elaborate flight simulator belonging to Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the 59-year-old pilot.

Zaharie, who has children, had previously posted photos online of the flight simulator he built for his home using three large computer monitors and other accessories. Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said this was not in itself cause for any suspicion.

Saying this was per normal procedure, the statement also said police were investigating engineers who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.

Najib said Saturday that investigators had a "high degree of certainty" that one of the plane's communications systems - the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS - was partially disabled before the plane reached the east coast of Malaysia. Shortly afterward, someone on board switched off the aircraft's transponder, which communicates with civilian air traffic controllers.

Malaysian officials and aviation experts said that whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting the pilots at the top of the list of possible suspects.

Najib confirmed that Malaysian air force defense radar picked up traces of the plane turning back westward, crossing over Peninsular Malaysia into the northern stretches of the Strait of Malacca. Authorities previously had said this radar data could not be verified.

The air force has yet to explain why it did not spot the plane flying over the country and respond. The search was initially focused on the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the plane severed its communication links. That search has now ended.

"One thing that does bother me greatly is the fact that unidentified aircraft could navigate back over Malaysia and out to sea without a physical or material response to that fact," said Britain-based aviation security consultant Chris Yates. "They were not watching."

Not much is known publicly about the two pilots.

Zaharie, who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981, had more than 18,000 hours of flying experience.

Co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was contemplating marriage after having just graduated to the cockpit of a Boeing 777. He has drawn scrutiny after the revelation that he and another pilot invited two female passengers to sit in the cockpit during a flight in 2011.

Neighbors and friends interviewed this week said Fariq played futsal, a modified form of soccer popular in Southeast Asia, with neighborhood youngsters, and that he paid for their sports shirts.###3962||This will appear next to all of your comments

Today, Kalypso Media announced they have secured full rights to the franchise. That means all future games and distribution rights for the entire series.

Simon Hellwig, founder and Global Managing Director of Kalypso Media Group, gives us an idea of what to expect from the franchise.

“This will include the development of a completely new games for all platforms, but also an extensive adaptation of the existing titles for contemporary technologies and platforms. We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities, and will begin speaking to potential development studios in the near future.”

A remaster of the classic Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is all but guaranteed. But I can’t wait to see what Kalypso has in store for an entirely new Commandos game. I’m crossing my fingers they tap Mimimi Productions to be the developer.

You might be wondering who Mimimi Productions are? They created the outstanding Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. Imagine Commandos-like gameplay set in Japan around the Edo period.

Here’s a review from ACG if the trailer peaks your interest.

The great thing here is that Mimimi Productions and Kalypso already have a relationship. Kalypso served as the publisher for the console versions of Shadow Tactics.

Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun shows what the genre can do today. Plus, the 400,000+ copies sold on Steam shows there is an audience for this type of game.

We’re still a ways off from seeing a new entry, but at least the IP is in the hands of a publisher who wants to make it happen.###3964||A day after Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) and Bill Ackman traded barbs yet again, the Federal Trade Commission announces that it is launching a formal inquiry into Herbalife. Trading on the company’s stock was halted at 1:18 p.m. Eastern so that the news could be announced. Officials also halted trading on Herbalife competitor Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) because of the revelation about Herbalife.

Herbalife probe officially begins

You may remember that U.S. Sen. Ed Markey sent a letter to the FTC and also the Securities and Exchange Commission recently urging that they investigate Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF). The SEC was very tight-lipped on the matter, although the FTC said they were considering his request. Now the FTC has filed a civil investigative demand against Herbalife.

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) issued this statement to ValueWalk in response to the announcement about the inquiry:

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years.”

The company said it doesn’t intend to make any more comments on the investigation “unless and until there are material developments.”

Herbalife, Nu Skin shares affected

Shares of Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) are indicated to reopen down about 10% after trading on them was halted. Shares of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) were halted about 11 minutes after Herbalife shares were halted because of extreme volatility, which officials believe is due to the news about the FTC’s investigation into Herbalife.

Today’s announcement from the FTC comes a day after Bill Ackman gave a presentation explaining why he believes Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is operating in violation of Chinese regulations governing direct sales. The nutritional supplements company maintains that it is not violating law and is not a pyramid scheme, as Ackman has claimed for over a year.###3965||Empty###3966||Empty###3967||Back in September, my family received an ObamaCare-induced health insurance death notice. We joined millions of other Americans whose individual market health plans died after Democrats lied about our ability to keep the plans and doctors we liked.

As I reported last fall, our letter from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado informed us that we could no longer keep our high-deductible PPO plan with a wide doctor network because of “changes from health care reform (also called the Affordable Care Act).” The ObamaCare engineers determined that the affordable plan we liked was “substandard,” forcing us to enter the ObamaCare health insurance exchange, purchase a severely limited HMO plan or seek some other alternative in the shrinking private marketplace.

We reluctantly took steps to sign up with the exchange, spending hours on Colorado's busted website, hours on the phone with shady reps and weeks waiting for some proof that we were, in fact, “enrolled.”

Then, a few months later, we received another letter from Anthem informing us that we could keep our current plan until November 2014. We signed a form stating that we wanted to do so and took steps to cancel our pending ObamaCare enrollment. Next, we got another letter stating that our current Anthem plan would be canceled on May 1, 2014.

Then President Obama announced by administrative fiat that we could keep our plan for another two years.

Simple question: Will our plan be canceled on May 1 or will we have it for another two years?

We called the number on our Anthem health insurance card. Nobody picked up the phone after waiting on hold for nearly an hour.

Second try: Twenty minutes on hold. Then, we were transferred to another number. Another 20-minute wait. Finally, a human being came on the line. After explaining our situation and posing our simple question, the rep put us on hold again. The eventual answer: He didn't know.

After taking special note of our lengthy correspondence file, the rep then proceeded to give us the same number we had initially contacted in the first place.

The left will blame the insurance companies, as always. But at the center of the current mess are Obama's desperate and now almost weekly Democrat face-saving decrees to “fix” a fundamentally broken government racket. Half of the nation's state insurance commissioners rejected the original “fix” for noncompliant plans last fall. Several still haven't made decisions on that first “fix,” let alone the new fixes for 2015 or 2016.

While the White House and Hollywood propagandists push aggressively for Americans to “Get Covered” and get enrolled in government-sponsored care before the March 31 open-enrollment deadline, millions of us are in bureaucratic limbo trying to get answers about the changes, the changes to the changes, and the changes to the changes to the changes to the private plans we liked and didn't want to leave in the first place.

A former ObamaCare policy adviser sheepishly concluded to The Washington Post: “I broadly view the administrative delays as a pragmatic realization that it is actually harder to do some of these things in reality than we thought when we put it down on paper.”

No kidding, genius.

* IMF’s Shafik named as new deputy governor for markets

* MPC’s Broadbent to be deputy governor for monetary policy

* BoE’s Haldane replaces Dale as chief economist

* Markets director Fisher to lose seat on MPC

By David Milliken and William Schomberg

LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Britain shook up the Bank of England on Tuesday, breaking the all-male grip at the top as it appointed two new deputy governors and a chief economist who has been highly critical of the banking industry.

The biggest single change in senior staff since the BoE gained independence in 1997 is accompanied by changes lower down which Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said were essential to wean the bank from its previous almost-exclusive focus on targeting inflation.

“With time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction,” he said in a lecture in London’s financial district. “The reductionist vision of a central bank’s role that was adopted around the world was fatally flawed.”

Carney also said the central bank needed to be more coordinated to manage “great risks” in the global economy, noting super-low interest could lead to complacency in financial markets.

The most striking of Tuesday’s changes is that International Monetary Fund official Nemat Shafik becomes deputy governor for markets and banking - the first woman in a top policy role since 2010.

Ben Broadbent, until now an external member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, will step up to become deputy governor for monetary policy.

In a third move, executive director for financial stability Andy Haldane swaps jobs with chief economist Spencer Dale.

Dale had been a favourite to become deputy governor but will lose his MPC seat from June when he takes over Haldane’s role on the Financial Policy Committee, which regulates banks.

Haldane has been unusually outspoken for a central banker, criticising banks for trying to dodge regulation and addressing anti-capitalism protesters.

The changes - made by Carney and the government - are part of an overhaul to break down barriers between the Bank’s monetary policy and bank regulation wings after the BoE was given major new supervisory powers in April.

Markets director Paul Fisher will lose his MPC seat to Shafik from Aug. 1, and will move to the bank’s regulation arm. Fisher has been under fire from lawmakers over the BoE’s handling of alleged manipulation of London’s currency market.

When asked by a reporter if there was a connection, Carney said the shake-up predated the foreign exchange scandal.

“The Bank needed a pretty major shake-up and it is certainly getting one,” said Jonathan Portes, director of Britain’s National Institute for Economic and Social Research.

Portes said the new appointments should breathe fresh life into the central bank’s macroeconomics team - which had a patchy forecasting record and was too inward-looking - and that Shafik had the right temperament to tackle market abuse.

“She’s pretty tough and at the moment you need someone who is prepared to be fairly tough with the London financial sector,” he said.

But Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board member who now works for Canadian think tank CIGI, said: “She will have some catch-up to do, because clearly banking and markets were not at the core of her responsibilities at the IMF.”

NEW DEPUTY GOVERNORS

Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, Carney had overseen the appointment of outsiders to two other top positions at the Bank.

Broadbent was formerly a senior economist at Goldman Sachs - Carney’s employer before he became a central banker. He will succeed Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June.

Broadbent has said the failure of troubled banks to lend money to more efficient firms is one of the reasons behind Britain’s weak economic productivity since the financial crisis.

Shafik - who holds Egyptian, U.S. and British nationality - has a background in development economics, working at the World Bank and as the top civil servant at Britain’s overseas aid department before becoming deputy managing director at the IMF.

She oversaw much of the IMF’s work in the turnaround programmes for Greece and Portugal, and at the World Bank helped get private money into infrastructure projects.

Shafik will be responsible for the BoE’s eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy, under which it amassed 375 billion pounds ($624 billion) of government bonds. She will also steer a review of how the bank gathers intelligence on markets.

Since taking office in July, Carney has been keen to increase the number of women in senior roles at the BoE.

BNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments were a surprise, and would add “a degree of raised uncertainty” about when the central bank would start to lift interest rates from their record low of 0.5 percent.

Little is known about Shafik or Haldane’s views on monetary policy, though Portes said she had been sympathetic to the IMF’s move away from its highly orthodox policy prescriptions.

Broadbent and Dale both voted against the Bank’s final expansion of asset purchases in July 2012, while Fisher was part of a dovish minority under former governor Mervyn King who wanted more asset purchases up until King’s departure in June.

Broadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor. He will be responsible for the BoE’s analysis of Britain’s economy, as well as bank notes.

Britain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank. Habgood is chairman of brewer Whitbread and publishing company Reed Elsevier .

Habgood succeeds David Lees, whose term expires on July 1.###3971||Empty###3972||If you found this interesting or useful, please use the links to the services below to share it with other readers.

Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.



The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado's Department of Revenue.



The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 this year by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.



"The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations," said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.



Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.



After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year - even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.



In Alaska, campaigners are "very hopeful" of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are underway, though in more preliminary stages.



President Barack Obama's administration told federal prosecutors in August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.



Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be "significantly affected in both directions" by various factors.



A "possible increase in initial demand" could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licensed and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.



"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," said Brohl.

American Airlines Group Inc. said Monday that the cancelations hurt first-quarter profit, but it didn't give a figure. The company said it expects to give more details in early April.

Despite the storms, the company said, a key figure of revenue for every seat flown one mile rose between 2 percent and 4 percent in the first quarter. That statistic rises when an airline fills more seats or raises average fares.

American and US Airways canceled about 28,000 flights in the first two months of the year, up 164 percent from the same period in 2013 as storms hit hubs in Chicago, Dallas and elsewhere.

Despite the cancelations, traffic rose 0.5 percent, as passengers flew 15.08 billion miles last month, up from 15.01 billion in February 2013.

American and US Airways boosted capacity by 0.8 percent, so the average flight was a bit less crowded; 78.4 percent full, down from 78.7 percent a year earlier. All of the capacity increase was on international flying.

Shares of Fort Worth-based American rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $39.71 in morning trading. They began Monday up 55 percent so far in 2014.

In California, for example, four big insurers have largely carved up the state’s market. The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California’s insurance market is now “moderately concentrated” instead of “highly concentrated,” according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit that focuses on health care.

“There are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,” Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said in a phone interview.

About 5 million Americans had signed up for private health plans through yesterday using the law’s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.

In California, WellPoint Inc.’s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state’s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state’s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.

State Changes

WellPoint also lost ground in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent, Kaiser said in its report released yesterday. In Connecticut, WellPoint’s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.

Kristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.

Before the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minnesota, has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state’s exchange, MNsure.

Enrolling Customers

Before the health law, the state’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.

The Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering “some of the lowest exchange premiums in the country” for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.

About 95 percent of Americans have a choice of two or more insurance carriers in their state exchanges, Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said in an e-mail. The government said in September that about 25 percent of companies offering plans on the exchanges were new to the individual market.

“All consumers shopping in the marketplaces also have greater transparency where they can compare comprehensive, affordable plans side by side to find the one that best meets their needs,” she said.

Open enrollment for exchange plans closes for 2014 on March 31.

Investing.com - European stocks were steady in choppy trade on Thursday, as the release of disappointing economic reports out of China dampened market sentiment and as the European Central Bank's latest policy move continued to weigh.

During European morning trade, the EURO STOXX 50 eased 0.06%, France's CAC 40 added 0.02%, while Germany's DAX 30 inched up 0.04%.

Investors remained cautious after data showed that Chinese industrial production rose 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, missing market expectations for an increase of 9.5%, while Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period.

The data added to concerns over the strength of the world's second-largest economy.

Meanhile, European equities remained under pressure after the European Central Bank's decision last week to refrain from implementing policy measures to shore up growth in the euro area, despite forecasting low inflation for some years to come.

Speaking Wednesday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said interest rates in the euro zone are too low from a German point of view. He also said he doesn't expect deflation to materialize in the euro zone.

Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders BNP Paribas and Societe Generale fell 0.12% and 0.50%, while Germany's Deutsche Bank declined 0.72%.

Among peripheral lenders, Spanish banks Banco Santander and BBVA eased 0.06% and 0.21%. Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit overperformed however, rising 0.13% and 0.50% respectively.

Elsewhere, Bouygues shares were down 1.26% after the company raised the cash component of its offer for Vivendi's French phone unit SFR to €11.3 billion to top a competing bid from cable billionaire Patrick Drahi.

Adding to losses, Adecco SA dove 8.33% after its largest investor said it will sell about 16% in the provider of temporary workers.

In London, FTSE 100 dipped 0.05%, led by Morrison, down 9.10%, after the U.K. grocer said profit will plunge this year and pledged to sell £1 billion of property.

Meanwhile, financial stocks were mixed. Lloyds Banking slipped 0.29% and the Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 0.52%, while HSBC Holdings climbed 0.69% and Barclays jumped 1.08%.

On the upside, mining giants Glencore Xstrata and Randgold Resources rose 0.26% and 0.86% respectively, while rivals BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto advanced 0.56% and 1.41% respectively.

In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.10% gain, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.14% rise, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.19% increase.

Later in the day, the U.S. was to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.###3984||Bananas are seen for sale inside Washington, D.C/'s Eastern Market. Chiquita Brands International, the US fresh food giant, and Ireland's Fyffes said they will merge to create the world's biggest banana company. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

Produce giant Chiquita Brands International said Monday that it will buy Irish rival Fyffes in an all-stock deal valued at $526 million, making the Charlotte-based company the world’s largest banana supplier.

The merger is sure to raise a stink in an industry dominated by a small bunch of suppliers. Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole Food and Fresh Del Monte control more than 80 percent of the world’s banana trade, according to the United Nations.

Chiquita estimates that the acquisition will result in annual revenue of $4.6 billion and produce operational savings of about $40 million by the end of 2016. The deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2014, has been approved by both boards. It is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

The combined company will be known as ChiquitaFyffes, with 50.7 percent of the firm owned by Chiquita shareholders and the remaining 49.3 percent held by Fyffes shareholders. ChiquitaFyffes, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will be incorporated in Ireland and have an estimated value of $1.07 billion, according to the company.

“This is a natural strategic partnership,” Ed Lonergan, Chiquita’s chief executive, said in a statement. “The combined company will also be able to provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.”

Lonergan will become chairman of the new company, while Fyffes’s executive chairman, David McCann, will become chief executive. ChiquitaFyffes will have a combined workforce of 32,000 employees in nearly 70 countries. It also will have a strong position in pineapples, melons and packaged salads, according to the company.

“This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business,” McCann said in a statement.

It is a difficult time to be in the banana business.

Exports of the fruit rose by 7.3 percent in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons, according to the most recent data from the U.N. Innovations. Refrigeration of bananas in transport has extended their shelf life and bolstered demand.

Yet pricing pressures from supermarkets are hurting producer profits, while growers battle higher production costs in the face of rising levels of disease, analysts say.

“Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins, and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival,” said Alistair Smith, international coordinator for Banana Link, a British nonprofit group fighting for fair banana trade. “Small farmers are under pressure from all sides, and big mergers like this can only make them more nervous about the future of their livelihoods.”

An unexpected oversupply of bananas in Guatemala and Ecuador created a soft market for Chiquita in the last three months of 2013, according to the company.

It lost $31 million during the fourth quarter, down from a $333 million loss for the same period a year earlier. Chiquita also was rocked by a persistent drought in the West that led to a shortage of iceberg lettuce and other ingredients needed for its Fresh Express-brand bagged salads.

The merger will unite two of the world’s oldest fruit distributors.

Chiquita began in 1870, when Capt. Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sailed them to Jersey City. The company made a name for itself in 1944 by introducing the world to “Miss Chiquita,” a cartoon banana that extolled the virtues of eating the fruit.

Not all of Chiquita’s history is as bright. The company, under the name United Fruit, forced regime change throughout the Caribbean and Central America during the 1950s and ’60s to protect its interests.

Chiquita filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001, crippled by trade restrictions imposed by the European Union. That year, it paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $100,000 to resolve allegations that employees concealed a bribe paid to Colombian officials for a customs license.

Payoffs in Colombia got Chiquita in trouble again in 2007, when the company handed the Justice Department $25 million for paying paramilitary groups $1.7 million for protection in the northern Uraba region. U.S. officials got involved because the groups were on the State Department’s terrorist watch list.

Dublin-based Fyffes has been distributing bananas since founder Edward Wathen Fyffe shipped his first bunch in 1888 from the Canary Islands to London. The McCann family has run the company since the 1950s.

Shares of Fyffes rose more than 40 percent on news of the merger, while Chiquita’s shares surged more than 10 percent.###3985||Empty###3986||MUMBAI, March 13 (Reuters) -

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — General Motors knew of an issue with its ignition switch several years before it has previously acknowledged.

The company said in a federal filing Wednesday that it discovered an issue with the Saturn Ion ignition switch in 2001 during pre-production development. General Motors has previously said it first learned of ignition switch issues in 2004.

The document said a 2001 internal GM report noted “an ignition switch design change had solved the problem.”

It wasn’t clear from the document if the issue discovered in 2001 was related to the issue that led to the recently announced recall of 1.4 million cars in North America. The issue cited in the recall has been linked to 13 deaths.

But it said a 2001 internal report noted “an ignition switch design change had solved the problem.”

GM said late Wednesday it has been conducting “a more in-depth analysis of the information related to the vehicles” it recalled.

“Today’s GM is fully committed to learning from the past while embracing the highest standards for quality and performance now and in the future,” said spokesman Alan Adler.

The issue behind the recall involves ignition switches the can be bumped out of the “Run” position into the “Off” or “Accessory” position. That can cause power braking and steering, as well as airbags, to stop working.

In 2004, a General Motors engineer accidentally knocked a vehicle out of “Run” while driving.

Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into the recall, as have members of Congress.

The recall includes the Saturn Ion and Sky, as well as the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR and the Pontiac G5 and Solstice.

™ & © 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.###3988||Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is sticking with its recommendation to buy Chinese stocks, the biggest losers worldwide this year, after valuations fell to the lowest level in a decade versus global peers.

“Given how share prices have corrected and given where the valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we can make a positive case on Chinese equities,” Kinger Lau, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index will climb to 12,000 in the next 12 months, a 24 percent advance from last week’s close, versus the brokerage’s December forecast for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014.

The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies will struggle to repay debt after the nation’s first onshore corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45 percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most in a decade.

China’s leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures to support growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. became the first company to default in China after failing to pay full interest due last week on onshore bonds.

Relative Value

The Hang Seng China index is valued at 1.1 times net assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI’s global index, which has a multiple of 2. The H-share measure slid 1.7 percent to 9,540.10 as of 1:41 p.m. in Hong Kong.

BlackRock Inc. named Helen Zhu as head of China equities, luring the New York bank’s chief China equity strategist away from Goldman Sachs. The appointment takes effect on April 7 and Zhu may start managing funds later this year, BlackRock said in a statement. The New York-based firm is the world’s largest money manager, overseeing about $4.3 trillion.

Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. all trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of China Ltd. has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders are the nation’s biggest by market value.

“Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt would likely be positive catalysts for banks,” Lau said. “Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very significant crisis scenario.”

Regulated Borrowing

Premier Li Keqiang told the National People’s Congress last week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified sectors of the economy in need of consolidation.

While Chinese banks’ non-performing loans rose by 28.5 billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan, the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1 percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said Feb. 13.

Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio of about 7 percent, Lau said.

Global Outlook

An improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name specific stocks.

The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from 5.6 percent. China is the world’s biggest exporter.

China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in 2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012.

A purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion.

Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report, extending the longest decline since 1999.

Share Slump

The Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, predicted on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the end of 2014.

Goldman Sachs’s forecast formed part of a trade recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth top recommendation for 2014.###3989||Empty###3990||US employers have advertised slightly more jobs, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.

The Labor Department says employers in January posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 per cent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped four million since March 2008.

The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.

Total hiring slipped 0.9 per cent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly five million people are hired each month.###3991||Empty###3992||Empty###3993||Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.###3994||Empty###3995||Empty###3996||Empty###3997||###3998||Butterbeer and more: What to eat at new Harry Potter theme park###3999||This will appear next to all of your comments

“Most of you could do it,” Bewkes said.

However, he did say that technology was one area where Time Warner, HBO’s corporate parent, is working to improve. His remarks came Tuesday morning at the Deutsche Bank Annual Media, Internet & Telecom Conference.

“We’ve got a lot of demand … we want to continue to make HBO Go stronger,” he said.

It’s not clear how many subscribers were unable to access the show, but Twitter exploded as people complained of technical difficulties, forcing HBO to officially acknowledge the problem.

The issues prompted The New York Times’ David Itzkoff to tweet, “Next week on True Detective: Marty & Rust frantically scramble to log onto HBO Go to learn what happened this week on True Detective.”

Most of Bewkes’ remarks accentuated the positive. He said that the popularity of shows such as “True Detective” are evidence of a “TV revolution” that is enriching content creators such as Time Warner. The media chief said that 90 percent of his company’s revenues come from the television production ecosystem — one that encompasses everything from the syndication returns for shows such as “The Big Bang Theory” to the retransmission fees Time Warner owned networks such as TNT and TBS receive from cable providers eager to carry their programming.

Also read: ‘True Detective': What We Know About Season 2

“There’s a huge and growing demand globally for original television product,” Bewkes said, noting that the amount of money being spent on television programming is greater than ever, as is the demand for quality television such as HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and “Veep.”

Bewkes credited the premium cable channel with raising the bar on the kind of thought-provoking and challenging fare that has led to a small screen renaissance, and with altering the way that people watch content. HBO started its own on-demand service 15 years ago, a harbinger of an interconnected world that allows people to stream programs to their phones, tablets and other devices.

“The whole television dial is going to convert itself to on demand,” Bewkes predicted saying that programming is “going to go with you wherever you go.”

Provided that is that HBO Go doesn’t crash.###4002||Why did this happen?

Speaking at a Treasury Select Committee hearing, Carney said it is also likely that the Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) headquarters will have to be moved to London, as European Union law stipulates that the country, which is registered as the firm's HQ, is responsible for common deposit guarantees and bank bailouts.

Britain's business secretary Vince Cable also said over the last two months that it is likely that the RBS's headquarters will move to London permanently, if Scots vote for independence.

"If the circumstances were to come to pass that there were the prospect of a change to the monetary arrangements in the United Kingdom that fell to the wrong side of the risks that were clearly outlined in my speech, we would provide clear and public advice on those," he added.

Meanwhile, Carney also warned politicians that since Scotland's economy is "volatile" and is especially vulnerable to energy price movements, it could spell trouble for the country if it decides to end the 307-year union with England.

Scottish people will vote in an independence referendum on 18 September this year and will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"

However, despite the Scottish National Party (SNP) repeatedly promising voters that most of the financial and regulatory laws will remain the same, UK and European Union politicians have explicitly said that if Scotland breaks away from Britain, it will lose the currency, lose it EU membership, and be forced to create and uphold its own set of laws and watchdogs.

Scotland's financial services accounts for about 150,000 jobs.

Most recently, Alliance Trust revealed in its financial results statement that it has set up a raft of England-based companies in a bid to protect itself against the possibility of Scottish independence.

The Dundee-based investment manager's chief executive officer said in its results statement that it was necessary to start establishing non-Scottish companies as it hedges its bets against Scotland breaking away.

"The referendum in September is creating uncertainty for our customers and our business, which we have a responsibility to address," said Katherine Garrett-Cox.

Garrett-Cox added that the uncertainty over whether Scottish independence would change taxation laws and regulation was a catalyst behind the decision.

At the end of February, insurance firm Standard Life said that it may quit its Scottish home if the nation breaks from the United Kingdom in its referendum on independence in September 2014.

"We have been based in Scotland for 189 years and we are very proud of our heritage. Scotland has been a good place from which to run our business and to compete around the world," said Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Standard Life, in the Edinburgh-based insurer's annual report for 2013.

"We very much hope that this can continue. But if anything were to threaten this, we will take whatever action we consider necessary - including transferring parts of our operations from Scotland - in order to ensure continuity and to protect the interests of our stakeholders.

"We will continue to seek further clarity from politicians on both sides of the debate, so that we can reach an informed view on what constitutional change may mean for our customers, our business and our shareholders."###4004||Happy 5th birthday, Mr. Bull Market -- it seems like only yesterday that you sprang from the loins of a dying Bear. Yet, on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) put in its crisis low of 676.53. Investors had given up on stocks in an environment in which they were being bombarded with seemingly catastrophic headlines on a daily basis.

Seven days earlier, troubled insurer AIG had reported a $61.7 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 -- the largest loss in U.S. corporate history. Two days after that, General Motors disclosed to its shareholders in its annual report that "there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern" (the company was ultimately restructured under bankruptcy protection.) On March 9, the CBOE Volatility Index (VOLATILITYINDICES:^VIX), or VIX, which is sometimes referred to as Wall Street's "fear index," closed at 49.68 -- it has not closed above that since then.

What did we know then?

Instead of imminent doom, however, investors might have anticipated that, barring outright economic collapse, there was a decent chance that stocks would perform reasonably well over the next five years (though the market's actual performance has exceeded what one could have hoped for).

Why?

Valuations. On March 9, the S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, stood at just 11.9 -- cheaper than it had been at any point since 1986 (the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric popularized by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, compares stock prices to an average of inflation-adjusted earnings per share over a trailing-10-year period).

And so it was that the fear and revulsion that brought low risky assets in general, and equities in particular, set the foundations for a stunning bull market:

For the S&P 500 (blue line), which now boasts a 178% price return, a triple is almost in sight, if not immediately within reach. Note that the broad market, as represented by the Wilshire 5000 index (orange line) has done even better, thanks to the huge outperformance of small-capitalization stocks; the Russell 2000 (red line) has well more than tripled over the past five years. (Although the S&P 500 is the most widely used measure of the market's performance, it's technically a large-capitalization index.)

Where do we go now?

But where do those gains leave valuations today and what does that augur for returns over the next five years?

As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 now sports a corpulent CAPE of 25.6, going from a 27% discount to its long-term historical average five years ago, to its current 55% premium. That puts the CAPE into the highest 10% of its values over its entire history going back to 1881.

As hedge fund manager Cliff Asness observed in a November 2012 paper, historically, when the CAPE is within the top decile of its values, subsequent stock market returns are mediocre, with a 10-year real return that has averaged just 0.5% on an annualized basis (it's important to note, however, that the range of returns is very wide, varying from (6.3%) to +6.1%).

Last month, another well-regarded value investor, James Montier of GMO, published a white paper describing two methods to forecast real returns over the next seven years based on the CAPE. The more optimistic estimate called for an annualized return of just +0.8%, while the more pessimistic produced a (3.2%) loss! Those ought to be sobering figures, particularly for individual investors who have only now begun to drink directly from the equity market punchbowl.

With the prospect of such mediocre returns, should investors be selling their stocks instead of buying? My answer is "no." As my Foolish colleague Morgan Housel has highlighted, the CAPE isn't perfect (though I would argue it's the best metric we have) and even with a high starting CAPE value, the range of outcomes in terms of performance is very wide. As Cliff Asness points out:

I would, if trading on a tactical outlook, give the Shiller P/E some small weight, particularly when it's above 30 or below 10. But I think this type of analysis is most useful not for a trading strategy but to set reasonable expectations.

If you are a "know-nothing" investor (there is no shame in this -- it's the path almost every investor should adopt), the lesson is to temper one's expectations for future stock market returns -- the next five years are unlikely to mirror the past five and they could end up being very disappointing relative to stocks' historical average return (roughly 6.5% per annum, after inflation). Still, if you have an equity-appropriate time horizon, you can continue to put money into a low-cost index fund at regular intervals.

2 values in a heated market

If you have some skill, experience, and time -- and the inclination to pick individual stocks -- know that it's becoming increasingly difficult to ferret out names that trade at a discount to (or even at) their intrinsic value. However, there are still some values out there. Take the insurance sector, for example: MetLife (NYSE:MET), the No. 1 publicly traded life insurer in the U.S., is a wonderful franchise, yet it is valued at less than 9.5 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate -- a significant discount to the overall market. Viewed from another angle, it does not take much in the way of returns on equity to justify the stock's 21% premium to its tangible book value.

Another insurance-related name, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), looks reasonably priced. In his recently released annual letter to shareholders, CEO Warren Buffett wrote that stock repurchases at 120% of book value "benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value exceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount." On Friday, Berkshire's shares closed at 136% of book value. My sense is that when Buffett refers to a "meaningful amount," it's more than the difference by which 136 exceeds 120.

When it comes to individual stocks or the broad market, valuation has predictive value with regard to future performance. Right now, the U.S. stock market doesn't look particularly cheap, and while that tells us nothing about the market's direction in the near term, it's an anchor on performance over the medium to long term. Just as investors who extrapolated bear market losses into the future five years ago were wrong, those who extrapolate similar gains to those achieved over the past five years could well be making the same mistake today.###4005||Why did this happen?

This time it's on Herbalife's business practices in China.

Pershing Square says they have done an investigation and that they have evidence that the company is operating in violation of Chinese law.

"The report will show that Herbalife's business in China operates much like the company's business in the rest of the world - as a pyramid scheme," Pershing said in a press release.

Refresh this page for live updates.

In late 2012, at a special Sohn Conference event, Ackman publicly declared that Pershing Square was shorting $1 billion worth of Herbalife stock. In a 342-slide presentation, Ackman laid out his thesis that the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals, particularly from the Hispanic population.

It's his belief that regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to investigate and shut the company down.

Herbalife has denied Ackman's allegations.

What's more is a number of hedge fund managers, most notably Ackman's rival Carl Icahn, have snapped up significant long positions in the stock.

The Herbalife short has been Ackman's "biggest loser" in his hedge fund's history. Since Ackman revealed his short position, shares of Herbalife have surged. So far, he's suffered an estimated $500 million in paper losses.

He's continued to say that he will take this short "to the end of the earth."###4007||Why did this happen?

Asian equities were lower across the board, led by Shanghai and Hong Kong, as China reported an 18.1% yearly decline in exports for February. The dollar and yen rallied, while commodity currencies and

the offshore yuan came under pressure.

The iShares FTSE China (FXI) exchange traded fund is down 1.03% in the pre-market hours.

"We think seasonality and last year’s fake trade reporting contributed to the slump in exports and the trade deficit in China," BarCap analysts led by Jian Chang in Hong Kong wrote today.

A moderation in demand also played a part in the weakness in Chinese trade data. Barclays expects export growth to recover to the mid-upper single digits by May-June, and the trade balance to return to surplus by then. The focus will likely remain on China in an otherwise risk-off week, with January-February activity data due out on Thursday.

China's average Jan-Feb exports declined 1.6% year over year versus a 7.4% increase in the fourth quarter 2013 and a 4.2% increase in December and 10.6% in January.

Premier Li Keqiang and Finance Minister Lou Jiwei reiterated their confidence in the Chinese economy over the past few days, with Li saying the country was on target to grow 7.5% this year.

However, they cited improvement in external demand -- which reversed course in February. Li also said that reforms would have an impact in the second half. On Wednesday, Li promised to push ahead a slew of policy changes, including further cutting administrative review and approval items for new businesses, pushing forward hybrid ownership in the State-owned sector and reform of the fiscal and taxation system.

Sun Xuegong, a researcher at the Institute of Economic Research in Beijing, told China Daily on Monday that structural reform and growth are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and reform requires a certain level of economic growth.

"There is already a lot of talk that when growth is too fast it is not a good time for reform. But what has not been discussed much is when growth slows too much, it is not good for reform either, as decelerated growth and a stagnant living standard will curb the need for industrial upgrading," Sun was quoted saying.###4009||Empty###4010||This will shock you: Politico reports today that cable behemoth Comcast, famed for its taxpayer-funded tower and long waiting times, is fire-hosing money onto members of Congress who might have something to do with its proposed merger with Time-Warner Cable:

"The Philadelphia cable giant historically has been a major Beltway player, and it’s sure to strengthen its political offense in order to sell the new, controversial megadeal. Yet even before announcing its plans for Time Warner Cable, Comcast had donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it.

In fact, money from Comcast’s political action committee has flowed to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Checks have landed in the campaign coffers of Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), who oversee the chamber’s antitrust panel.

Meanwhile, the cable giant has donated in some way to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is planning a hearing of its own. And Comcast has canvassed the two congressional panels that chiefly regulate cable, broadband and other telecom issues, donating to practically every lawmaker there — including Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.)."

In a statement, a Comcast spokesperson says the donations are all in a day's work:

"“Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,” said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice. “It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers.”

So we'll throw it open to you, the consumer: Is the merger between the two communications titans a good thing or a bad thing? Will customers get more choices? Or will it just enrich shareholders?

Take our poll and have your say in the comments.

Usury in the USA

By Noureddine Krichene



Former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke locked the US into a regime of near-zero interest rates. Saving accounts are practically denied any interest income, losing about 30% a year in value compared to stocks and 15% a year compared to housing. To keep interest rates so low, Bernanke had to print billions of dollars every month, pushing the balance sheet at the Fed to US$4.2 trillion. And the Fed will keep increasing the money base ad infinitum, from $4.2 trillion to $10 trillion to $100 trillion, and eventually even further.



The damage inflicted by Bernanke is beyond imagination and difficult to reverse. The US went through a terrible financial crisis in 2008, and has been suffering mass unemployment, impoverishment and financial chaos. Like someone hooked on







heroin, the process of capital destruction has become politically irreversible. The addict cannot quit until he takes his life.



Usury laws once existed in many European countries. For instance, in the United Kingdom, usury laws once capped interest rates at 12% per year, then at 5% per year. But these laws were repealed completely in the mid-19th century to allow the market mechanism to allocate resources efficiently. Now the Fed has forced new usury laws on the United States by keeping interest rates so low.



The amount of money printed by the Fed has been a pure confiscation of wealth, undertaken to finance record fiscal deficits, stimulate the economy, reduce poverty, restore full prosperity, and re-establish full-employment. These are laudable objectives, and explain why the Fed has arbitrary power to sequester wealth. But this power has a dark side.



We should heed the words of Thomas Jefferson, the third US president and a strong opponent of central banking: "I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."



As the Fed continues to destroy the currency, personal assets like bonds will be worthless and millions of Americans will be reduced to poverty and homelessness. Democracy does not secure against totalitarian power.



All the Fed has really been doing is destroying capital. It is like someone who has an orchard and keeps cutting down trees, thinking his produce will be somehow greater than before. Finally, he will end up with no capital (trees) and no produce.



Fed maestros like Bernanke and his successor Janet Yellen are firm believers in Keynesianism and Marxism. Both ideologies have strong world-wide support. Top US universities as well as Nobel Prize laureates are among their advocates. Both ideologies are very attractive on paper, but in practice they have turned out disastrously. Countless lives were lost in Marxist revolutions around the world, and total economic disaster followed in Russia, Ukraine, China, and Indonesia.



Likewise, Keynesian economics appear to be very attractive. To get prosperity and full employment, all that the government needs to do is dig holes. Faithful to this doctrine, US President Barack Obama has spent trillions of dollars digging holes, hiking the US debt to incredible levels, without any impact on real investment and growth. Like a smoker who spends his money on cigarettes, all that is left are ashes. If these trillions of dollars were invested by the private sector, growth in the US and the rest of the world would have been formidable and full employment would have been achieved. Yet Obama remains adamantly committed to digging holes, confiscating private savings and turning real capital into ashes.



Pragmatic people are not interested in ideologies such as income equality. They are interested in immediate results, and efficient and workable methods. Engineers and doctors do not get locked into one type of method, irrespective of cost. If Thomas Edison, the inventor of light bulbs, had used only one type of experiment, we would still be using candles. And if someone gets lost, he will not remain stubbornly on the same road forever. He stops, asks people for directions, and changes course. Such is not the case with the Fed or Obama.



The US Fed has a full-employment mandate, which was introduced by a congressman in 1946 and has been cherished ever since. Perhaps one day a congressman will give the Fed a mandate to secure generous rainfall everywhere in the US. Entrusting the Fed with full employment caused the Great Depression and 25% unemployment for many years. It is utter nonsense. If we tell a carpenter to do heart surgery, it is easy to predict the outcome.



If the Bernanke-Yellen interest-rate confiscation of wealth is not the solution to full employment, then what is? The answer is the "invisible hand" of the market, which means the government has to abolish minimum-wage laws and unemployment benefits, and withdraw any support for unions. Once the labor market is fully liberated, only voluntary unemployment prevails. But as long as the sacred labor laws are in force, the zero-interest-rate regime will only worsen unemployment and spread financial chaos and plundering.



There is no government in the world that has been able to service a debt at 140% of gross domestic product; a sustainable debt should not exceed 30% of GDP. Saddled with high debts, governments either inflate them away or default on them outright. No government has ever indulged in the present style of US fiscal and monetary profligacy without running into hyperinflation and chaos. Fortunately for the US Fed, it dismisses any measure of inflation except "core inflation", which excludes many products. Hence, pushing Fed credit from $0.8 trillion to $4.2 trillion has had no effect on core inflation, which remains at one to 2%. But very high inflation is already raging in the stock markets and housing sector, and food prices have tripled over recent years.



The US is on an irreversible path of fiscal and monetary chaos and capital destruction. To prevent a collapse of over-inflated stocks, and to deal with a huge public and private debt, the US Fed has no choice except to destroy capital, currency, and savers. Politically, the process cannot be arrested for three reasons. First, politicians believe in the prevailing ideologies and can never cast any doubt on their truthfulness. Second, pressure groups such as Wall Street speculators, welfare recipients, and debtors will forcefully defend the subsidies they receive from the state.



Third, the dollar remains a key reserve currency. Therefore, the real burden of fiscal deficits and wealth confiscation is borne by the poor in the rest of world. People in Burundi, Rwanda and elsewhere have to squeeze their food intake so that millions of welfare recipients and borrowers can enjoy free wealth. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, malnutrition is deepening in many vulnerable countries. This is also leading to social unrest in many nations.

At the close of U.S. trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.41%, the S&P 500 index fell 0.51%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.63%.

Weak Chinese trade data continued to batter stock prices in a session void of major U.S. economic indicators.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling.

The numbers also sparked concerns that U.S. demand for Chinese-made goods may have taken a hit due to a string of harsh winter storms, which may reflect in Thursday's data on U.S. retail sales.

Retailer Urban Outfitters Inc. said it expects poor weather will contribute to lower sales and profit margins in the first quarter.

The uncertainty sent investors to the sidelines, as did ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine also helped push stocks south.

Russia remains at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions.

General Motors shares took a hit as a U.S. House panel was set to investigate U.S. regulators and the company's response to consumer complaints about ignition-switch failures that led to the recall of 1.6 million vehicles and are linked to at least 13 deaths.

Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average performers included McDonald's, up 3.76%, Visa, up 0.79%, and Wal-Mart Stores, up 0.65%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst performers included Goldman Sachs, down 2.09%, DuPont, down 1.96%, and United Technologies, down 1.80%.

European indices, meanwhile, finished largely lower.

After the close of European trade, the EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.06%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.48%, while Germany's DAX 30 rose 0.46%. Meanwhile, in the U.K. the FTSE 100 fell 0.06%.###4015||Empty###4016||The Federal Reserve is expected to alter its forward policy guidance to support the economy as early as this week. If the Fed emphasizes that they intend to keep interest rates low, it could be interpreted by the markets as a positive for stocks and risk-taking in general. With the Fed on deck, and given the S&P 500 recaptured an important support level, stocks could experience better than expected outcomes this week.

Guidance Takes Center Stage

The Fed has signaled in recent weeks that the threshold for altering their bond tapering schedule is high. Therefore, the market expects another round of tapering this week. The focus has shifted to forward guidance. In the current economic environment, forward guidance is the Fed’s way of signaling to the markets how long they expect to keep interest rates low. Forward guidance has been tied almost exclusively to the unemployment rate; that may change Wednesday. From MarketWatch:

The Fed’s current pledge is to hold rates steady until “well past” the point when the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. But the unemployment rate has steadily dropped over the past year, before ticking up slightly to 6.7% in February. “It is time to seriously rethink that 6.5% unemployment target because we are so close to it,” said former Fed governor Randall Kroszner in an interview with MarketWatch. Yellen has signaled that she would be comfortable with this change, analysts said, when she told lawmakers last month that the unemployment rate did not fully summarize the health of the labor market.

Vulnerabilities Call For Flexibility

While stocks staged an impressive rally Monday, this week’s stock market outlook video covers numerous observable signs of vulnerability. While vulnerable does not mean bearish, it speaks to the need to pay close attention this week from a risk management perspective.

Keeping An Ear To The Ground

It is always a good idea to review recent writings from The Wall Street Journal’s Jon Hilsenrath prior to a formal Fed statement. The excerpt below also points to guidance being the focus of this week’s Fed statement. From The Wall Street Journal:

New York Fed President William Dudley said on March 6 he thought the Fed should revise the guidance with the jobless rate so close to 6.5%. It was 6.6% in January. With Friday’s report that it rose to 6.7% in February, that takes a little pressure off officials to change their guidance right away. Still, Mr. Dudley said he believed March was the right time to strike new chords on the interest rate outlook. “My personal opinion is 6 ½% is not providing a lot of value right now in terms of our communications,” Mr. Dudley said. “So my personal view is this is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6 ½% threshold because it’s not really providing any great value. I’d rather do it before I reached that threshold.” To be clear, Mr. Dudley remains strongly supportive of Fed efforts to spur stronger growth and bring down unemployment. He said Thursday he was comfortable with the market’s view the Fed wouldn’t start raising short-term interest rates until mid- to late-2015.

Investment Implications – Key Support Still In Play

Just as we noted vulnerable does not mean bearish, the incremental risk-reduction steps we took last week are a form of risk management, not a shift to the bearish camp. The comments from my last article still apply:

Our core positions continue to be U.S. stocks (SPY) and technology stocks (QQQ). Last week our allocation to stocks contracted and our cash position expanded. The market remains in a more vulnerable state, but bearish conviction is not yet strong enough to carry the day, which can be seen in the flattish nature of the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average. The market’s current profile requires a high degree of flexibility. With a Fed meeting on this week’s docket, we must be willing to increase or decrease our equity exposure based on the incoming data and evidence.

The chart below shows the S&P 500 making a stand near a key range. Also note, the slope of the 50-day moving average is trying to turn back up in a bullish manner, which reflects improving investor sentiment relative to last week.

The S&P 500 Makes A Stand

Monday’s return to a risk-on bias allowed us to take a small incremental step on the growth side of the portfolio via the S&P 500 Equal-Weight ETF (RSP). If conditions continue to improve, we will further reduce our cash holdings and add to our stock positions.###4017||Empty###4018||Sami Aslam makes presence felt at Edgbaston

KARACHI: It was a tragic end to what was easily a very valuable innings for Pakistan.

The 20-year-old Sami Aslam was on his way to becoming the youngest opener to hit a century in England when a suicidal call resulted in his run-out on the sedonc day of the third Test against England. But by then, the left-hander had cemented his place for the fourth and final Test at The Oval by hitting a resolute 82. Sami faced 176 balls, hitting nine fours and a six in his valiant knock.

It was a highly important innings for Pakistan considering that Sami’s senior partner – Mohammad Hafiz – had departed for 0 after playing a rash shot off Jimmy Anderson in the very first over. Together with Azhar Ali, Sami put on a valuable partnership of 181 in 61.4 overs. Their second-wicket stand could well turn out to be a match-winning one for Pakistan, who are looking to bounce back after getting thrashed in the second Test at Old Trafford.

The Lahore-born Sami only made it to the playing eleven for the Edgbaston Test because of the fact that Pakistan’s first-choice opener Shan Masood had proved himself to be unreliable especially when facing Anderson.

Before Edgbaston, Sami had played two previous Tests, against Bangladesh last year, but made just 47 runs in three innings. In 30 first-class matches he has scored more hundreds (six) than he has half-centuries (four) which suggests he has the hunger to convert into big scores (three of his centuries are over 150) although his first-class average is a modest 35.47 at the moment. He was prolific at Under-19 level and is currently the second-highest run-scorer in U-19 ODI history with 1695 runs. He was captain of the Pakistan U-19 side when they toured England in 2013 and made two centuries in a tri-series, including 110 in the final against England, before catching the eye with another hundred in victory over India at the U-19 Asia Cup.###4019||After Sun Pharma received a USFDA import alert for its Karkhadi unit in Gujarat, shares of the company tanked nearly 6 percent in on Thursday. Speaking to CNBC-TV18 regarding the impact of the ban, Anmol Ganjoo, VP - Institutional Equities, JM Financial says since revenue contribution from the Gujarat unit is not more than 1-2 percent, the company is unlikely to suffer financially.

However, softer issues may possibly drag the management bandwidth as this is the first time the company has received an import alert, Ganjoo adds.

Below is Anmol Ganjoo’s interview with Ekta Batra and Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18.

Anuj: How material is this news? Do you think the stock deserves more punishment apart from the 4 percent fall that we have seen today?

A: There are two clear aspects to what happened with respect to the import alerts on Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. One, what is the direct financial impact; on that count we are not extremely worried because the revenue contribution from this plant was not more than 1-2 percent of the overall Sun Pharma sales. So, in terms of financial impact directly correlated to the plant in question is not material.

However, import alert is fairly significant as far as its impact on softer issues of the company is concerned. Sun Pharma has never received an import alert before, they had problem in Caraco but those got resolved a period of time. Therefore, net-net, financial impact directly correlated to the facility in the question is not meaningful but the multiple could be under pressure until clarity or resolution emerges as far as this particular plant and the regulatory issue is concerned.

Ekta: What are the softer issues that you are worried about Sun Pharma? Would you want more clarity from the management once they have received a red flag on this plant and more communication on that front?

A: I do not think we are worried on those aspects because if you look at the escalation ladder in the timeline associated, there are no standard protocols with respect to that. As far as 483 issues is and the disclosure of those to the market is concerned, I think that is a very recent development being followed by some companies but given Sun Pharma’s track record, I do not think they were under any obligation to report or communicate each 483.

However, what I meant by softer issue was when you saw an issue in Caraco, it took a lot of management bandwidth, we also see some time, not specifically with Sun Pharma but some times there can be collateral damage as far as sales is concerned and there can be remediation cost given that there is also API produced at this facility although it is for cephalosporin, which is not meaningful, there can be filings which can get delayed. So, out side the direct revenue contribution from a plant, there can be issues in terms of the drag this development has on management bandwidth and focus and so on and so forth.

With respect to Sun Pharma’s valuation multiple also there is some amount of comfort that this company is on top of most of the quality issues and this is a best in class company. That confidence to some extent gets shaken whenever you have a development like this.

Ekta: Do you think market is also factoring in the fact that the USFDA has been so highly vigilant on Indian companies in the past that there is maybe some amount of slack that they are cutting on Sun Pharma because of the incremental increase vigilance that we have seen from the US FDA front?

A: There has been anecdotal indicator to suggest that the US FDA activism or vigilance has increased many folds in the last six-ten months and you see that with actions across companies and follow-up on 483 but to extrapolate that this is some amount of witch-hunt or there is specific companies being targets and so on, I think that would be stretching it too far. This is because you also have to bear in mind that as far as the volume penetration of Indian pharma generic companies into the US is concerned, that has also gone up many folds and greater vigilance is fairly consistent with that increase in volume.###4020||Things are changing at the Bank of England. Only a week after its governance was criticised by MPs in the wake of scandals, there is to be a new deputy governor in charge of the division which deals with financial markets and banking.

And that new deputy governor is to be a woman - the first senior economist to work there since Kate Barker left the Monetary Policy Committee in 2010.

Nemat Shafik is her name (although she's know by her nickname Minoush) and she used to be a Whitehall mandarin - the top civil servant running the Department for International Development - before taking another very senior role as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC.

And she certainly is international, holding British, Egyptian and US citizenship - the IMF describes her as "a global citizen with a global reputation."

Part of Dr Shafik's job will include responsibility for "market intelligence" - which will include knowing about, and acting upon practices that led to the Libor and foreign exchange scandals in which the Bank's involvement is still emerging.

The Bank of England

Dr Shafik is joined by another deputy governor, Ben Broadbent (already a member of the Bank's MPC) and there is to be a new chairman of the Bank's Court - Anthony Habgood will now lead the body which oversees the Bank's actions and which has been criticised as "byzantine" and "weak" by the chairman of an influential committee of MPs, Andrew Tyrie. Mr Habgood is a businessman and brings real-world experience to the Bank; he is the chairman of Whitbreads and the publisher Reed Elsevier.

This evening the governor of the Bank of England will announce even more changes which may include more women in senior operational roles. When the governor took office he appointed the management consultants McKinsey to come in and suggest ways to reform the bank.

They are expected to include breaking down "silos" within the organisation where staff rarely talk across different parts of its divisions let alone work in different areas.The reforms are designed to make the Bank more "modern" according to Dr Carney.

Structural and cultural changes are underway as a different type of person comes to the fore at the Bank's headquarters on Threadneedle Street.

These changes cannot come a moment too soon. The Bank has taken on important new responsibilities as regulator of financial institutions, as well as its usual roles of managing the economy.###
