Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.
The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula.
The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand.

Bean said in a question and answer session after a speech that sterling’s current level was fine, but that a further appreciation might cause the BoE to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target over the medium term.
“If sterling appreciated, it would potentially reduce inflation because import prices would be weaker ... so we would be more likely to undershoot the inflation target in the medium term, and that would mean we would need to keep policy looser for longer than would otherwise be the case,” he said.
In his speech, Bean had said further sterling strength would make it harder for Britain to reduce its trade deficit and develop a solid economic recovery.###1012||The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

The Fed has kept short-term interest rates low, or at near-zero levels since December 2008, pursuant to stimulating the U.S. economy, and has maintained this so-called “ultra-easy” monetary policy since then, as the economy recovered from the doldrums of 2008.

REUTERS/StringerChina’s environmental problems such as pollution and water scarcity are expected to intensify as rapid migration pushes urban infrastructures to the limit.
The pledge to clean up the nation’s major metropolitan centres was made in a State Council plan for how to deal with China’s rapid urbanisation drive.
According to the State Council, 60 percent of the cities will meet national air quality standards in 2020, which it said was up from 40 percent in 2012.
However, at China’s annual parliamentary session earlier this month, officials said only three of 74 major cities met the pollution standards in 2013.###1433||You are using an older browser version.

Importantly, this upward movement in transportation stocks is very positive for equity prices in general since a key element of Dow Theory suggests that transportation stocks usually lead the industrials to higher levels as economic activity improves.
Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.
That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.
As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.###1436||You are using an older browser version.

GM says the ignition defect could cause the engine and electrical systems of an affected vehicle to be switched off while the vehicle is in operation.
It didn't launch the recall of the 1.6 million affected vehicles until last month, and it's that inaction that has sparked the investigations.
GM’s North America recall follows a separate recall launched by the company in China during December, which affected about 1.46 million vehicles built by a partnership of GM and Shanghai General Motors.
In that recall, problems involved the vehicles’ fuel oil pump, according to the BBC.###1447||Empty###1448||×remaining ofThank you for Reading!

"Every insurance industry executive I talk to thinks those proposals are silly," said Robert Laszewski, a health care industry expert, in an interview with It's All Politics.
When the ACA banned pre-existing conditions as a reason for not insuring someone, it obviated the need for the state-run high-risk pools, which is where people with pre-existing conditions formerly would turn.
A return to such high-risk pools would by definition mean revisiting a time when insurance companies used pre-existing conditions to exclude certain people.
"I can't imagine a Republican candidate wanting to go into a November election suggesting we go back on pre-existing conditions," Laszewski said.###1450||Empty###1451||"For the associates who use the program day-in and day-out, or even week-in and week-out, they love it," said Jim Turner, a Humana spokesperson.

"There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term, and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy," Johnson said.

The analysis shows New York's individual insurance market today is significantly more competitive today than it was in 2012 before the state created a health insurance exchange as part of Obamacare.
It gauged competitiveness by looking at the market share of the largest insurer, the number of insurers with at least 5 percent market shares and how evenly market share is distributed across insurers.
New York's exchange market is the most competitive of the seven states analyzed.
MVP Health Care, for example, has seen its market share grow to 10 percent, up from 2 percent before the advent of the health insurance exchange.###1624||It shocks me every day – when you do a search on Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any of the plethora of apps available – just how many businesses HAVEN’T claimed their search info.###1625||Last month, when Herbalife announced its new convertible bond, I discussed some of the implications of the deal.

The Social Security Administration funded research to look a range of issues, including the cost to the system of people using these planning strategies.
The research found that the cost of the file and suspend strategy to the Social Security system is very small, only about $0.5 billion per year.
For perspective, in 2012 the Social Security Administration paid out $645 billion in retirement benefits and the Social Security Trust Fund had over $2.8 trillion in savings at the end of 2013, according to the Social Security Administrations website.
Based on real-life reported behavior, its estimated that the real cost to the Social Security Administration would be closer to only $9.7 billion per year.###1778||Advanced SearchKeywordSearch by CHANNEL SECTOR MARKET AUTHOR###1779||Empty###1780||Why did this happen?

It looks like I missed a couple of things: “inducements” for small businesses and “guaranteed renewability” of policies.
And it’s worth keeping in mind that guaranteed renewability of policies has been the law for a long time, so it’s unlikely the GOP plan actually offers anything substantive on that point.
Basically, Republican health care proposals are always, always, always a repackaging of the four tired old points above.

HILSENRATH’S TAKETake note of the fact that central bankers are talking a lot lately about the impact of “persistent headwinds” against the economy.
They are making an argument that is central to view that they should keep interest rates unusually low even after they start rising from near zero.
New York Fed president William Dudley said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this month that “persistent headwinds” to growth explained why the economy would be unable to bear much higher interest rates in the years ahead.
Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said in a press conference last month that “persistent headwinds mean that, even in the medium term, the level of interest rates necessary to sustain low unemployment and price stability will be materially lower than before the crisis.” Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said in a press conference last September, “we expect that a number of factors—including the slow recovery of the housing sector, continued fiscal drag, perhaps continued effects from the financial crisis—may still prove to be headwinds to the recovery.”Here’s why this matters so much.###1812||The specialty clothing retailer reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 and revenues of $1.04 billion.

Legal experts in China, however, say laws governing direct selling are unclear and enforcement is often lax, which makes any tough regulatory action against Herbalife unlikely.
Some Chinese laws allow direct selling under limited conditions, while others ban so-called pyramid selling, when members make more money recruiting new members than selling the actual product.
