WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley

March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.

The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.

Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.

Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.

The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.

Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.

Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.

The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.

“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.

The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.

COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER

The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”

Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.

“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”

These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.

The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.

JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.

“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.

Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1284||Empty###1285||Why did this happen?

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and he has grown international retail sales,” he said about Guillon. “I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”

It was announced back in January that Mulberry’s profits were substantially low, bringing its share value down by a staggering 22%. Mulberry prices have increased significantly under Bruno Guillon as he tried to step away from “affordable luxury” and make the brand more upmarket.

Apart from domestic backlash against the ban, the move also triggered international condemnation. President Abdullah Gul also sided with the tech-savvy Turks condemning the ban. He reportedly flouted the ban of the social media platform by using his Twitter account to tweet out messages saying, the blocking of Twitter is “unacceptable.” Erdogan defiantly stood by the ban, saying he did not care what the international community thinks about the move. Twitter users considered the ban as a “digital coup.” Some of them even compared Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are firmly monitored. Reportedly, there are about 10 million Twitter users in Turkey. The recent anti-government riots in Turkey saw a rise in Twitter and Facebook users spreading anti-government propaganda.

This is a second Symantec CEO that has been fired in less than two years.

Via the Wall Street Journal:

Mr. Bennett had been CEO since July 2012, when he replaced Enrique Salem. A former General Electric Co. executive and Intuit Inc. chief executive, Mr. Bennett had initially joined Symantec as chairman. He aimed to retool Symantec to compete with a new generation of cybersecurity companies. But Mr. Bennett, 60 years old, couldn’t reverse falling revenues and hadn’t yet delivered on new products, former employees and a person close to the board said.

SYMC board member Michael Brown will take over as interim CEO until a replacement is found, the company said.

The computer security company that is known for its anti-virus software work has suffered declining revenue in recent months — down for the last two quarters.

At the end of December, Symantec revenue fell 4.8% to $1.7 billion though income rose 31%, in large part due to the company’s cost cutting.

Symantec said revenue in the current quarter would be $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, down from $1.75 billion last year.

SYMC stock is down 12% in early morning trading, but had been down 15% from last year prior to the news.###1291||Empty###1292||Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) today made available the results of the company's 2014 Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test on the Bank of America Investor Relations website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com under Events and Presentations.

Investors in securities issued by Bank of America should not rely on the Stress Test results as being indicative of expected future results.###1293||Former Symantec CEO Steve Bennett significantly impacted the company with internal changes and process improvements, but the company's board of directors thought the pace of change was far too slow to keep up with market conditions, according to an email written by newly appointed interim CEO Michael Brown.

In the internal memo obtained by CRN following the abrupt ouster of Bennett Thursday, Brown said he would take his temporary role to work closely with Symantec's leadership team and help drive the next phase of the company's transformation. Symantec, Mountain View, Calif., remains committed to creating 5 percent organic revenue growth and 30 percent operating margin targets by fiscal year 2017, Brown said. The time frame is a full three to four years since the company fired former CEO Enrique Salem. Symantec closes its fiscal year 2014 at the end of March.

Brown said Bennett led a series of successful initiatives that reorganized the company under his 4.0 strategy, unveiled last year. In a recent interview with CRN, Bennett said skeptics shouldn't count the company out. The transition disrupted 90 percent of the company's sales force, but he said the company was set to unveil future product improvements in the form of tightly integrated offerings later this year.

[Related: Expect 2014 To Be Another Transition Year For Symantec, Says CEO ]

"However, the board feels we weren't moving fast enough towards our 5 percent organic revenue growth target. Revenue growth is what's critical in building our company value," Brown said in the memo. "This decision is about finding the right leader to grow Symantec -- reflecting the board's view that Symantec has a tremendous market opportunity before us and terrific talent. Our priority going forward is to leverage our assets and talent to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and revenue growth."

The CEO search process typically takes between six and nine months, experts tell CRN. Brown in the memo addressed the ongoing senior management changes that has plagued the company over the past six months. In addition to its CFO, a longtime executive who led the company's product development and services strategy took his leave as well.

"I know that management changes can be distracting and we've had too many of them recently, but let's keep focused on delivering new products and supporting our customers," Brown said. "We have hired some great talent during the past 18 months which, combined with the team we already had in place, gives me confidence that we can accelerate our progress -- especially in building our go-to-market capability and brand, as well as investing in new product offerings."

Symantec has scheduled an "all-hands" meeting Friday and Monday for its Americas and EMEA teams. Meanwhile, Symantec partners say they are taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that Bennett's vision still comes to fruition, despite the latest upheaval. Istian Islam, a partner business manager at Unicom Government, said he met Bennett in during a public sector channel strategy session engagement last week.

"In general the meeting was positive. Some executives sometimes look like they are ready to depart, but he didn’t seem that way; he wasn't disengaged," Islam said. "As partners we've been seeing a lot of organizational changes, but the rest of the details have been in limbo, with no new certifications and training."

Bennett's organizational changes had been generally well received by financial analysts. Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza told CRN Friday that Bennett did a lot of heavy lifting, separating the sales force in a way that splits the company into its storage and core security and IT management products. It's not too far out of the question, according to Breza, for an activist on the company's board to make a move that could split away the company's storage unit. About 50 percent of the company's revenue is generated through its storage business, 25 percent through its Norton consumer endpoint security business and 25 percent through enterprise security sales.

"When it leaked that Symantec was going to buy Veritas [in late 2004], at that time it didn't make a lot of sense to anybody and it hasn't made any sense since," Breza said. "Bennett has been pretty adamant that the company wouldn't break up, but if you were looking to do so, the products are already separated and the sales force is now split more than ever before."

Following is the text of the memo Brown sent to employees:

I’m Mike Brown and want to introduce myself to you. I've been appointed Symantec's interim president & CEO. Yesterday, Steve Bennett was asked to step down as CEO and Board Member of Symantec. I know that many of our team members connected with Steve and this news may come as a surprise, so I've recorded a brief video to explain the board's decision and give you additional details. If you are unable to view the video, the message is also included below.

I will do my very best, with the support of our leadership team, to make this transition as smooth as possible for everyone. We will continue to communicate over the coming days but I encourage you to reach out to your managers and VPs with any questions or concerns you have.

Following is the message from Brown for those employees who could not view the video:

Hi, I'm Mike Brown. I've been a member of Symantec’s board since 2005 and I wanted to introduce myself to you today as I've been appointed Symantec’s interim president and CEO. Steve Bennett has been asked to step down as CEO and from the board of directors. While this announcement may seem sudden, I want to assure you that the decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative board process, and not the result of any event or impropriety.

The board recognizes Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future -- which we want to build on -- and we remain committed to our previously outlined 5% organic revenue growth and 30% operating margin targets in the FY17 timeframe. However, the board feels we weren't moving fast enough towards our 5% organic revenue growth target. Revenue growth is what's critical in building our company value. This decision is about finding the right leader to grow Symantec -- reflecting the board's view that Symantec has a tremendous market opportunity before us and terrific talent. Our priority going forward is to leverage our assets and talent to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and revenue growth.

In the meantime, we're not standing still. I'm looking forward to working closely with Symantec's leadership team to help drive the company's next phase of our transformation while the board searches for a new CEO. I know that management changes can be distracting and we've had too many of them recently, but let's keep focused on delivering new products and supporting our customers. We have hired some great talent during the past 18 months which, combined with the team we already had in place, gives me confidence that we can accelerate our progress -- especially in building our go-to-market capability and brand, as well as investing in new product offerings.

PUBLISHED MARCH 21, 2014###1294||Watch out, GameStop, you have a new competitor in the used game market. Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to “shake up” the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

Wal-Mart’s “true differentiator,” Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can’t compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It’s credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.###1295||Empty###1296||Hold Up!

A rare area of agreement about the financial crisis of 2008 is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the core of the meltdown and are in urgent need of reform. On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.

The plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress. Yet neither of these assumptions, on deeper examination, seems to be true.

To satisfy those who want low-priced mortgages on terms that private markets would never endorse, the plan makes explicit the government guarantee on debt which had been implicit for Fannie and Freddie. This would lower the interest rate on high-risk loans, while obscuring the cost of the subsidy.

To placate those who worry that this in turn would leave the government stuck with mountains of dud loans, a 10% capital cushion must be provided by investors to absorb initial losses.

A fee of 0.1% would be charged on all mortgage-backed bonds, with the proceeds going to three funds, two pre-existing, that will provide subsidies for housing. An as-yet undetermined insurance charge will be levied on top. The result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, "would be a strong step forward" to fixing "our flawed housing system".

If only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie. The first objection is that the law would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with a regulator atop other entities devoted to overseeing functions such as syndicating loans or bundling the loans of small banks.

When the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first. Then they tanked--presumably because investors reached page 387 of the 442-page text and found enshrined in legislation an earlier 2012 order by the Treasury that expropriated from private investors all profits made by Fannie and Freddie.

The move is unlikely to help attract the private money needed to supply the 10% in equity underpinning bonds issued under the new plan.

Opponents of Fannie and Freddie contend that the two played a key role in the crisis by encouraging the issuance of loans with tiny down payments through a benign-sounding "affordable housing" mandate. Nothing much has changed. Under the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.

Strewn through the proposed law are words such as "affordable", "equal access" and "underserved communities", which suggest that lending decisions will be based on political rather than credit criteria. "The result", says Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, "will be risky lending for those least able to cope."

The underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups. A better approach would be to handle these goals separately and explicitly.

Gox, the Tokyo bitcoin exchange that collapsed and filed for bankruptcy last month, said it had found 200,000 bitcoins that were held in a digital storage file.

Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement on the company’s website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching files that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed.

Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today’s rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million.

Plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the Bankruptcy Court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site.###1305||Empty###1306||Automaker Toyota has reached a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over the company’s handling of consumer complaints related to unintended vehicle acceleration. CNN reported the agreement would be announced this week, and Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges.

A Toyota spokeswoman told CNN, “Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years … During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization and we are committed to continued improvements.”

For the last four years, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan had been investigation allegations that Toyota had misled U.S. authorities after consumer complaints were made about unintended acceleration in its vehicles. As a result of the complaints, Toyota recalled millions of vehicles since 2009. The company has already paid more than $1 billion last year to resolve claims related to the recall.

The potential settlement was first reported by the Wall Street Journal which mentioned, according to its sources, that the settlement would allow Toyota to avoid criminal charges and that an independent monitor will be appointed to manage Toyota’s compliance with the terms of the settlement.

Currently, hundreds of civil lawsuits are pending in the matter and the company is still under an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The “sudden acceleration” issue gained public attention when in 2009 an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer and his family were killed in a crash. The cause was believed to be the gas pedal getting stuck under the floor mat of the car. The officer made desperate calls to 911 prior to the crash and pleaded for advice on how to stop the car. The car went up to 120 mph, then flew off the road and burst into flames, instantly killing everyone inside.

Following the investigations, Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles globally, even though the automaker continues to deny any fault in its systems, and pins blame on driver error or sticky gas pedals.

WASHINGTON � Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said yesterday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state � Iowa � where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that�s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month.

Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrate that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That�s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more-positive view of the nation�s job market than the employer survey did.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state�s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next-highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.

North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil- and gas-drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.

Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn�t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.

The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.

California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.###1312||Zee Media Bureau/Supriya Jha and Himanshu Kapoor

07:49 pm: Search for `best lead` called off

The search in the Indian Ocean for the possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane has been called off due to bad weather.

Australian rescue officials, searching the `best lead` said that the operation will resume on Friday morning.

Four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the remote ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

06:34 pm: Malaysia preparing to recover the flight data and voice recorders

After more than 12 days of search operation for the missing flight MH370, Malaysia is now preparing for the need to conduct deep-sea searches to recover the flight data and voice recorders.

If the jet is confirmed to have crashed at sea, the next step is to actually find the black box, Transport Minister Hishammuddin said on Thursday.

Menwhile, searchers flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean hunting for debris in “probably the best lead” so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.

05:53 pm:`Not hiding anything about MH370`

Malaysian consul general in India Mohamed Hatimi Abas categorically denied today that his government had hidden any fact about the missing Malaysian Airline aircraft, during his visit here, as per PTI report.

"It is a wrong perception about our government. Since there were many possiblities linked to the plane`s fate, people took it otherwise. But, I want to tell you that we never tried to hide anything from the people," Abas said.

US Navy`s high-tech search aircraft P-8A Poseidon is now hovering over that area in southern Indian Ocean where the possible debris was spotted, said the BBC.

The aircraft is a well equipped long-range anti-submarine warfare, surveillance aircraft capable of broad-area maritime operations and will clarify whether the objects spotted on satellite imagery really belong to the missing jet.

02:30 pm: US Navy aircraft Poseidon`s radar hits not linked to suspected plane debris, says pilot

Dousing hopes that the US Navy`s high-tech surveillance aircraft P-8A Poseidon had captured "hits of significant size", the pilot of the aircraft has said that the radar hits are not believed to be linked to objects identified by Australia, reported the CCTV news.

02:10 pm: Missing jet hunt a `logistical nightmare`

Stressing on the extent of difficulty involved in locating the possible debris of the plane, Australia Australian Defence Minister David Johnston told Sky News that the operation was a `logistical nightmare`, reported the AFP.

"This is a terribly complex logistical operation to identify what we have found via the satellite."

Johnston added that the investigators were in a "most isolated part of the world".

"We are doing everything we can to try to solve this potentially tragic mystery."

01:40 pm: `Wish the plane has been hijacked`

For the kins of passengers on board the missing Malaysian airlines Flight 370, the wait is agonizingly endless. And the news of Australian debris sightings only added to their disbelief and distress. If the debris is confirmed to belong to the missing jet, it would end all hopes for the survival of the passengers.

So Zhang Xinyu, whose mother was on the plane, hopes that the plane was hijacked and is hiding somewhere.

Speaking to the BBC, he said,"I`ve heard about the new findings by the Australians in the south Indian Ocean. If it is anything, it would be a bad news for us all. We all wish that the plane had been hijacked and is being hidden somewhere."

12:45 pm: `Something down there`, says crew aboard US Navy`s Poseidon aircraft

The crew of US Navy patrol aircraft P-8A Posiedon have expressed strong indications of "something significant being down there", referring to the possible debris of the missing jet.

He added that six navy ships and three aircraft have been deployed to look for the objects, which might be the fresh leads in the hunt for the disappeared plane.

10:50 pm: AMSA hints at bleak possibility of debris belonging to missing jet

Reiterating Australian PM`s remarks, AMSA`s John Young too hinted at the bleak possibility of the debris belonging to the missing jet.

"We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat (satellite) images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good," he said.

As many possible debris findings earlier, have turned out to be false, the officials are exercising caution this time.

10:25 pm: Objects might not belong to the missing jet: Oz PM

Australian PM Tony Abbott said that he had informed the Malaysian PM Najib Razak about the possible debris being spotted by the Oz satellites. But downplaying the new clue, Abbott said that the search would be quiet difficult and the objects might not belong to the missing jet.

AMSA`s John Young also sounded a note of caution saying: "We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat (satellite) images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good."

"The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370," Abbott said.

10:20 pm: AMSA shares details of the objects spotted

AMSA chief John Young is addressing a press conference sharing details about the object spotted on satellite imagery.

John Young says tells a press conference that the objects were located in the southern Indian Ocean about 2,500km (1,550 miles) south-west of Perth on Australia`s west coast.

He said that the objects were "of a reasonable size and probably awash with water and bobbing up and down over the surface".

He added that one of the objects is 24m long.

10:10 pm: Malaysia not sending assets to help search objects

Malaysia is not sending any plane to help locate the suspected plane debris and said that it is depending upon Australia for any trace of the objects that might be the parts of the missing plane.

Australian PM Tony Abbott said in the Parliament that a Royal Australian Airforce Orion has been diverted to look for the objects, reports said.

Orion will look for the objects in southern Indian Ocean and is expected to arrive today afternoon. Also, three additional aircraft are set to join the Orion in its search for what are being supposed to be the parts of the missing jet.

9:00 pm: Australia spots two objects on satellite imagery

In the latest information about the missing Malaysian Airlines plane, two objects that might be related to the Boeing 777, have been spotted by Australian satellite imagery, Australian PM said.

Australian PM Tony Abbott on Thursday told the Parliamnet that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)has received information based on satellite information of objects possibly related to the search.

"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified."

All earlier reports about the objects thought to be the parts of the missing plane, have ended up as false.###1313||Top Healthcare Stocks

Some of Symantec's top partners tell CRN that the move comes as a complete shock and signals continued turmoil at the company.

The Symantec board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. The company said a special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. Symantec stock was halted temporarily following the announcement late Thursday. It dropped as much as 10 percent in after-hours trading.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said Daniel Schulman, chairman of Symantec's board of directors, in a statement. "Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum.

Bennett was appointed CEO in July 2012, replacing Enrique Salem, who served in the position for three years but oversaw mediocre financial results. Bennett unveiled Symantec 4.0 in January 2013, which prompted a year of internal transition, including the layoff of hundreds of employees. He focused on overhauling the go-to-market strategy, impacting roughly 90 percent of the sales force. He told CRN last month that the company was preparing to unveil a product road map that included integrated parts of the security portfolio, but admitted that 2014 would be another year of transition. Symantec's third-quarter revenue, released in January, fell to $1.71 billion from $1.79 billion, a year earlier.

A Symantec Platinum-level partner, speaking on condition of anonymity, had been enthusiastic about the changes instituted by Bennett. The company was transitioning to rely more heavily on a select group of 100 or so U.S. partners, including the partner's firm.

"I admit this has me completely shocked. We have been getting so much about the need to buy into the 4.0 strategy," the partner told CRN. "The fact that there has been so much turnover and transition in such a short period of time will raise some question marks in the minds of our customers."

NEXT: Partners Express Dismay

Bennett's vision focused on creating a more integrated product portfolio but lacked specifics, said David Sockol, president and CEO of San Carlos, Calif.-based Emagined Security. Bennett focused on the transition rather than showing exactly where the company was truly going, Sockol said.

"They focused on how cool it was that the company was changing rather than what they were changing to," Sockol said. "Even the employees were having trouble with the vision; it all focused with the fact that it was changing."

Partners were growing increasingly frustrated that they haven't seen new products or more details about better integrated products, said Alex Moss, managing partner at Chicago-based consultancy Conventus, a Symantec partner. Products being introduced have long been on the road map and already anticipated, Moss said.

"Bennett moves very slowly, and that affected the partners as well as the customers," Moss said. "I think everybody was getting tired of waiting."

Jacob Tukuru, president of Tukuru Technologies, a Symantec partner based in New York, said there were some improvements, including internal streamlining, that made it easier for partners to do business with the company.

"It's a little surprising. I know from our perspective as a partner, things have improved over the last year," Tukuru said. "They made it easier to do business with them as a partner, and we use their cloud products, which are great. Before, it was very difficult to work with Symantec. They made it hard to get information about simple things like software licenses, and it was really hard to find the right technical support."

"This comes totally out of the blue. I'm shocked," said Michael Goldstein, president and CEO of LAN Infotech, a Symantec partner based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "From a partner perspective it's discouraging. We have just been hearing Symantec trumpet its turnaround plan, new products and how bright the future looked. Now, just as it feels like we are nearing the top of the Symantec mountain, Bennett is terminated? Now it feels like we are back to square one."

Goldstein said he was unaware of what led to Bennett's departure or what interim CEO Michael Brown might be able to do to lead the company. Brown's storage background, Goldstein said, is encouraging however. "The only silver lining is Brown might bring Symantec's storage products up to date. Symantec's Backup Exec is way behind the times. It doesn't even support Microsoft Server 2012," Goldstein said.

PUBLISHED MARCH 20, 2014###1316||Empty###1317||PERTH â€” Planes and a ship scrambled yesterday to find a pallet and other debris in a remote patch of the southern Indian Ocean to determine whether the objects were from the Malaysia Airlines jet that has been missing for more than two weeks.



The pallet was spotted by a search plane Saturday, but has not been closely examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes.



It was the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to run down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it disappeared over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people on board en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.



Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center, told reporters in Canberra, Australia, that the wooden pallet was spotted by a search aircraft on Saturday, and that it was surrounded by several other objects, including what appeared to be strapping belts of different colors.



A New Zealand P3 Orion military plane was then sent to find it but failed, he said.



"So, we've gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it," Barton said. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.



AMSA said the aircraft that spotted the pallet was unable to take photos of it.



"We went to some of the expert airlines and the use of wooden pallets is quite common in the industry," Barton said. "They're usually packed into another container, which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft. ... It's a possible lead, but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well."



Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for AMSA, said the maritime agency had requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines, but he was unsure whether it had been received as of yesterday night.



Malaysia Airlines asked The Associated Press to submit questions via email for comment on whether Flight 370 had wooden pallets aboard when it disappeared. There was no immediate response.



When Brazilian searchers in 2009 were looking for debris from Air France Flight 447 after it mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, the first thing they found was a wooden pallet. The military first reported that the pallet came from the Air France flight, but then said six hours later that the plane had not been carrying any wooden pallets.



In Australia, eight search planes departed from a military base near the southwestern city of Perth on yesterday to scour an area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) away in an extremely isolated part of the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite images, the most recent released by China on Saturday, have showed large objects floating in the area that experts want to check to see whether they came from the jet.



Air and sea searches since Thursday have not produced any results.



John Young, manager of AMSA's emergency response division, said yesterday's search was mainly relying on human eyes.



"Today is really a visual search again, and visual searches take some time. They can be difficult," he said.



Barton said while the weather was not as good at the start of the day, with sea fog and low clouds, it was clearing up later yesterday.



Despite the frustrating lack of answers, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was upbeat.



"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope â€” no more than hope, no more than hope â€” that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft," Abbott told reporters in Papua New Guinea.



The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had refined the search based on the latest clue from the Chinese satellite showing an object that appeared to be 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet). It said the object's position fell within Saturday's search area but was not sighted.



yesterday's search was been split into two areas within the same proximity, covering 59,000 square kilometers (22,800 square miles). The areas were determined by drift modeling, the AMSA said.



Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein posted a message on his Twitter account yesterday asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.



More than 300 Malaysian cycling enthusiasts rode their bikes to the Kuala Lumpur airport to remember the people aboard the jet. The cyclists decorated the bikes with small Malaysian flags and stickers that read "Pray for MH370."



The latest satellite image is another clue in the baffling search for the plane, which was carrying 153 Chinese passengers.



"China hopes that these data will be helpful for searching and rescuing efforts," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement.



After about a week of confusion, Malaysian authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777-200 for several hours after it disappeared indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches toward Antarctica.



The discovery of the initial two objects by a satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to a stretch of the Indian Ocean southwest of Australia.



Two military planes from China have arrived in Perth, and AMSA said they would join the search on Monday. They join Australian, New Zealand and US aircraft. Japanese planes are also expected soon.



Because the search area is a four-hour flight from land, some of the planes can search for only about two hours before they must fly back. Others may be able to stay for up to five hours before heading back to the base.



Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.



Authorities are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.###1318||EVIDENCE hat Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ended up in the vast, desolate waters of the southern Indian Ocean appears to be mounting - but the quest to find the doomed aircraft itself is still proving tortuously difficult.

French satellite pictures handed to Malaysian authorities on Sunday show possible debris from the missing Boeing 777, photographed in broadly the same area as objects picked up by Australian and Chinese satellites last week.

A plane scouring the search area, about 2,500km south-west of Perth, spotted a wooden pallet and other objects late on Saturday (UK time), including what looked like variously coloured straps or belts.

However, it was unable to get up close or take photographs, and other aircraft dispatched to the site on Sunday could only see seaweed.

Nonetheless, the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, expressed cautious optimism about a possible breakthrough in the 16-day hunt for the plane, which vanished off civilian radar screens with 239 passengers and crew during a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope - no more than hope - that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft," he said.

An Australian aviation expert, Neil Hansford, said he believed there was a "high likelihood" that the satellite photographs show wreckage from the plane.

A Malaysian statement about the French images gave no details about the number, size or precise whereabouts of the objects, merely describing them - in a reference to one of two broad arcs identified as the plane's likely final location - as "potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor".

The photos have been relayed to Australia, which is co-ordinating the search which began last Thursday deep in the southern Indian Ocean, after the first grainy images emerged of objects floating in the churning waters.

One large object, photographed by Australian and Chinese satellites, could be an aircraft wing - or a lost shipping container.

Mike Barton, from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said wooden pallets were commonly used in the airline industry, "usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft". Pallets were, however, also used in shipping, he noted. The agency has requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines.

The eight aircraft searching on Sunday - which included two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76s and two Japanese P2 Orions - focused on two areas covering 59,000 square kilometres.

A marker buoy was dropped at the site where the pallet was spotted so that its movement could be tracked. The air search is being supported by several ships in the area.

Mr Abbott said of the hunt: "We owe it to the almost 240 people on board the plane. We owe it to their grieving families. We owe it to the governments of the countries concerned to do everything we can to discover as much as we can about the fate of MH370."

Relatives are now enduring a third, agonising week of waiting for news.

Wang Zheng, whose parents, Wang Linshi and Xiong Yunming, were among 153 Chinese passengers, told Associated Press in Beijing: "Biggest of all is the emotional turmoil I've been going through. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I've been dreaming of my parents every day."

Mr Wang, whose parents were among a group of Chinese artists touring Malaysia, last spoke with them on the night of their departure, shortly before they boarded the plane. They were filling out exit cards at the airport, and told him they would call him on their arrival in Beijing.

Like other relatives, he is praying that the possible debris turns out to be a false lead - meaning that his parents could still be alive.

"I will stay here until they give me an answer," he said, speaking at a Beijing hotel where families attend daily briefings. "I am not leaving until I know for certain where my parents are."

The search will resume again tomorrow, but the threat of bad weather still looms, with a cyclone reported to be heading towards the search area at the moment, which will cause difficult conditions with strong winds, though it is expected to lose its strength over the next few days.

Today the Telegraph reported the investigation into how the plane carrying 239 people on 8 March went missing is becoming increasingly centred on the two pilots, following an extensive analysis of data from the plane.

According to senior sources involved in the investigation, the paper reports that authorities remain certain the disappearance of flight MH370 was a result of a "deliberate act" by a "person or persons on board".

Malaysian police have denied reports in the Mail Online that the missing flight's Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah received a two minute phone call from a woman before take-off.

The woman is supposed to have bought a pay-as-you-go phone to make the call with fake ID and the paper claims the discovery raises fears of a possible link between the Captain and terrorist groups who use untraceable SIM cards.

Assistant commissioner Datin Asmawati has called the claims "mere speculations."

He said: "Please be advised that the Royal Malaysia Police take no responsibility over the dissemination of such information which originates from unnamed and unverified sources."

"Secondly the IGP has never issued any public statement that categorically places the MH370 investigation under any act of terrorism," he added.

AMSA said it had refined the search based on the latest clue from the Chinese satellite showing an object that appeared to be 72 feet by 43 feet, when it started its mission today. It said the object's position also fell within yesterday's search area but it had not been sighted.

Yesterday's search was split into two areas within the same proximity covering 22,800 square miles. These areas have been determined by drift modelling, the AMSA said.

“You hear this word ‘totalitarian’ when people share their anticipations about the future,” says Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “I would say there’s no disagreement that harder times are in store.”

Social media has been awash with expressions of gloom and shame. “People! What’s happened to our country?” Yuri Timofeyev, a photographer for the news website Grani.ru, wrote on Facebook after Russian troops invaded Ukraine’s Black Sea peninsula. “Fallen apart?”

President Vladimir Putin’s signature on Friday finalized Russia’s fast-track annexation of Crimea, condemned by most of the international community and punished by the West with sanctions against his inner circle.

The EU added 12 more Russian officials to its list shortly after, including the powerful deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and two Putin aides.

But on the home front, Putin’s confrontation with the West has earned him his highest ratings in years by playing to the conservative sentiments he’s cultivated since returning to the presidency two years ago.

Russians have been treated to a heavy-handed state-run media campaign of imperial nostalgia and historical revisionism aimed at portraying Crimea — which holds a special place in the collective imagination here — as Russia’s rightful property.

Almost 80 percent of respondents said they supported annexing Crimea in a survey conducted earlier this month by the independent pollster Levada Center.

The same poll found 58 percent backed sending Russian troops into Crimea and other regions of Ukraine, including the east, where unrest continues to simmer.

That’s unsettling Moscow’s chattering classes, which see a darker side to Putin’s ambitions.

He has “cynically raised nationalist fervor to a fever pitch; imperialist annexation is a strategic choice to bolster his regime’s survival,” Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition politician, wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday.

“Mobilizing the masses by distracting them from real problems like corruption and economic stagnation can take place only beneath the banner of fighting external enemies.”

Among those enemies are Ukraine’s fledgling post-revolutionary authorities, now scrambling to reassert control over a divided country in the wake of a protest movement partly spearheaded by nationalist groups painted here as “Fascists.”

Moscow’s campaign to win back Crimea has included appeals to locals there touting Russia’s political stability and brighter economic future.

Critics here in Moscow argue the Kremlin’s land-grab is being presented through rose-colored glasses.

Arkady Babchenko, a prominent Moscow journalist, echoed that view in a sardonic column titled “Welcome, Crimea!” in which he acquainted Crimeans with Russia’s stuffy state-controlled media, forced military conscription and crippling corruption.

“You will no longer choose — nothing, never,” he wrote in the magazine Snob. “Not even the colors of the curb in your courtyard.”

As the geopolitical drama unfolds in Ukraine, the independent media at home is being subjected to largely underreported crackdown.

Earlier this year, TV Rain — Russia’s only critical-minded television station — was dropped by major cable providers after it aired a poll asking viewers whether the Soviets should have surrendered St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad, during its brutal 900-day siege at the hands of Nazi Germany during World War II in order to save countless lives.

Kremlin-loyal bureaucrats lashed out over what they called an affront to historical memory.

On Thursday, reports suggested that TV Rain may be kicked out of its studios in a sprawling central Moscow complex that houses much of the remaining independent media.

Meanwhile, the well-respected editor of a major news website, Lenta.ru, was fired last week after her outlet published an interview with a leading Ukrainian nationalist whose militant right-wing group played a key role in the protests. Russian police have charged him in absentia with “extremism.”

The editor, Galina Timchenko, was replaced by a Kremlin-friendly journalist while much of the staff resigned in protest.

Lipman, the Carnegie researcher, says the independent media sector is “noticeably shrinking” thanks to such measures.

“For someone who has lost a job with a decent publication — by decent, I mean guided by professionalism and not a desire to please the Kremlin — there are fewer and fewer opportunities,” she says.

That’s part of a broader development of state-enforced patriotism aimed at breeding loyalty to the Kremlin, Lipman adds.

If there were any doubts, one need only look at Navalny, who was arrested last month and placed under house arrest for two months. His immensely popular blog — where he’s uncovered graft and lavish spending by the members of the country’s ruling class — was blocked last week after he criticized Russian policy in Crimea.

Perhaps most telling, however, has been the fate of Roman Romanenko, an otherwise unnoticed journalist in the Vologda Region— about 300 miles northeast of Moscow — who jokingly appealed to Putin send in troops to protect the Russian speakers in his region.

Moscow’s incursion into Crimea was launched under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking residents from an allegedly predatory government in Kyiv.

“Our sick are unable to obtain the medicine and treatment they need, the level of our education drops every year, children's after-school programs are being shut down, agriculture has been virtually destroyed,” Romanenko wrote on Facebook.

“We are suffering very much.”

The humor apparently didn’t register with the regional governor, who requested that Romanenko be investigated over his appeal.###1321||New York - Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in programme to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart stores for store credit but not cash. The credit can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy.



In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21%, and the company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2bn pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart US.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that Wal-Mart works with on its trade-in programme for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game programme.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy offer used video trade in programmes, but the Wal-Mart's new programme is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in programme.

Wal-Mart made a point of saying that credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6%, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19% since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new programme isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.



In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

Wal-Mart shares rose 23c to $74.92 in morning trading.###1322||Empty###1323||Empty###1324||Earl Stewart, owner of Earl Stewart Toyota, shows the faulty accelerator pedal on a recalled vehicle in North Palm Beach, Fla. in this 2010 photo (Photo: Alan Diaz AP)

If General Motors needs any more indication of how its own safety issues could play out, it need look no farther than Toyota.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Toyota will pay $1.2 billion to end a criminal probe into its handling of reports of unintended acceleration.

That's on top of millions of dollars in fines to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and class-action settlements.

General Motors is now under fire for deadly ignition switches in 1.6 million vehicles built in the middle of the last decade that are part of the worldwide recall announced last month. It's just starting the process.

MORE ON GM: CEO Mary Barra admits automaker didn't act fast enough on deadly switches

Just as the Justice Department closes its criminal investigation of Toyota, it was disclosed last week that a new one is believed to be underway involving GM.

"The timing of this (Toyota) settlement is interesting because it means the government will finalizing the last major automotive recall, Toyota's unintended acceleration, just as it gears up for the next big recall related to GM's ignition switch," says Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, in a statement. "The cases are similar because they both involve a long, established history of vehicle incidents that took years to identify and address."

ALSO: Justice Department to settle criminal case with Toyota for $1 billion

Just as Toyota's CEO was brought from Japan to testify to congressial committees, GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that it's "likely" she will be called to testify to congressional panels as well over the switch issue.

She says GM took too long to acknowledge a problem. She named a safety czar, just as Toyota did when it was under fire.

It's yet to be seen how the ignition switch issue will play out for GM. But its executives have to be paying close attention to Toyota's travails -- and be worried.

Beginning March 26, shoppers will be able to trade-in their used games at any Walmart or Sam’s Club store. Instead of cash, the retailer will offer a Walmart/Sam’s Club gift card in exchange for the games. The gift card won’t be limited to games and can be used on anything in the store or on the Walmart/Sam’s Club website. To be eligible for Walmart’s trade-in program, the games must be in playable condition and in their original box. And a Walmart employee will check them for “obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks” before trade-in credit will be issued.

So what does Walmart plan to do with all these used games? After the company takes possession of your games, they will be shipped off to a central processing facility where they will be resurfaced and repackaged. Afterwards, they will be sold in Walmart stores as “Certified Pre-Owned” titles. The process appears to be very similar to how Best Buy currently handles used games.###1327||The Telegraph is reporting that it has obtained the final 54 minutes of communication records from missing Malaysia Flight 370.

As the search continues for possible wreckage of the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, the transcript marks a further piece of evidence in the baffling mystery of flight MH370. It shows that -- according to numerous experts-- the two-way banter between Fariq Abdul Hamid, the co-pilot, and air traffic controllers was "perfectly routine."

The report focuses on two parts of the communication. During one portion, a message from the cockpit repeats that they were cruising at 35,000 feet. In another portion, the plane lost contact and changed direction just as there was a changeover among air traffic controllers, according to the UK paper.

But the run of messages between MH370 and the ground involved routine calls between the cockpit and air traffic controllers and gives no hint of the drama that was to follow. It is believed Hamid, as co-pilot, was the sole communicator.

An international search effort is underway to find the missing jetliner. There were 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board when the Boeing 777 lost contact on March 8. This week, the search has focused on a remote area of the Indian Ocean after two large objects, possibly debris, were spotted by a satellite.###1328||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Critics have suggested most of them had insurance before, but had to buy new plans because their old ones were not compliant with the new law.



The Obama administration has touted a recent Gallup poll that found the rate of uninsured Americans dropping to 15.2 percent in February—the lowest rate since 2008.



But McKinsey, a leading management consulting firm, polled about 2,100 exchange-eligible Americans in February, and found only 27 percent of people who had picked a plan were previously uninsured. Only 53 percent of them had paid their first premium, compared with 86 percent of the previously insured. With 5 million total enrollments, that would be about 715,500 previously uninsured Americans who had chosen and paid for new insurance.



It's also been hard to get a handle on how many previously uninsured people have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion in the states that chose to offer it.



The House Energy and Commerce Committee has held numerous hearings on the Obamacare implementation. Chairman Fred Upton has been a vocal critic.



"It's bad enough that the administration has repeatedly moved the goalposts and attempted to redefine what success means for the president's health care law. But the fact that they are deliberately avoiding the threshold measurement of how many of the law's new enrollees were previously uninsured begs the question: what was the goal?" the Michigan Republican said in a statement to CNBC.###1330||CLOSE Sally Beauty is the latest retailer to fall victim to hackers.

Yet another retailer is fessing-up with some details of a data snafu.

Sally Beauty, one of the world's largest retailers of professional beauty products, is reporting that a security breach discovered on March 5, affected fewer than 25,000 a credit and debit card accounts.

The Denton, Texas-based seller of beauty supplies says it is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm and says that it's working with the U.S. Secret Service.

"We take this criminal activity very seriously," the company said in a statement. "We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident. In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter."

WHAT TO DO: Protecting yourself from identity theft

For the nation's retailers, data breaches have become an explosive issue -- and a driver of serious consumer angst -- since Target reported a massive security breach shortly before Christmas. Other major retailers, including Neiman Marcus, have reported data breaches since the holiday season.

It's become a key concern for consumers, and some recent reports even show the data snafu may be cutting into customer traffic at Target stores as some concerned customers shop elsewhere.

Sally Beauty currently owns and operates more than 2,800 Sally Beauty Supply stores worldwide, including stores in every state in the United States; Puerto Rico and Canada. Sally Beauty Supply offers over 6,000 professional quality products for hair, skin and nails to retail customers and salon professionals.

The company has loyalty discount programs, such as the Beauty Club Card, for non-professional customers and the Sally ProCard for professional customers.

When liberal pro-Obama scholars question the legality of President Barack Obama’s actions to implement Obamacare, the issue of illegal presidential use of power moves from partisan to frightening.

George Washington Law School’s Jonathan Turley is the second most quoted law professor in the nation and a two-time Obama voter. He recently testified before Congress on Obama’s extensive use of executive orders and administrative actions to make unilateral changes in Obamacare, immigration policy, minimum wage and the IRS qualifying standards for non-profit status.

As to Obamacare, Obama, so far, changed it in at least a dozen major ways, including, but not limited to, postponing the employer mandate, allowing insurance carriers to let their insured keep an old policy, and, more recently, redefining the Obamacare “hardship” exemption so broadly as to nullify the individual mandate for at least two more years.

Was this legal?

Turley said: “President Obama has repeatedly violated this (separation of powers) doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. … ” We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.”

Turley challenged Congress to re-assert its authority. “If balance is to be reestablished,” he said, “it must begin before this President leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can ‘go it alone’ — not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.”

Obama sold Obamacare with many now-broken promises. Saving costs was a big one. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office set the net cost of Obamacare at $599 billion over 10 years — citing a gross cost of $848 billion less $249 billion in tax revenues and other cost savings. But recently the CBO revised the 10-year price tag to more than $2 trillion.

Economist Jonathan Gruber, the father of Romneycare — which was the template for Obamacare — recently admitted that well, no, costs will not be going down. “Covering people with health insurance doesn’t save money,” said Gruber. “That was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn’t designed to save money. It’s designed to improve health, and that’s going to cost money.”

So, Obamacare won’t save money, but at least those too poor to afford health insurance will now lead healthier lives, right? Not necessarily.

Oregon expanded its Medicaid program years ago — the way Obamacare does now — to include some of Oregon’s low-income uninsured. Because of costs, Oregon did this on a random lottery basis. Some got it, some, unfortunately, wanted to but couldn’t. But this allows comparisons. Oregon, for example, can now compare the health outcomes of the now-insured Oregonians against those who wanted to get insurance, but couldn’t. Surely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.

But there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes. While the newly insured did increase their doctor visits for preventative and primary-care services, some could not get appointments with doctors, many of whom wouldn’t take new Medicaid patients. Emergency room use went up 40 percent among the new Medicaid patients, not down — all for non-emergency medical needs. Forbes health care researcher Avik Roy writes, “The result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.”

Worse, the uninsured dislike Obamacare even more than do those with health insurance. A recent Kaiser Health poll found that among the uninsured, only 22 percent have a favorable attitude toward Obamacare, a far-lower percentage than the 56 percent of uninsured who are unfavorable toward Obamacare.

Before Obama became president, he said if he were “starting from scratch,” he’d go with a single-payer system. A few months ago, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid was asked whether Obamacare would lead us to single-payer. Reid said, “Absolutely.” This is the real plan.

Single-payer is universal healthcare system used in Canada. It remains popular. But in 2009, the incoming president of the Canadian Medical Association said: “(Canadian doctors) all agree that the system is imploding. We all agree that things are more precarious than perhaps Canadians realize.” What did the outgoing CMA president propose? He said: “A health care revolution has passed us by” and “competition should be welcomed, not feared.” So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.

In the annual index of countries rated on “economic freedom,” the United States — since 2008 — has slipped from the No. 5 position to No. 12. Canada — at No. 6 — is now more “economically free” than the United States! Economic freedom and prosperity go hand in hand.

Yet this administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation. President Obama is quite adept at the former — clueless about how to achieve the latter.

The used game trade-ins commence next week in select Walmart stores across the US.

This will start from Wednesday the 26th March at 3,100 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores across the States and later down the road we can expect to see pre-owned games on the shelves, although titles traded-in next week for credit will not be accessible for re-sell immediately.

For those looking for additional help when it comes to trading unwanted games the official Walmart website has posted a video tutorial, although games are already available. In an article on Games Industry they discuss Walmart’s introduction to the game trade-in business as the company look to prise some of the action away from leading competitors.

We can probably expect to see the used and traded games available to in-store consumers as early as this summer, as Walmart intends to let the gamer pay less for their titles. This comes from executive vice president Duncan Mac Naughton as he comments about their expectations that will see Walmart pay more for games, while customers pay less.

The company expect to take on all games for all existing console systems and Mac Naughton says “trade-in prices will, of course, vary depending on a title’s popularity,” even though he does expect the average price paid per game to be around $35.

Therefore, we can see this becoming even more advantageous for gamers looking to exchange, trade or buy used games.###1334||Symantec Corp.

Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $US10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $US400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley's most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney's office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $US10bn would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $US8.43bn, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $US9.39bn.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court has handed a defeat to a coalition of retail groups that challenged as too high the Federal Reserve’s cap on how much banks can charge businesses for handling debit card transactions.

The ruling issued Friday by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a lower court’s decision in July that favored the merchants and was a setback for banks.

In the July ruling, a federal judge struck down the Fed’s cap on so-called “swipe fees,” saying the Fed didn’t have the authority to set the limit the way it did in 2011, improperly including data that made the cap too high.

The retail groups had sued the Fed over its setting the cap at an average of about 24 cents per debit-card transaction. The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.

Congress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.

The retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.

The three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.

The National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.

“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”

The Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.

The banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Hunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed, but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”

“Make no doubt about it — consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.

The American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.

The fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.

Banks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.

Banks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.

The retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.

The Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, banks had negotiated such fees with merchants. A big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop because it handles more customers. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.

In addition to the National Retail Federation, the suit against the Fed was brought by the National Association of Convenience Stores; the National Restaurant Association; the Food Marketing Institute; Boscov’s Department Store, a chain of 40 stores based in Reading, Pa.; and Miller Oil Co. of Norfolk, Va., which operates convenience stores and gas stations.

Miller Oil has said it used to pay about 16 cents per transaction in debit swipe fees.

The Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.

Results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks’ financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year’s tests.

“The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago,” said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The banks’ stronger positions should enable them to pursue business plans, pay dividends to shareholders, raise capital from investors and expand services to customers, said Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment - now at 6.7 percent - would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests - even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks’ progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.

The 30 banks were also tested on how well they would withstand severe downturns in Europe and in Asian countries like China and Japan.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Nearly all U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in assets were in the group of 30 that were tested. Together they account for some $13.5 trillion in assets - about 80 percent of U.S. banks’ total amount. Twelve of the 30 banks were added to the testing roster for the first time this year.

Most of the 30 banks tested, along with hundreds of others, received federal bailouts during the financial crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.

Zions, the only bank to fall short this year, is based in Salt Lake City. It slid to a loss in the fourth quarter as it booked hefty charges related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items.

Zions said in a statement that its performance on the stress tests was worse than it expected mostly due to significantly higher commercial real estate losses, significantly greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue. The bank said that it will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Ally said it was pleased that the test results “recognized the substantial transformation that the company has undergone since last year.”

The Fed concluded last March that Wall Street powerhouses JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needed better plans for coping with a severe downturn and gave the banks until September to revise them. The two banks were allowed to increase their dividends and buy back their stock on condition they submitted revised capital plans that satisfied the Fed.

At the same time, the Fed approved requests outright from 14 of the 18 banks tested, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

But the Fed forbade Ally and BB&T; Corp. from making any dividend increases and share buybacks they may have been seeking.

Next Wednesday, the Fed will announce whether it has approved each bank’s request, if one has been made, to raise dividends for shareholders. Its decisions will be based on how each bank would fare in a severe recession if it increased its payout.

Raising dividends costs money. The government doesn’t want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.

The other banks tested were: American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Comerica Inc., Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp, M&T; Bank Corp., Northern Trust Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., Santander Holdings USA Inc., State Street Corp., U.S. Bancorp and UnionBanCal Corp.

MOSCOW, March 21 (RAPSI) – Visa and MasterCard payment systems on Friday blocked operations with SMP Bank owned by Russian businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenbergs added to a list of targeted economic sanctions by the United States on Thursday, according to the bank’s statement.

On Thursday, the Rotenberg brothers were included in the economic sanctions list imposed against Russian officials over the Ukrainian developments. Arkady Rotenberg heads SMP Bank’s board of directors, and owns a 38% share. A similar share is owned by his brother Boris Rotendberg.

The new sanctions were in response to a vote held Thursday in Russia’s parliament ratifying the reunification of Crimea with Russia after 60 years as part of Ukraine. A referendum in the region held Sunday saw voters overwhelmingly support leaving Ukraine and joining Russia.

Along with Rotenberg brothers, who are presumed to have close ties with Vladimir Putin, the sacntions were imposed against Andrei Fursenko, presidential aide; Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office; Sergei Mironov, Duma lawmaker and leader of A Just Russia party; Sergey Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian State Duma; and businessman Gennady Timchenko.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this month that sanctions against Russia threatened to cause mutual damage in the modern, integrated global economy.

The US and EU announced asset freezes and travel bans targeting a number of Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin on Monday, following Crimea’s referendum.

Crimea, previously an autonomous republic within Ukraine, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government in Kiev that came to power amid often violent protests last month and sought reunification with Russia.###1353||Reuters

Empty and full stations abound in this cash-strapped system.

Thursday was the first day of spring. According to Ed Rademaekers, it was also the worst day of the year for NotSpots in New York City. Rademaekers recently coined the term NotSpot to describe a Citi Bike station that's either completely empty or completely full. As of 10:30 a.m. on March 20, 63 of New York's 330 stations were NotSpots - 59 empty and four full. That's 19 percent of the stations in the system, meaning Rademaeker's NotSpot Index (tracked on bikeshareNYC) was in the red zone. The index goes from red down through yellow and green to blue, when less than 5 percent of the system is in NotSpot territory. Since Rademaekers launched his site in January, blue hasn't appeared much. Rademaeker's NotSpot Index



This imbalance is symptomatic of the larger challenges facing Citi Bike, the nation's largest bike-share system, which has proven hugely popular but is struggling financially. As detailed in an article in today's Wall Street Journal, software glitches and damage from Superstorm Sandy took an early financial toll on New York's bike-share. A tough winter resulted in a sharp drop in daily passes which provide much-needed revenue for the system. And though annual memberships have soared to 100,000, many think that they're underpriced at $95.

The plan was always for the system to be subsidized by sponsorships rather than city funds. But apart from the initial investments by Citibank and MasterCard, there have been no major takers. And new NYC DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg acknowledged earlier this month that Citi Bike faces "a number of financial and operational challenges" and that "all options are on the table," including user rate hikes, to bring in more cash. All those financial constraints led to layoffs over the winter, the Journal reports, which may account for situations like the one Rademaekers noted going into the first day of spring, when the 31-dock station at Allen Street and East Houston on the Lower East Side sat empty for 11 hours. Rademaekers is a retired journalist and big fan of bike-share. He splits his time between California and New York, and when he's in residence at his apartment in Lower Manhattan, he uses the system whenever he can. "I use it in place of the subway to do the errands that need to be done," says Rademaker. It didn’t take long for his annual membership to pay off. "I kept close track of times that I would have been on the subway," he says. "The 99 dollars paid for itself in three months." Like anyone who depends on bike-share for transportation, Rademaeker has experienced the sinking feeling you get when the station of your choice is empty, or worse, full. He started to get curious about the patterns of use, and what it would take to keep the system properly balanced.

Then Rademaekers stumbled upon the maps created by Oliver O’Brien at the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis in the United Kingdom. These wonderful visualizations use open data to track bike-share systems around the world. Now, every day, Rademaekers plugs the data from these maps into spreadsheets, creating a running graph of the availability of bikes. He has grown accustomed to the rhythm of the bikes as they move around, noting that the rush comes later than he would have expected, between 10:30 a.m. and noon. Balancing the number of bikes in the system is one of the primary headaches of any bike share, and New York has been no exception. "More bikes end up in one part of the city, and they don't walk themselves back," he says. That’s a crucial problem. Here's how Rademaekers puts it on his blog: We believe that the system has a decent chance to become as necessary a part of the public transit mix as a taxi or an A train. That can only happen if bicycles are consistently available in all served neighborhoods. And all served neighborhoods must be served equally. Right now, neither condition is being met. Speaking to the Journal, Caroline Samponaro, with the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives, said: "The bottom line is that New Yorkers deserve better ... The arc should be improving." Even before the winter and its discontents, balancing has been hard in New York. People were using the system in huge numbers almost immediately, and certain key points in the network were quickly overwhelmed. At Penn Station, as WNYC pointed out in their story about the problem last summer, truckloads of bikes were being brought back to the busy commuter hub twice during the course of a morning, but it still wasn't enough. (The station has its own nifty map showing usage patterns at individual stations.) "Rebalancing is an ongoing challenge for any successful bike share system," writes Dani Simons, director of marketing and external affairs for NYC Bike Share. As she explains: "With over six trips per bike per day on Citi Bikes during the warmer months, keeping the bikes and docking points available to our customer where and when they want them is always going to be tough. We are using data we collected last year to try to build better routing plans for our re-balances, staging bikes near some of our busiest locations (e.g. near Penn Station and the Lower East Side) and even experimenting with moving small numbers of bikes more quickly using bike trailers this spring." In a perfect world, every station would be half full and half empty, but Rademaekers recognizes just how complex the problem is. He’s hoping that his NotSpot index will provide a valuable way of visualizing the imbalances. "I don’t want to put myself out there as the decision-maker about what is an acceptable service level," he says. "But if the blog started that conversation, that would be great."###1354||PETALING JAYA: The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has encountered problems locating debris possibly related to missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH370 due to bad weather in the southern Indian Ocean.

Australian authorities revealed on Thursday that there was a possibility that debris spotted by satellite some 2,500km southwest of Perth may be related to the missing MH370.

At approximately 5.45pm, AMSA News twitter account posted an update stating that the Royal Australian Air Force P3 crew had been unable to locate the debris as clouds and rain had brought about limited visibility.

“RAAF P3 crew unable to locate debris. Cloud & rain limited visibility. Further aircraft to continue search for #MH370,” AMSA tweeted.

Of the two objects located in the Indian Ocean, the larger measured 24m. The basic dimensions of a Boeing 777-200ER are as follows: A wing span of 60.9m, an overall length of 63.7m, a tail height of 18.5m and a fuselage with a 6.19m diametre.

MH370, missing for 13 days now, carried 239 passengers and crew.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.

Late last year, Twitter announced the number of monthly active users was 284 million in the third quarter. That was up 13 million from the previous quarter. Investors’ response to the growth? Shares tanked 10%.

Today, Twitter announced two new features for its social media platform. Group messages and video sharing.

Now, you and 19 of your Twitter friends can take your conversation into private with Group Direct Messages. This might help people who don’t realize that racist tweet was public for everyone to see. And, it might save a job or two in the process.

The next feature should make investors happy. In-app video support.

You will be able capture, edit and share your videos from the Twitter app. Here’s how Twitter describes the new feature.

We designed our camera to be simple to use so you can capture and share life’s most interesting moments as they happen. In just a few taps you can add a video to unfolding conversations, share your perspective of a live event, and show your everyday moments instantly, without ever having to leave the app. Viewing and playing videos is just as simple: videos are previewed with a thumbnail and you can play them with just one tap.

Videos are limited to 30 seconds.

You can see it in action with this Neil Patrick Harris tweet.

Video support is an obvious addition for Twitter. Other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram already have it. Plus, it gives advertisers another way to reach Twitter users. You know it’s coming.

One question still remains. Will these features be enough for Twitter attract more user-growth to appease investors?

Their stock is down more than 3% right now, but that has more to do with the entire market falling than today’s announcement.###1357||Empty###1358||This Chinese satellite photo shows an object in the southern Indian Ocean that might be debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that disappeared with 239 people aboard in early March. This satellite photo was obtained by a Chinese Earth-observation satellite on March 18, 2014 and released by the country's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense on March 22.

A Chinese satellite orbiting Earth has captured a new photo of possible debris from the missing Malaysian Airlines jet that disappeared with 239 people aboard earlier this month.

The new Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released today (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The image shows a large object in the southern Indian Ocean, according to a translation of the image description.

SASTIND officials said the object is about 72 feet (22 meters) by 43 feet (13 m). It was spotted about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of the location of another possible debris sighting by an Australian satellite earlier this week, they added. [Facts about Malaysia Flight 370]

The new satellite photo is the latest clue in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 jet that disappeared on March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Since the disappearance, the search effort has focused on two vast arcs, one stretching north from Malaysia up toward Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and another stretching south across the Indian Ocean.

After an initial search of the potential debris location from the Australian satellite came up empty, search teams are now studying the Chinese satellite photo lead, according to press reports. Search and recovery ships are headed to the location to search for any debris, Malaysia Ministry of Defense officials said.

The Associated Press reported today that two Chinese military planes arrived in Perth, Australia to join Australian, U.S. and New Zealand aircraft in the search. Search flights on Saturday also yielded no signs of the missing jet, and it is unclear if the search area will be changed in the wake of the new Chinese satellite photo, the AP reported.

A search for a replacement is under way, it said.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman said in a prepared statement.

Symantec shares fell by nearly nine percent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq to $19.09 after having closed at $20.91 during the regular session. The shares have fallen by more than 14 percent since this time last year.

Bennett is a former CEO of Intuit and a veteran GE executive. He joined Symantec in 2012 at a time when the company was seen as a fading brand on both the consumer and enterprise security fronts.

His relatively short tenure as CEO will be best remembered for a series of corporate reorganizations. Last June he instituted a significant layoff of about 1,700 employees after announcing his intent to streamline the company into 10 operating units.

His plan had been to trim between $220 million and $250 million of Symantec’s annual operating budget, he said at the time. SEC filings show that as of the nine months ended December 27, Symantec’s operating costs had declined by $133 million. At that run rate, Bennett’s reductions would have amounted to about $178 million, well short of the goal he laid out last year. Restructuring charges in the first nine months of the year amounted to $237 million.

Bennett followed up on the layoffs by naming five new executives to help initiate what he described as a shift in direction and who would lead an effort to “drive innovative thinking.”

Symantec also reiterated its guidance for the quarter ending this month, saying that it expects revenue to decline by as much as 7.6 percent year on year to between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. It said it expects earnings per share on a GAAP basis to increase to between 29 cents and 31 cents a share, up from 27 cents in the year-ago period.

Brown, the interim CEO, joined Symantec’s board after it acquired the storage company Veritas in 2005. He was previously CEO of Quantum, a $6 billion storage hard drive manufacturer that was acquired by Maxtor in 2001, which was in turn acquired by Seagate Technology in 2005.###1362||Sally Beauty confirmed Monday that hackers broke into the supplier’s network, stealing the payment data of up to 25,000 customers.

The information stolen included payment card numbers and the three-digit security codes, known as CVV numbers, the company said. The retailer said it does not store customers’ personal identification numbers (PINs).

Customers will be notified if their information was stolen, said Sally Beauty, which is advising shoppers to check their bank statements for suspicious transactions. The company did not provide details on the nature of the breach, including whether it affected only shoppers who came into a store or also those who shopped online.

The confirmation follows a statement by Sally Beauty this month that said it detected a breach Feb. 24 but had no evidence that customers’ data had been stolen. The breach was first reported by security blogger Brian Krebs.

Krebs wrote that Sally Beauty probably had been attacked by the same hackers who stole more than 100 million customers’ data from Target.

Sally Beauty said that it was working with Verizon Enterprise Solutions and the Secret Service to investigate the breach.

“As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation,” the company said in a statement. “As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.”

A spokeswoman for Verizon Enterprise Solutions confirmed that the company was investigating the breach but did not provide details.

The attack makes Sally Beauty the latest retailer in the crosshairs of hackers. In addition to Target, Neiman Marcus and Michaels also suffered data breaches last year. The attacks have sparked debates in Washington on updating the nation’s breach notification laws and its payment systems.

Sally Beauty sells and distributes professional products in more than 2,700 stores across the country. The Texas-based company has $3.6 billion in annual revenue.###1363||Empty###1364||Print Article

In this Dec. 4, 2013, photo, Tracey Anderson, 26, re-stocks X-Box sets on opening day of a new Wal-Mart on Georgia Avenue Northwest in Washington.

NEW YORK - Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games, with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it's also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well," Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers."

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer's $55 used version.

"You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing," Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular "Gears of War" franchise, said last year###1365||Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service.

The stock is down 4% for three months, nearly 5% for the year to date and 7% since the beginning of December. Shares are currently at $74.75.

Even less attractive have been the images presented to TheStreet's readers by Rocco Pendola.

Walmart may not be able to exchange its image at the moment, but on Tuesday it announced you can now come in and exchange your used video games. This is a $2 billion industry that is currently dominated by, among others, GameStop (GME).



WATCH: Jim Cramer Prefers Take-Two, EA to Walmart and GameStop

Beginning March 26, Walmart customers may bring in used video games from popular consoles like Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox 360 and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation3. Customers will receive a store credit, which can be used at Walmart and Sam's Club stores.

Unlike similar trade-in programs, Walmart won't offer cash for the exchange at more than 3,100 stores, but customers can use the credit towards online Walmart purchases such as mobile devices. Walmart also plans to send those games traded in off for refurbishing and sold "like new."

If this sounds like a pawn shop, it's because pawn shops operate under a similar models. Blockbuster also tried this trade-in tactic and it failed. Both Amazon (AMZN) and Target (TGT) have begun playing this game.

But given Walmart's dominance across the U.S., there is a strong market for what the company might be able to produce, which will help revenue.

There may be an element of "so what" here. But before you knock this idea, consider that Wal-Mart posted $11.9 billion in revenue for all of 2013. The pre-owned gaming market is said to be a $2 billion industry, which represents 16% of Wal-Mart's annual revenue.

"This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities," Malaysia's transport ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

"Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

The source said the French image was captured Friday and was about 930-km north from where the Chinese and Australian objects were seen.

The official, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said one of the objects was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters by 13 meters.

The latest information was announced as planes and a ship scrambled to find a pallet and other debris in a remote patch of the Indian Ocean to determine whether the objects were from the jet that went missing for more than two weeks now.

Earlier on Sunday as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said there are credible leads in the case.

"Yesterday, one of our civilian search aircraft got visuals on a number of objects in a fairly small area in the overall Australian search zone," Abbott said.

The pallet was spotted by a search plane on Saturday, but has not been closely examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used on planes.

It is the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to run down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board.

Mike Barton, chief of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center, told reporters in Canberra, Australia, that the wooden pallet spotted by a civilian search aircraft was surrounded by several other nondescript objects, including what appeared to be strapping belts of different colors and lengths.

It was not immediately known if any pallets were used on Flight 370.

Several small objects were identified 2,500km off Australia's west coast, according to a statement released by the country's Maritime Safety Authority.

Sunday's search has been split into two areas, covering 59,000sq/km of ocean thousands of kilometres off the coast of Perth, the authority said.

Prayers for passengers

In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein put a message on his Twitter account Sunday asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.

More than 300 Malaysian cycling enthusiasts rode their bikes to the Kuala Lumpur airport to remember the people onboard the jet. The cyclists decorated the bikes with small Malaysian flags and stickers that read "Pray for MH370."

Beijing and Tokyo both sent two aircraft to join the six already involved in the operation backed by the US and New Zealand.

A total of 20 emergency service volunteers from western Australia will act as observers during Sunday's mission.

In Beijing, relatives of Chinese passengers, who are waiting for news about their missing plane, accused Malaysian officials of being "deceitful", adding that the meetings were a "waste of time," Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas reported.

Relatives said they feel Malaysian officials know more than they are saying, our correspondent added.

The Malaysian Airlines plane went missing three weeks ago.###1371||Empty###1372||Investment sentiment in Germany hit its lowest level in seven months in March amid uncertainty about the fallout for Europe's top economy from the crisis in Crimea, a survey found Tuesday.

The widely watched investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute fell by 9.1 points to 46.6 points in March, its lowest level since August 2013, it said in a statement.

"In this month's survey, the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW president Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk," Fuest said.

For the survey, ZEW questions analysts and institutional investors about their current assessment of the economic situation in Germany, as well as their expectations for the coming months.

The sub-index measuring financial market players' view of the current economic situation in Germany rose by 1.3 points to 51.3 points in March, its highest level since August 2011.

A frequent criticism of the ZEW index is that it can be volatile and is therefore not particularly reliable.###1373||The Telegraph is reporting that it has obtained the final 54 minutes of communication records from missing Malaysia Flight 370.

As the search continues for possible wreckage of the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, the transcript marks a further piece of evidence in the baffling mystery of flight MH370. It shows that -- according to numerous experts-- the two-way banter between Fariq Abdul Hamid, the co-pilot, and air traffic controllers was "perfectly routine."

The report focuses on two parts of the communication. During one portion, a message from the cockpit repeats that they were cruising at 35,000 feet. In another portion, the plane lost contact and changed direction just as there was a changeover among air traffic controllers, according to the UK paper.

But the run of messages between MH370 and the ground involved routine calls between the cockpit and air traffic controllers and gives no hint of the drama that was to follow. It is believed Hamid, as co-pilot, was the sole communicator.

An international search effort is underway to find the missing jetliner. There were 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board when the Boeing 777 lost contact on March 8. This week, the search has focused on a remote area of the Indian Ocean after two large objects, possibly debris, were spotted by a satellite.###1374||It just keeps getting worse for GameStop (NYSE:GME). Not only is it facing growing competition from its own suppliers, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE), but soon it will have to take on the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).

While Wal-Mart has been selling video games (both hardware and software) for years, the discount chain is about to challenge GameStop in an entirely new way: Later this month, Wal-Mart will begin dealing in used video games. While I wouldn't expect Wal-Mart's new initiative to obliterate GameStop's business overnight, it's only increasing the pressure on a retailer that's becoming less relevant by the day.

The looming threat of digital distribution

GameStop is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the S&P 500, with a short float near 30%. While different investors may be working from different theses, the larger case against GameStop primarily centers around the promise of digital distribution.

It's no secret that the video game industry is going digital. Like movies and music before them, video games are increasingly shifting from physical discs to digital downloads. Owners of Microsoft's and Sony's latest consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, can, if they so desire, deal exclusively in digital -- downloading all of their games directly from the companies' respective digital storefronts, something that couldn't be done with prior machines.

But there are still many reasons that gamers would prefer to own a physical copy, and so physical games live on for the time being. Some gamers lack the robust broadband connections required for large game downloads, while others may prefer to have a physical copy that they could sell or lend to a friend. These obstacles cannot be overlooked, but should be overcome in time.

For their part, both Microsoft and Sony are working hard to encourage gamers to embrace digital distribution. Microsoft has begun to offer aggressive discounts on digital versions of its games, a strategy that allowed Valve to dominate the PC gaming space. Sony has similar "flash" sales, but has taken it a step further.

This summer, Sony's "PlayStation Now" service will roll out to owners of its PlayStation 4 video game console, allowing them to stream digital versions of games directly over the Internet. It remains to be seen if the service will be successful, but if it catches on, it will pose an obvious threat, particularly if Sony can expand PlayStation Now to include newer titles.

While most sell-side analysts continue to downplay the threat posed by digital distribution, some of them have begun to come around. Last month, Longbow Research downgraded GameStop to underperform, citing the risks posed by digital distribution.

Wal-Mart comes after GameStop's core market

With its suppliers in open rebellion, GameStop's problems are about to intensify. Whatever market remains for used video games in the coming years, GameStop will have to share it with Wal-Mart. GameStop has a number of advantages over Wal-Mart -- a smaller, more focused operation; more knowledgeable employees; and its PowerUp Rewards program -- but Wal-Mart has advantages of its own.

Namely, Wal-Mart plans to offer traders general store credit -- meaning that a pile of old video games could be traded for a cart of groceries, a tank of gas, a new TV, or any of the tens of thousands of items Wal-Mart stocks. In contrast, video games traded in to GameStop can only become more games, video game-related hardware, or used mobile devices. (Admittedly, GameStop will pay cash, but far less than what it pays in credit.)

Given that used video game products account for about one-quarter of GameStop's revenue and almost half of its profit, Wal-Mart's entrance into the space cannot be discounted. Either GameStop will lose market share or it will be forced to work harder to retain its market, sacrificing margins in the process.###1375||Empty###1376||MOSCOW - Russian stocks tumbled Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin&39;s entourage.

Fears over Russia&39;s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday&39;s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin&39;s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support.

Putin&39;s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin&39;s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned

The MICEX benchmark was down nearly 3 percent two hours into Friday trading waith the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were taking a pounding, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury&39;s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them.

U.S. officials described Russia&39;s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them "without prior notification."

SMP&39;s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin - were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia&39;s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard&39;s actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won&39;t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops or online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

Russia&39;s central bank sought to assure that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. authorities "does not have a serious bearing on the lender&39;s financial stability."

However, it added that the government could "take necessary steps to support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor&39;s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded.

In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia&39;s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia&39;s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia&39;s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country&39;s borrowing costs more expensive.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

RUSSIA TO HOLD OFF ON RECIPROCAL SANCTIONS

Earlier on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would for now hold off on more reciprocal sanctions against the United States, after Washington introduced punitive measures against his close allies over the Ukraine crisis.

"You know, both in the first case -- the American sanctions -- and in the second case -- the introduction of a visa regime with Ukraine -- I think we should for now hold off on reciprocal steps," Putin told a meeting of his Security Council in comments released by the Kremlin.###1377||Empty###1378||Mulberry chief executive Bruno Guillon has stepped down from his role at the British luxury brand after two years.

If General Motors needs any more indication of how its own safety issues could play out, it need look no farther than Toyota.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Toyota will pay $1.2 billion to end a criminal probe into its handling of reports of unintended acceleration.

That's on top of millions of dollars in fines to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and class-action settlements.

General Motors is now under fire for deadly ignition switches in 1.6 million vehicles built in the middle of the last decade that are part of the worldwide recall announced last month. It's just starting the process.

Just as the Justice Department closes its criminal investigation of Toyota, it was disclosed last week that a new one is believed to be underway involving GM.

"The timing of this (Toyota) settlement is interesting because it means the government will finalizing the last major automotive recall, Toyota's unintended acceleration, just as it gears up for the next big recall related to GM's ignition switch," says Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, in a statement. "The cases are similar because they both involve a long, established history of vehicle incidents that took years to identify and address."

Just as Toyota's CEO was brought from Japan to testify to congressial committees, GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that it's "likely" she will be called to testify to congressional panels as well over the switch issue.

She says GM took too long to acknowledge a problem. She named a safety czar, just as Toyota did when it was under fire.

It's yet to be seen how the ignition switch issue will play out for GM. But its executives have to be paying close attention to Toyota's travails -- and be worried.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake - a total of more than 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

The coin will be announced as part of Chancellor Osborne's budget speech today.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell as much as 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company said the decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.''

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...,'' FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Symantec is facing stiff competition from nimbler network security software makers such as Palo Alto Networks and Checkpoint Systems.

"Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you just add this to the list,'' Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for the fourth quarter.

March 20 (Reuters) - Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said Thursday.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. (r.reuters.com/fup77v)

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley’s most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney’s office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10 billion would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39 billion.

Vermont's unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average - the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state's unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers - the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

"The January numbers start the year on a positive note," Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. "Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth."

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February's report is due out in late March.

One of Vermont's economic challenges is the size of the work force. With the exception of January's preliminary numbers, the labor force has dipped in recent years after decades of solid growth.

Moody's Investors Service named the downward trend in job growth as one of Vermont's primary credit challenges in its October 2013 assessment of the state's credit rating. The state's rapidly aging population - a major factor in the overall labor trends - also topped the list of negative credit factors.

The ratings agency's sister company, Moody's Analytics, credits the tourism and food processing industries with helping to keep the state's economy afloat in the short-term.

Seasonally adjusted state data show a 6.8 percent increase in leisure and hospitality jobs since January 2013: the arts, entertainment and recreation sector gained about 600 jobs. Accommodations and food services filled about 800 positions. Food manufacturing is also up.

Durable goods manufacturing led the seasonally adjusted declines in 2013, shedding 6.5 percent, or 1,400 jobs. Construction is also down, by about 2.1 percent, or 300 jobs, since last January.###1389||Empty###1390||The content you're looking for is no longer available.###1391||As Prime Minister Stephen Harper landed in the Netherlands ahead of a visit to Ukraine to meet with the country’s interim government this weekend, he announced a fresh expansion of sanctions against Russia.

Harper issued a statement Friday afternoon as he landed at The Hague announcing that Canada has imposed economic sanctions on 14 more Russian officials as well as Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based bank owned by supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Travel bans have also been imposed on the 14 individuals.

“Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty,” said Harper in the statement.

Friday’s announcement brings the total number of Ukrainian and Russian officials sanctioned by Canada to 41. The officials have been sanctioned for their connection to the invasion of Crimea nearly three weeks ago and orchestration of Sunday’s referendum that saw Crimeans vote for independence from Ukraine.

Bank Rossiya is the first financial institution to be sanctioned by Canada.

The punishments are part of Canada’s efforts to isolate Putin and his government. In addition to economic sanctions and travel bans, Canada has also broken military ties with Russia.

Along with its G7 partners, Canada has refused to recognize last weekend’s referendum in Crimea.

“The so-called referendum that was held has no legitimacy, and any additional escalations by Russia will lead to further isolation from the international community,” said Harper in the statement.

On Friday, NDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar called on the government to suspend military sales to Russia, following a similar move by Germany earlier this week. It is not known whether the Conservative government is on side with this idea.

Harper is the first G7 leader to visit the eastern European country since pro-Russian troops invaded Crimea. He will meet with Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird will also accompany the prime minister.

Following his visit to Ukraine, Harper will return to The Hague for the Nuclear Security Summit and an emergency meeting between G7 leaders. He will complete his trip with a visit to Germany, where he will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss a variety of bilateral issues.

The newly targeted individuals on Canada’s sanctions list are as follows:

– Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, Putin aide;

– Alexei Gromov, first deputy head of presidential administration;

– Sergei Ivanov, chief of staff to the presidential executive office;

– Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the Russian security council;

– Vladimir Igorevich Kozhin, Putin’s head of administration;

– Yuri Valentinovich Kovalchuk, largest single shareholder of Bank Rossiya and personal banker to senior officials;

– Sergey Yevgenyevich Naryshkin, chairman of the government Duma of the federal gathering of the Russian Federation;

– Lt.-Gen. Igor Dmitrievich Sergun, general staff chief of military intelligence

– Yury Viktorovich Ushakov, Putin foreign policy adviser;

– Vladimir Pligin, chairman of the Duma constitutional law committee;

– Arkadii Viktorovich Bakhin, first deputy defence minister;

– Mikhail Vitalevich Margelov, chairman of the federation council committee for foreign affairs;

– Vitalii Nikitich Ignatenko, first deputy chairman of the federation council committee for foreign affairs;

– Gennady Timchenko, one of the founders of the Gunvor, a major commodity trading company.

But analysts were buoyed by the numbers because they reflected positive economic movement.



“We know there were employers hiring only for the holiday season and that those workers have been laid off,” said Margie Genter, who oversees eight Goodwill Job Connection offices in Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee and DeSoto counties. “But we also know there are more jobs available, so that people who had given up their job search are coming back into the job market.”



Statistics released Monday by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity show that more people, encouraged by what they consider an improving labor market, have re-entered the job pool at a time when payroll positions also are on the rise.



At the end of January, the labor force in the three-county area was 385,813, up 3,754 workers from a month earlier.



At the same time, payrolls got a little bigger. The number of employed workers rose by 2,040, to 362,286.



Statewide, the department reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, down two-tenths of a point from a revised December rate of 6.3 percent and nearly 2 percentage points better than the 8 percent of a year earlier.



Florida, overall, has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That was third best in the nation, trailing just Texas and California, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.



In issuing figures for January, the state also revised its numbers for 2013, replacing rougher survey numbers with more accurate job counts.



That yearly process, called bench-marking, showed Florida payrolls at 7.68 million at year end, up 35,600 from an earlier estimate.



Economists were generally encouraged by the report.



“Two-thousand thirteen looked better than it did originally, as far as job creation,” said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida.



The year-end numbers “confirm our story line, which has been a positive outlook, a fairly strong rebound in Florida and in the Sarasota area as well,” said Mekael Teshome, an economist at PNC Financial Services who tracks Florida’s economy.



He said housing and consumer spending, which have led Florida’s recovery, should continue to do well.



“But we are now seeing more balanced growth, across industries both small and large,” Teshome said.



Demand for workers has continued to grow even as the statewide and regional unemployment rate has hovered around 6 percent for months.



“There has definitely been an upshift, a swing, where we are seeing more employers, even those we worked with in years past, come forward and start to hire,” said Jennifer Kochilaris, regional vice president for job placement firm Adecco USA. “That shows us the trend is continuing on the right path here in Sarasota.”



Manufacturing has been a bright spot for the region’s economy, as well.



“In this area, production is booming," said Nancee Sussman, who runs the Sarasota office of Swanson Staffing. “We are seeing them starting second and third shifts, which is good.”



Construction, too, has come back significantly.



Home builders are finding workers “are not available in this area in the quantities that we need,” said Alan Anderson, executive vice president of the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association. “Electricians, dry-wallers, HVAC, plumbers. There are some framing concerns as well.”



Local builders are having a tough time competing now with other markets nationally for skilled trades, especially because so many of those workers left the region during the housing crash, Anderson said.



Florida added 32,700 construction jobs in the 12 months ended in January, more than any other state, according to data released Monday by the Associated General Contractors of America.



But 37 other states grew their construction payrolls in the year’s first month as well, the association said.



“Especially considering the fact that many parts of the country experienced very harsh weather in January, these construction jobs figures are particularly robust,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist.



In Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties, more than 23,500 residents were looking for work in January, statistics show.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent, as compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County’s rate rose by a 0.5 percentage point to 6.2 percent, from 5.7 percent.



Manatee experienced the smallest increase and had the region’s lowest jobless rate in January: 5.9 percent, as compared with 5.8 percent in December.

EARLIER: The unemployment rate in Southwest Florida climbed nearly a half-percentage point during January to 6.1 percent, likely the result of job cuts following the holiday season and more workers looking for jobs.



Unemployed workers who are not actively looking for a job are not counted in the unemployment rate. That has been responsible for part of the significant decline in the jobless rate during the recovery from the Great Recession: discouraged workers who have given up.



But evidence that more workers might be looking was found in the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity's total work force count for the region released on Monday.



There were 385,813 people counted, up nearly 1 percent, or 3,754, from the same tally in December.



The state counted 23,527 workers looking for work in January for the 6.1 percent unemployment figure. The jobless rate was 5.7 percent during December.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County rate rose 0.5 percentage points to 6.2 percent from 5.7 percent.



Manatee saw the smallest increase and had the region's lowest jobless rate during January: 5.9 percent compared with 5.8 percent in December.###1396||Empty###1397||Why did this happen?

And it is hard to look at the pictures, ubiquitous this morning, without a disgracefully touchy-feely, yes, I fear, even protectively feminine response. Isn't it sweet? Doesn't it have something perfectly reflective of our quirky national identity that the present pound coin roundly lacks?

Resurrecting the shape of the old threepenny bit is a stroke of genius. Note the universally positive reaction. Note, too, how uniformly well-schooled the broadcasters were in pronouncing it "thrupenny" as of old. The PR pack must have come with a pronunciation guide.

Hold on a moment, though. Is it not budget day? Why on earth launch a showy new pound coin with so much fanfare, when the real news is supposed to be the UK's superb growth projections, absurdly generous new subsidies for childcare and a thoroughly welcome rise in the income tax threshold, courtesy of Nick Clegg?

Seen in this light, the new threepenny-style pound coin looks suspiciously like a diversion. What giant new claim on our fast-depleting personal wealth is the chancellor going to spring on us that requires such an elaborate ploy? There's something disconcertingly April-foolish about it.

The official reason for introducing a new pound coin now is the estimated 45 million or so counterfeit ones that are in circulation. The old pound coin, as we must soon call it, was too simple to reproduce; a dodecagon represents a whole new challenge. Some, though, detect a different intention. The old pound, they suggest, looked too much like a euro coin for today's Eurosceptic sensibility. Nice timing, of course, in the run-up to EU parliamentary elections: Nigel Farage marshals his Ukip troops beneath his banner of limiting EU migration, while the Conservatives open their campaign meetings by flipping their new nationalist coin.

In another adroit piece of PR, there's to be a competition for the design of the non-Queen side. Public engagement is always a good idea. The one symbol likely to be ruled out, I imagine, is the thistle. Just in case.

Yet all enthusiasm for the new pound has tended to obscure some practical points. While the Royal Mint assures us that replacing one coin with another is not as expensive as we might think, this may be because much of the additional bill – £45m as someone estimated on Radio 4's Today programme (which eerily recalls the number of counterfeit pounds thought to be in circulation) – will, it seems, be paid by business, and by us.

A significant extra cost will be the replacement, or adaptation, of everything that requires pound coins at present. From luggage trolleys at airport and stations, to machines at the laundrette, to supermarket trolleys and slot machines providing everything from fizzy drinks to condoms. You also have to wonder how smoothly a 12-sided coin will be able to slip down its slot. One solution might be for the government to accelerate the withdrawal of the old coins as legal tender and have them sold back to us as tokens.

There is, though, a possible benefit from this change. Feeding pound coins into those super-fast gambling machines might seem more like spending real money than it does at present, and the new coins might periodically get stuck. Could it be that this has already been factored into the equation? As well as getting a patriotic rush from our new pound, we are to be saved from ourselves by other, stealthier, means.###1399||Empty###1400||Empty###1401||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

However, the social media giant offered an alternative way for Turkish users to send Tweets, wrote VentureBeat.

Twitter's instruction for the SMS workaround reads: "Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555."

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had earlier threatened to "wipe out" all social media networks in the country. He said this in response to Twitter and YouTube posts that linked him to a corruption issue. The incident has now become a hot topic as the country approaches the March 30 election, TechCrunch explained.

In 2011, Twitter was blocked in Egypt in connection with political issues. The social media site was also involved in a similar situation in Pakistan in 2012 and another one in China in 2009. Additionally, the French government has been struggling with the influence that the network has on its citizens and is working on gaining authority to take down posts that violate the country's laws, the report detailed.###1403||The French satellite image is the third set of images related to possible debris from the Malaysian flight 370, and giving searchers and officials more hope of answering questions relating to the world’s great aviation mystery.

France issued new satellite images on Sunday which show possible debris from the missing Boeing 777, Malaysian officials said, as searchers are presently combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, trying to locate the debris.

The images given to searchers in Australia “show potential objects” in the same part of the ocean where previous satellite images released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement.

Malaysia Airlines MH370 search: French satellite images provide more hope http://t.co/oIUAU5Baqe pic.twitter.com/XLOyGca0GD — CBC News (@CBCNews) March 23, 2014

The latest image seems to be another possible clue in the mysterious and futile search for the aircraft that went missing March 8, less than an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

In response to the newly released images from France, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said, “any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans.”

One of the objects in the French images was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite. But officials said the French satellite image was unclear and fuzzy, making it difficult to determine precise dimensions.

Ships have been sent in to try to locate a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colors. It was spotted Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.

“So, we’ve gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it,” said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s rescue coordination center. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

“The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the aircraft industry. They are usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft but within that container it is quite common to have items on pallets.” Barton said.

“It’s a possible lead but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well,” Barton said.

The images are reinforcing proof for the massive hunt for these objects, which has been underway since Friday. However, authorities are finding the remoteness of the search area, as well as weather, one of the biggest challenges.

“At 2500 kilometres (1,500 miles) away, they are operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area and back again so that’s only allowing us to get in a [single] search a day, which is again spreading the search over several days,” Barton said.

(NYSE: LNKD) CEO Jeff Weiner received the top grade in Glassdoor’s new “Highest Rated CEOs 2014.” The rating is based on employee answers to the question, “Do you approve of the way your CEO is leading your company?” LinkedIn has been one of the hottest public corporations traded on any U.S. exchange, both in terms of earnings and a stock price that has risen more than 100% during the past two years. Interestingly, company founders took many spots on the list.

At the top of the list are chief executives from both new and old economy companies. Alan Mulally of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), widely lauded for turning around the company, ranked second. Ford was the only one of the Big Three automakers that did not file for Chapter 11 during the recession, and as such did not take any federal bailout money.

Third on the list is Richard W. Edelman, who runs the PR firm founder by his father.

Fourth on the list is Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), a major provider of technology for smartphones. He is now the company’s executive chairman, having given up the CEO role to one of the firm’s veterans, Steve Mollenkopf. Jacobs’ father founded the firm.

Fifth on the list is Craig Jelinek of brick-and-mortar retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST), often cited as one of America’s best run retailers. He is followed by Brad Smith of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS).

The final three of the top 10 are Howard D. Schultz of Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX), another brick-and-mortar company; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), which is now one of the largest public corporations based on market cap, despite its modest revenue; and Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) CEO Larry Page. Page and Zuckerberg are also founders.

The extent to which old economy companies have a major presence on the list is because included among the top 50 are Edward C. “Ned” Johnson III of Fidelity, another family controlled firm; Mickey Drexler of brick-and-mortar retailer J. Crew; Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX); Bob Iger of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS); and Blake W. Nordstrom, part of the founding family of brick-and-mortar retailer Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN).

Among new economy CEOs, Tim Cook of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) made the list, as did Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO).

Retail CEOs dominated much of the list, a surprise because these companies often are ranked low in customer service polls. Their employees must believe otherwise. Hubert Joly of troubled electronics retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) is on the list, as is Frank Blake of Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD), Glenn K. Murphy of Gap Inc.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates ELECTRONIC ARTS INC as a "hold" with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate ELECTRONIC ARTS INC (EA) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income and disappointing return on equity."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:



Compared to its closing price of one year ago, EA's share price has jumped by 56.86%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Although EA had significant growth over the past year, our hold rating indicates that we do not recommend additional investment in this stock at the current time.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 88.70% to $685.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -0.21%.

ELECTRONIC ARTS INC has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC increased its bottom line by earning $0.32 versus $0.21 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.31 versus $0.32).

Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Software industry and the overall market, ELECTRONIC ARTS INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.

The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Software industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 584.4% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$45.00 million to -$308.00 million.

By Gerry Shih and Alexei Oreskovic

SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s abrupt ban on Twitter Inc stirred concerns on Friday that the country may pull the plug on other social media and Internet services as it grapples with internal turmoil.

Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has in the past threatened to block Facebook Inc and Google Inc’s YouTube as well, though both remained online.

YouTube rejected requests by the Turkish government in recent weeks to block certain videos, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, citing anonymous sources. Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter’s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.

YouTube did not return requests for comment.

Twitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country’s government.

The ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.

For Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.

Analysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company’s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.

While Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey’s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“It’s a democracy, that’s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,” said York. “That could set a dangerous precedent.”

“I do think there’s a risk democracies could do this,” she added. “I don’t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site. I think instead what we’ll see is more pressure being put on Twitter to block certain content.”

Wall Street remains more focused on Twitter’s overall growth prospects and its budding advertising business, with Twitter’s stock finishing Friday’s regular trading session up 1.6 percent at $50.92 despite the situation in Turkey.

“If it does have any ripple effects, then obviously we would be concerned, but at this point I think it’s isolated,” said Arvind Bhatia of Stern, Agee & Leach.

But he noted that Twitter does have more political risk than other social media companies such as Facebook Inc, where messages tend to be shared among private groups rather than posted to the general public. Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.

Twitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.

A court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

The order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.

Industry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.

A Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.

Twitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

The clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter’s free-speech principles.

Because of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumors) can spread exponentially through “retweets,” Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.

Twitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.

The Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009. Twitter downplayed the likelihood of opening an office in the world’s largest Internet market, but the visit highlighted the tension between Twitter’s values and its business objectives.

BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina currently has an annual production capacity of around 350,000 and makes sport utility vehicles, including the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models.

"The U.S. will stay a market with great potential for us. This is why we are evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity in the U.S.", Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company's annual results press conference.

Investments made at plants in China will allow BMW to raise production capacity there to 400,000 cars, from 300,000 in 2013.

The Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands reiterated it aims to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

"We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions," Reithofer said.

Last week, BMW reported its automotive division's fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

The forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014, and on a steady recovery in European markets, BMW said.

BMW expects significant growth in markets outside of Europe including high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in China.

Analysts welcomed the positive outlook.

"We see BMW's confidence as a major positive trigger for the stock," analysts at ISI Global said in a note on Wednesday.

At 0950 GMT, BMW shares were up 5.1 percent at 84.88 euros.

BMW said it expected sales in the second half of 2014 to be higher than in the first six months as a result of a large number of model launches, including of the compact 2-series coupe and the 2-series Active Tourer.

Three top Democrats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives yesterday requested Gilead Sciences CEO John C. Martin Ph.D. give them “a briefing” on the pricing of the company’s new chronic Hepatitis C virus treatment Sovaldi™ (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, complaining about “the extraordinary high cost of your drug.”

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the three Democrats said in a letter to Dr. Martin. The three are Henry A. Waxman (D-CA), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce; Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), ranking member of the panel’s Subcommittee on Health; and Diana DeGette (D-CO), ranking member of the committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

They cited news reports that Gilead plans to charge $84,000 per 12-week treatment for Sovaldi, which won FDA approval in December after six months. That cost could nearly double when Sovaldi is combined with other drugs, the House Democrats said.

“These costs are likely to be too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and those with private insurance,” Reps. Waxman, Pallone and DeGette wrote.

Gilead has noted that the cost of the drug is lower than the cost of complications associated with hepatitis C treatment, such as liver damage or liver failure: “In our conversations with payers, pricing is a consideration, but efficacy, safety and treatment guidelines are equally important,” Gilead COO John Milligan told Bloomberg in January.

Sovaldi is a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor designed to block a specific protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Sovaldi is the first drug that has shown the safety and efficacy to treat certain types of HCV infection without the need for injection of interferon at the same time.

Sovaldi won FDA’s priority review and breakthrough therapy designations, granted to investigational medicines deemed to offer major advances in treatment over existing options.

“It is our hope that Sovaldi will mark the beginning of a new era in hepatitis C treatment,” Dr. Martin declared at the time in a statement.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court has handed a defeat to a coalition of retail groups that challenged as too high the Federal Reserve’s cap on how much banks can charge businesses for handling debit card transactions.

The ruling issued Friday by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a lower court’s decision in July that favored the merchants and was a setback for banks.

In the July ruling, a federal judge struck down the Fed’s cap on so-called “swipe fees,” saying the Fed didn’t have the authority to set the limit the way it did in 2011, improperly including data that made the cap too high.

The retail groups had sued the Fed over its setting the cap at an average of about 24 cents per debit-card transaction. The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.

Congress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.

The retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.

The three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.

The National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.

“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”

The Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.

The banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Hunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed, but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”

“Make no doubt about it — consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.

The American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.

The fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.

Banks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.

Banks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.

The retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.

The Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, banks had negotiated such fees with merchants. A big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop because it handles more customers. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.

In addition to the National Retail Federation, the suit against the Fed was brought by the National Association of Convenience Stores; the National Restaurant Association; the Food Marketing Institute; Boscov’s Department Store, a chain of 40 stores based in Reading, Pa.; and Miller Oil Co. of Norfolk, Va., which operates convenience stores and gas stations.

Miller Oil has said it used to pay about 16 cents per transaction in debit swipe fees.

The Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.

Such sanctions should primarily target Mr. Putin’s inner circle, the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation’s wealth, including Gennady N. Timchenko, head of the Volga Group; Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, influential businessmen and former judo sparring partners of Mr. Putin; Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a financier believed to be Mr. Putin’s banker; Vladimir I. Yakunin, president of Russian Railways; the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively.

Apparently the call to action was heard, and the US is attempting to ratchet up pressure on Putin’s real inner circle. Today, some but not all of these names—Timchenko, the Rotenbergs, Kovalchuk, and Yakunin—have been added to the list of people who cannot travel or transact business in the United States. A spokesman for Timchenko’s oil-trading firm, Gunvor, told Quartz “it is clear no due diligence was performed to support this accusation,” and said that Putin has never been a beneficiary of the firm or its activities.

Kovalchuk’s financial institution, Bank Rossiya, also made the list. Mark Dubowitz, one of the architects of the Obama administration’s Iran sanctions, recently told Quartz that crippling a single Russian financial institution by cutting it off from international transactions would be a key symbol—”the ‘kill the chicken to scare the monkeys’ theory of financial sanctions.” NPR’s former Moscow correspondent, Gregory Feifer, describes Bank Rossiya, the chicken in question, in his recent book:

The deeply obscure but hugely powerful Bank Rossiya … has been accused of using secret offshore companies to channel state loans intended for the acquisition of a jaw-dropping collection of Gazprom assets. Former bank insiders have said shady privatizations of companies such as Gazporm’s Sogaz insurance firm enabled Bank Rossiya to suck billions of dollars’ worth of value from the parent company. Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who is a keen observer of the hidden aspects of Russia’s economy, says the Putin circle’s “sheer asset-stripping” includes huge capital expenditures—$52 billion in 2011—on pipelines and other projects that cost far more than they would in other countries because much of the money is skimmed off.

The logic behind the sanctions is to squeeze the people who have benefitted from Putin’s reign. That is likely to be more effective than sanctioning Russian politicians who may not even have international financial interests. But by holding off on sanctioning Usmanov and the leaders of Russia’s two state-controlled oil firms, the US might be once again failing to send a strong enough message. Either that, or leaving itself room to escalate.###1426||Empty###1427||Empty###1428||Top Company Interviews

ANKARA - Anadolu Agency does not verify these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

Turkish dailies on Friday covered Thursday’s attack on Turkish security forces in central Turkey, which killed three people including a police officer and a soldier.

HURRIYET headlined “Assassination team,” claiming three gunmen, who departed from the southern province of Hatay, were heading to Istanbul to attack critical targets. They mounted an assault on Turkish soldiers when they were caught during a routine check on a highway in Nigde province. A police officer, a soldier and a civilian were killed while five others were wounded.

“Assad terror in Nigde,” headlined TURKIYE, commenting that the Turkish army prevented a possible attack masterminded by the Syrian regime. The newspaper reported that two "terrorists" were captured by the police, while one of them succeeded in fleeing.

Daily VATAN said two Al Qaeda-affiliated gunmen were caught at the hospital while carrying German passports.

Turkish dailies also covered the block implemented late Thursday on access to social media website Twitter, hours after Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of such an action.

Daily RADIKAL cited Turkish PM Erdogan saying at a local election rally on Thursday, “The court took the decision. I am not interested in what the international community say, we will wipe out Twitter.”

"Twitter was blocked at midnight," carries daily HURRIYET’s headline.

Daily TURKIYE also covered Erdogan’s rally in Bursa, recounting Erdogan's remarks that Turkey faces "international conspiracies" on social media and Twitter will be "eradicated."

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday that the program would begin on Wednesday, March 26. The retail giant said customers can trade in old video games in exchange for gift cards applicable towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, both in stores or online. The program will be available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores in the U.S. and will accept games from the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft (MSFT) XBox 360.

The move could prove extremely problematic for GameStop, which uses a trade-in program as a key part of its business strategy in its nearly 6,500 stores. The company reported in its third-quarter results in January that pre-owned sales increased 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, which accounted for 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also expects gross margins for the pre-owned category in the range of 46% to 49% for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year.

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

TheStreet Ratings team rates GAMESTOP CORP as a "buy" with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate GAMESTOP CORP (GME) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, reasonable valuation levels, good cash flow from operations and compelling growth in net income. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 7.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 18.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

Powered by its strong earnings growth of 111.41% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 44.71% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, GME should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Specialty Retail industry. The net income increased by 111.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from -$624.30 million to $68.60 million.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 80.29% to $680.60 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, GAMESTOP CORP has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -19.02%.

Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy this month after it said it lost 750,000 of its users currency, just reported that it found 200,000 bitcoins that were found in an “old-format wallet.”

For you kids at home dealing in old school, E Pluribus Unum kinda legal tender, that’s referring to a digital storage file kind of wallet, not the old leathery kind.

In a message posted Friday on the exchange’s website, Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said ”Mt. Gox Co., Ltd. had certain old­format wallets which were used in the past and which, Mt. Gox thought no longer held any bitcoins.”

But on March 7, Karpeles wrote, the exchange “confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC.” That still doesn’t account for all of the amount that was unaccounted for, plus another 100,000 of Mt. Gox’s own bitcoin reserve. Total value at the time: $450 million. Based on current rates, it is worth about a quarter of that.

Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, told The New York Times that Mt. Gox probably overestimated how much bitcoin it had misplaced.

“I think that it’s yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was,” said Luria, who has written about bitcoin. “That you can lose that much bitcoin and then find it tells you that we’re not talking about robust levels of security and control.”###1437||Zions Bancorporation (ZION) announced that, based upon an initial review of the Federal Reserve's publication, Zions' DFAST results were worse than Zions had projected. As a result of the Federal Reserve's stress tests, Zions will resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.

The company said it fell below the main capital threshold in the Federal Reserve's stress test because of greater real estate losses and risk-weighted assets, and lower revenue estimates.

The central bank determined the bank had significantly higher commercial real estate losses and Significantly greater risk-weighted assets. Regulators also found that the bank would have lower pretax, pre-provision net revenue under economic distress, according to the statement.

Zions also noted that its original submission to the Federal Reserve occurred prior to the sale of certain collateralized debt obligation securities in January and February 2014, which sales also resulted in a substantial reduction in risk.

Business News###1438||Security software maker Symantec has terminated the services of its President and CEO Steve Bennett. Reuters

Security software maker Symantec has terminated the services of its President and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such decision by the company in a span of two years.

The company, however, did not disclose the reasons for the move.

Symantec has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO with immediate effect.

"This appointment follows the termination of Steve Bennett as the company's president and CEO and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors," Symantec said in a statement.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, it added.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman Daniel Schulman said.

Bennett was roped in to head the US-based firm in July 2012 when its then President and CEO Enrique Salem was asked to leave the company after a 19 year association with Symantec, including three years as the CEO.

"It was the board's judgement that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO," Symantec had said.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with VERITAS Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation.

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

He will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its compensation and leadership development committee or nominating and governance committee.

Board member Robert S Miller will replace Brown as the chair of the compensation and leadership development committee.###1439||Empty###1440||Empty###1441||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Security software developer Symantec Corp. gave the boot to Chief Executive Steve Bennett as the company’s turnaround appears to be taking longer than expected.

In a statement earlier on Thursday, Symantec did not offer much of an explanation.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec,” board chairman Daniel Schulman said. “We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.” He added that the decision “was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

Symantec Outgoing Symantec CEO Steve Bennett.

Two and a half weeks ago, Bennett, who was appointed CEO in July 2012, told a Morgan Stanley Technology Conference that he planned to tell the board at an upcoming retreat that the company’s turnaround targets were still “very doable.” Perhaps the board thinks Symantec SYMC, +2.67% should be hitting its targets sooner.

“We’re going to have a tough year on margin expansion next year and revenue growth just [because of] the economics of the model, but we’re very excited about 2016 and 2017,” Bennett said earlier this month. He will be replaced on an interim basis by board member Michael Brown.

The developer of such products as Norton Antivirus software has been hit hard by the PC market’s steady decline. It has also struggled with a shift in the software industry to software as a service, or to a subscription model, versus the one-time licensing cost. Symantec will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results May 7.

Bennett had told the Morgan Stanley conference that the only way the company could meet the current profit margin target was through more cost cuts. “We took out about $200 million this year. I’m not going to do that again next year.”

Sounds like there might have been some disagreement about strategy or his approach to the turnaround. But will another CEO be able to move any faster without making more big cuts as well?

Investors were not pleased with the news, driving Symantec’s shares down over 6%.

Brussels - EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord Thursday on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy. Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People's Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP's Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the eurozone's 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long.

AFP###1443||Empty###1444||Walmart’s slogan is “Save Money. Live Better” and the new online shopping tool will allow customers to do just that by seeing the competitors price before they purchase an item online.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt.

Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. For example, in Atlanta, Walmart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General.

Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. They can redeem in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Shoppers compare competitor prices so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Walmart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Walmart has a long history of undercutting competitors prices, this move could not only change the way people shop, but also how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart said it wants to see how competitors and customers respond to the program, but it doesn’t have any plans to add online stores to the test.

Walmart built its business on offering lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Walmart’s “every day low price” model is under attack from dollar stores and grocery stores like Kroger in addition to the Amazons of the world. On top of that, the retailer’s primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

The companies U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer’s health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

The fresh idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Walmart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. Last month, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don’t feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

The company declined to say when the program could be expanded nationally.

That was the happy result for nearly every financial institution that underwent the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress tests, the key results of which were released yesterday. Essentially, the tests are a series of measurements gauging how the selected companies would perform financially under a set of increasingly dire economic circumstances.

If the results are any indication, they'd do just fine. Of the 30 institutions in the Fed's examination room (up from 18 last year), only a single one -- Utah-based regional lender Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) -- would lack the capital to survive the Fed's worst-case economic scenario.

This, of course, provides hope that the more high-profile financials on the market will have scope to raise their dividends and/or share buyback programs. This will be determined when the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (yeah, try saying that ten times fast) is released next Wednesday afternoon by the Fed. This is the second and perhaps more critical part of the tests, as it will include the Fed's approvals (or lack thereof) to the banks' capital distribution plans.

Two lenders busy biting their nails and pacing the room in anticipation are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Investors in the two incumbents are starving for an increase in their quarterly dividends, which have stood at $0.01 per share for both firms for longer than anyone cares to remember. The chances are higher for Bank of America to get the nod for such increases, as it had an excellent year in 2013 and continues to thrive. Citigroup is doing better than it has in some time, but still has some fat to shed before it can return to meaningful growth and profitability.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is in the Bank of America club of 2013 overachievers. Although it's been struggling with a slowdown in the mortgage market of late, it's still very far in the black in terms of bottom line and the market remains quite bullish on its prospects. The company has admitted that it is seeking hikes in both its dividend and its share repurchase program; at this point, it'd be surprising if the Fed said no to either.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), for one, will have a few more coins to hand out in dividends or buybacks (assuming, of course, that it's requested a lift in either and the Fed turns on the green light). The bank finally sold its physical commodities trading unit, nearly a year after announcing it was "pursuing strategic alternatives" for the division. The buyer is Switzerland-based Mercuria Energy Group, and the price is $3.5 billion.

This weekend will be a long one for the banks. CCAR Wednesday can't come fast enough. When it does, though, expect at least a few lenders to pop open the Champagne and get good and drunk; at least a few of them should have something to celebrate.###1448||Eric Hutchinson's goals as CEO of Spirent are nothing if not ambitious. He is seeking to not only move the long-time testing and assurance vendor into a new strategic ...###1449||The Federal Reserve on Friday released the results of this year’s annual Dodd-Frank Act stress test (DFAST), which evaluates the capital of the country’s top 30 banks and measures their ability to continue lending during an economic downturn. The scenario analytics tests were designed to determine if the financial institutions would be able to withstand dire conditions such as a severe drop in housing prices, 11.25 percent unemployment, as well as equity prices overall dwindling by half.

As expected, 29 of the 30 banks tested passed the first round of the Fed’s annual examination of their financial health and stability. These marks were awarded despite this year’s significant new changes that made the rigorous process more complex than in the past. For the first time, 12 medium-sized banks were evaluated along with the larger institutions, as well as the introduction of the Fed’s “severely adverse” and litigation scenarios to determine whether the top six banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs) could handle extreme domestic and international situations.

While the Fed speculated that the banks overall would lose $501 billion if faced with a severe recession and $355 billion in a less dire situation, they also concluded that the system overall is healthier and better equipped to handle a catastrophe than it was five years ago, when testing began. The only institution to fail the DFAST was Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City, falling below the 5 percent minimum Tier 1 threshold at 3.5 percent.

This was not a surprise, as the lender had already indicated that it would be resubmitting its 2014 capital plan for evaluation. All the other banks that were examined exceeded the Fed’s standards, paving the way to allow the institutions to pay back investors. Of the large banks, the top performers were New York Mellon and State Street, while the lowest ranked were Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Bank of America. Bank of America had the worst outcome of the large banks, just passing at 6 percent.

The results announced Friday were the first of two reports that will be released this month, with the more uncertain Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) outcomes expected March 26. While high marks on the DFAST signifies a bank’s ability to stay afloat, the CCAR evaluates each bank’s capital plan and its ability to be both profitable and maintain dividends during an uncertain economic outlook.

Each bank’s CCAR standards are individualized according to the institution’s balance sheet, risks, and assets, as well as its ability to pay excess capital to investors under the same adverse scenarios as put forth in the DFAST. Only after passing both tests will the Fed permit the banks to pay their investors almost $75 billion of excess capital in the form of dividend and buybacks that have accrued since 2009. Needless to say, it’s the CCAR results that the market is anticipating more.

Although Friday’s news held no surprises, next week’s results are somewhat more uncertain. There will be a greater focus on the lowest-ranking institutions, especially JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which each had to resubmit their capital plans last year. Insiders will also be paying attention to Citi’s CCAR results due to its low marks, at 7 percent, as well as February’s discovery of $360 million lost due to receivables fraud by a Mexican subsidiary, which forced Citi to resubmit its fourth-quarter financials.

More From Wall St. Cheat Sheet:###1450||Computer security company Symantec has fired its second CEO in less than two years, with the dismissal of Steve Bennett in the wake of drooping revenue and falling shares.

Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as CEO in July 2012, with the goal of positioning Symantec to compete with a new generation of security companies, The Wall Street Journal reported.

However, Bennett had reportedly yet to deliver on new products.

"We weren’t making enough progress in product innovation," The Wall Street Journal reported a person close to the board as having said. "We were not seeing revenue growth."

Symantec has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO as it begins its search for a permanent CEO.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth," company chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Schulman also acknowledged the work Bennett has done for the company.

"We recognise Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organisational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," Schulman said.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5pc organic revenue growth and better-than 30pc non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

Symantec’s revenue sank 4.8pc to US$1.7bn in the period ended 27 December. Yesterday, the company said revenue in the current quarter would amount to US$1.62bn to US$1.66bn, down from US$1.75bn a year earlier. Shares fell nearly 7pc in after-hours trading yesterday. Previously, they were down nearly 15pc over the past 12 months.###1451||So, you thought the messaging mania would go away after Facebook bought What’sApp?

LOL.

There’s still more money – lots of it – flying around Silicon Valley aimed at those who text and send songs to each other. The latest jaw-dropping deal brings a $280 million funding round to Mountain View’s Tango. Tango is a messaging app, getting more sticky by the day as users play games and send photos and songs to each other. It’s got more than 200 million users worldwide to go with all that cash.

The funding round, led by China’s soon-to-IPO Alibaba (talk about a company about to come into some money…), will bring lots of growth to Tango.

Co-Founder Eric Setton, in an interview at company HQ, told NBC Bay Area “we're looking to make progress in terms of staffing...and add here in Mountain View as well as Beijing, China, where we have offices.”

International growth, for a company that has big growth plans.

But is all this money (for texting apps!) a sign of another bubble? Santa Clara University Business professor Robert Hendershott says maybe. Admitting that it’s crazy money flying around the Valley, he admits that this could also be a time for huge growth and innovation in tech, and that takes money. However, he says “when we start seeing Super Bowl commercials for texting apps, we’ll know we’re in a bubble.”

So, stay on the small screens, and we should be OK. As long as those millions and millions of people keep texting and buying.

Scott is on Twitter: @scottbudman###1452||Empty###1453||US stocks were sent lower yesterday thanks to Yellen's suggestion that the Fed may start to hike interest rates as early as April 2015. No exact timeline was given, but the Fed's Chairman wasn't coy when asked how long the Fed would wait until after the QE tapering ends before they start to raise interest rates. Instead of reverting to type and say generic terms, Yellen actually quantified the period to "around six months" even though she wasn't pressed to give a more specific time frame. Assuming that Fed continues to cut QE purchases by $10 Billion each in the next 5 meetings, we would reach the end of QE in October, that would mean the 1st rate hike may happen during the 2015 April meeting. If the pace of decline in QE is faster, and if Yellen's 6 months is relatively flexible we could even see a rate hike at the end of 2014 or at the start of 2015. No matter how you cut it, this new guidance is earlier than the previous estimate of mid 2015.

Hence, it is not surprising to see Stock prices tanking lower heavily following this news, as market has been heavily doped up by hyper-low interest rates and the prospect of higher borrowing costs will affect traders who are using high leverage right now - and they represent a large proportion of the market if record margin debt levels shown in US exchanges are anything to go by.

Hourly Chart

S&P 500 Hourly



However, prices did not really drop that significantly. S&P 500 only shed 0.61%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower by 0.70%, while Nasdaq 100 fell by 0.64%. This is by no means the largest decline that we've seen in recent days, and the failure of risk sensitive Nasdaq 100 to fall the greatest suggest that risk appetite hasn't really disintegrated. From a price action perspective, S&P 500 remains above the 1,850 key support, and seeing how prices rebounded quickly when 1,850 was tagged, it is clear that there are bulls seeking bargain buys which will keep prices supported for now.

That being said, the failure to climb above 1,860 resistance is worrying, and right now prices are starting to head lower once again - in line with Asian stocks that are bearish right now. This suggest that a move back towards 1,850 is possible once again, but breaking below may be difficult considering that Stochastic readings should be Oversold when 1,850 is reached. Nonetheless, the support level is not invincible and should risk off appetite spread to the European session and back to US session once again it is possible for prices to go all the way back to last week's low.

Daily Chart

S&P 500 Daily

The same could be said for Daily Chart. Uptrend is still in play, echoed by Stochastic curve that is pointing higher right now. However, Stoch levels are at a "resistance zone" between 50.0 - 60.0 and it is still possible for Stoch curve to reverse here. Hence, traders who wants to play on the rebound should wait for stronger confirmation that 1,850 has held before committing heavily.

On the fundamentals side of things, it should be noted that for all the panic that Yellen's comments caused, a shift of schedule earlier by 2 months isn't really that significant in the bigger scheme of things. The largest impact it should have is on short-term speculators. As there isn't any important news today or tomorrow, the surprise hawkish talk by Yellen is expected to play on in the next 2 days. Hence, if stock prices started to show signs of bullishness today or tomorrow, the likelihood of market shrugging off Yellen's comments will be higher and we could see even stronger recovery next week if confidence is back in play.

JAKARTA, March 19 — Emerging-market stocks fell for the first time in three days as Chinese developers extended declines and investors weighed prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus cuts. The yuan weakened beyond 6.20 per dollar for the first time since April.

China Vanke Co. sank 3.7 per cent in Shenzhen and Poly Real Estate Group Co. fell to a one-week low in Shanghai after the collapse of a private developer spurred concern the industry may face defaults. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. dropped to a three-month low in Mumbai after the Mint newspaper said earnings would be weak. Russia’s Micex Index retreated 0.5 per cent. The yuan lost 0.13 per cent versus the dollar.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated 0.2 per cent to 950.64 as of 2.10pm in Hong Kong. Investors are bracing for more losses for real-estate companies as lenders pull back from the industry and local governments rein in home values in the world’s second-largest economy.

The Fed is expected to cut its bond-buying programme at its two-day meeting that ends today, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The situation of Chinese developers is a concern for investors,” Laurentia Amica Darmawan, a money manager at First State Investments, said in Jakarta. “The tightening cycle globally and in China will reduce speculative activities in the industry and may cause some shocks in the short term.”

The developing-nation gauge has lost 5.1 per cent this year and trades at 10 times 12-month projected earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI World Index has advanced 0.3 per cent in 2014 and is valued at 14.7 times.

Chinese developers

China Vanke headed for its steepest drop since February 24. Poly Real Estate slid 2.5 per cent, extending its two-day loss to 5.4 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 per cent, snapping a two-day advance.

Stock traders have doubled bearish bets against some of the biggest Chinese developers amid growing concern that a weaker real-estate market will curb property sales just as borrowing costs surge.

The collapse of Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co. emerged less than two weeks after the first onshore bond default by a Chinese company. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. missed coupon payment on March 7.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong was little changed. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. jumped 8.6 per cent in Hong Kong after full-year net income surged 31 per cent.

Uni-President China Holdings Ltd. tumbled 8.1 per cent in Hong Kong, the biggest drop in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, after profit trailed estimates.

Yuan weakens

The yuan touched 6.2009 earlier, the lowest level since April 9. The spot rate has lost 1 per cent in four days. The People’s Bank of China cut the reference rate 0.02 per cent to 6.1351 against the greenback today, the weakest since December 3.

The Federal Open Market Committee will further scale back its bond-buying programme at the meeting, reducing purchases by US$10 billion (RM32.8 billion) for the third time, according to 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg March 14-17.

The Micex fell for the first time in three days. Russia cemented its claim to Crimea as President Vladimir Putin showed no sign of backing down in the standoff over Ukraine’s breakaway Black Sea region, prompting Western leaders to vow further sanctions this week. Putin signed an accord yesterday setting in motion Crimea’s accession to Russia.

Six out of 10 industry groups in the emerging-market gauge fell today, led by technology stocks. Tata Consultancy, India’s biggest software exporter, dropped 4.2 per cent, poised for the lowest close since December 16.

The Mint newspaper reported today that company executives attributed the weak quarter to a slow start to the year after the holiday season and a “softer” Indian market. — Bloomberg###1459||Why did this happen?

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called “Savings Catcher” on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.’s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for “technological answers to saving them money and time.”

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it’s hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn’t include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn’t apply to general merchandise such as clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately.

Wal-Mart’s MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don’t feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart’s focus group. She said she’s been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she’s never had time to take advantage of price matching.

“They’re doing the work for me,” said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. “The only thing they’re not doing is putting the groceries away.”###1466||The Justice Department is expected to announce a settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. as early as Wednesday that could cost the auto maker more than $1 billion to end a criminal probe into its disclosure of safety issues, people familiar with the matter said.

Reuters

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, +2.09% TM, -0.04% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota’s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn’t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.

That was the happy result for nearly every financial institution that underwent the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress tests, the key results of which were released yesterday. Essentially, the tests are a series of measurements gauging how the selected companies would perform financially under a set of increasingly dire economic circumstances.

If the results are any indication, they'd do just fine. Of the 30 institutions in the Fed's examination room (up from 18 last year), only a single one -- Utah-based regional lender Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) -- would lack the capital to survive the Fed's worst-case economic scenario.

This, of course, provides hope that the more high-profile financials on the market will have scope to raise their dividends and/or share buyback programs. This will be determined when the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (yeah, try saying that ten times fast) is released next Wednesday afternoon by the Fed. This is the second and perhaps more critical part of the tests, as it will include the Fed's approvals (or lack thereof) to the banks' capital distribution plans.

Two lenders busy biting their nails and pacing the room in anticipation are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Investors in the two incumbents are starving for an increase in their quarterly dividends, which have stood at $0.01 per share for both firms for longer than anyone cares to remember. The chances are higher for Bank of America to get the nod for such increases, as it had an excellent year in 2013 and continues to thrive. Citigroup is doing better than it has in some time, but still has some fat to shed before it can return to meaningful growth and profitability.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is in the Bank of America club of 2013 overachievers. Although it's been struggling with a slowdown in the mortgage market of late, it's still very far in the black in terms of bottom line and the market remains quite bullish on its prospects. The company has admitted that it is seeking hikes in both its dividend and its share repurchase program; at this point, it'd be surprising if the Fed said no to either.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), for one, will have a few more coins to hand out in dividends or buybacks (assuming, of course, that it's requested a lift in either and the Fed turns on the green light). The bank finally sold its physical commodities trading unit, nearly a year after announcing it was "pursuing strategic alternatives" for the division. The buyer is Switzerland-based Mercuria Energy Group, and the price is $3.5 billion.

This weekend will be a long one for the banks. CCAR Wednesday can't come fast enough. When it does, though, expect at least a few lenders to pop open the Champagne and get good and drunk; at least a few of them should have something to celebrate.###1468||Empty###1469||Associated Press

The economic confidence index dropped more-than-expected to 46.6 in March from 55.7 in February. The March score was the weakest since August 2013. It was forecast to fall less markedly to 52.

"In this month's survey the Crimea Crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW President Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

Meanwhile, the measure of experts' assessment of the current economic situation improved to 51.3 points, the highest since August 2011, from 50 in February. The assessment strengthened for the fourth month in a row, but stayed below the expected level of 52.

The economic expectations index for the Eurozone declined by 7 points to 61.5 threshold. By contrast, the indicator for the current economic situation gained 3.5 points to minus 36.7 points in March.

Although the current political relationship with Russia might have limited impact on the German , the possible upcoming measures will put the German recovery to a serious test, ING Bank NV Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

The largest Eurozone economy grew 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter and the government expects it to expand 1.8 percent this year.

The European Commission raised the country's growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent and the projection for 2015 was lifted to 2 percent from 1.9 percent.

John Hickenlooper — who opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in his state — said Monday he hasn't seen the economic fallout he feared.

Hickenlooper, whose priority has been luring businesses and entrepreneurs to Denver, Boulder, and other hubs, had worried a view of Colorado's as the stoner state could "distort all the work that we've done" in presenting a pro-business image, he said in an interview.

"We haven't seen it yet," he said of the feared negative economic impact. "That's why we have been so aggressive and rigorous with implementing the regulations."

The referendum legalized the use of marijuana, as well as possession of up to an ounce, for all Colorado residents over 21. Titled "Amendment 64," it went into effect on Dec. 10, 2012, after passing by a 9% margin of the popular vote the previous month, though legal sales of marijuana didn't begin until January of this year.

Hickenlooper, to the fury of the referendum's supporters, opposed it, but has worked with the nascent legal industry to impose a strict regulatory and tax regime — and he said the industry has been as cooperative as he always thought it would be.

"We predicted that this would be an industry that would function like any other industry — that they would be no more or less driven or acquisitive than any other industry and they would be no more or less given to regulation and supporting regulation," Hickenlooper said between bites of breakfast burrito at a long desk in his Capitol office. "They look at their self-interest just like another business, but it's a whole different framework: No one has ever had a self-interest like this, where they have got to protect the right to do in a state what's illegal nationally."

"The industry was a great supporter of our very stiff tax rates; generally they've been supportive of our pretty stiff regulation," he said.

Colorado residents can purchase up to an ounce of marijuana only from specialty licensed retail shops. Currently, only already-existing medical marijuana dispensaries are eligible for a recreational license, though this restriction will lift in October of this year. Retailers must properly label all products with clear information regarding warnings, serving size, and potency, and any marijuana magazines must be treated like pornography by being placed behind the counter. Additionally, those who choose to grow their own plants at home are limited to six plants, with only three flowering at any given time.

Hickenlooper said his main remaining worry is polling suggesting that legalization has persuaded young people that marijuana is perfectly safe, when many neurologists believe it can impair a developing brain.

He also said the benefits of tax revenues from the legal product can be overstated.

"The other governors tease me, they say, 'I wouldn't be so rigorous if I had $130 million in tax revenue projected,'" he said. "But that's a drop in the bucket compared to how the world thinks of your state as a place to build a business."

Hickenlooper, indeed, is running for reelection on a platform of economic growth and pro-business management. His state weathered the economic crisis better than most, and his regular emails to supporters bely much concern that marijuana has derailed its growth.

"While the rest of the country's economy is slowly picking back up, we're thriving here in Colorado," he wrote earlier this month.

Weed also appears unlikely to be a central election issue. Hickenlooper opponent Bob Beauprez recently told ABC News that he'd look for "a way to agree with" Hickenlooper on marijuana regulation.

Hickenlooper said he was "surprised" that Beauprez, a former congressman, had chosen to enter the race. "I would have thought he would have supported a lot of our economic development stuff," he said.

Colorado, though, is the fulcrum of nearly every other divisive issue in the country: Hickenlooper is under assault from the right for his support of gun control, and from the left for backing the natural gas extraction technique known as fracking. Republicans, in particular, see an opportunity in tying Hickenlooper to the Affordable Care Act, which he supports, although Colorado's state-run health insurance exchange has not been as troubled as HealthCare.gov.

"I am concerned that it is going to be a difficult year for Democrats and I am going to be painted with that same brush," he said. And while he pointed to a rare decrease in the rate of growth in health care costs as a sign that the Affordable Care Act's cost-control measures are working, he says he doesn't expect that to help much with the politics. He also said he doesn't anticipate wanting President Obama (or any other out-of-state figure) to campaign for him.

"As a campaign thing, when I walk into a room and say how many people hate the ACA, half of the hands or two-thirds of the hands in the room go up," he said.

Hickenlooper also quietly came out for marriage equality toward the bottom of a press release March 3, a decision he described Monday as a "nuance" and natural evolution from his longtime support for equal civil marriage rights, while leaving churches free to make their own decisions.

"The debate had changed sufficiently that I think people can understand that supporting civil marriage is a way of saying I support every single right for every single person," he said.###1472||The largest phone scam the Internal Revenue Service has ever seen has targeted more than 20,000 taxpayers, the agency's inspector general said Thursday.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

"This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen," George said in a statement. "The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming."

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected. The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the IG's office said.

The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of Social Security numbers, and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.

“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” George said.

You'll get credit for them—good for buying socks, giant liters of soda or cat food—but you won't be getting cash.

3,100 stores across the U.S. will be kicking off the new trade-in program, Walmart announced in a conference call today. Exec Duncan Mac Naughton said that the focus is "is to pay more games and sell them for less." Representatives said that the range of trade-in value changes with game age—just like at Gamestop and other retail outlets— but anticipate that $35 will be most common price point.

In a Q&A session after the announcement, the topic of giving cash back for games came up. Mac Naughton said that "[customers] would get a credit at Walmart which I would argue is just like cash." The program comes on the heels of a smartphone and tablet trade-in program and will be also handled by CExchange, which implements similar programs at Radio Shack.

The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online. Walmart says they want a chunk of the $2 billion pre-owned video game "opportunity" but after-market sales of games is something that tends to rankle the publisher who supply store shelves with new-release titles. When asked in that Q&A session how publishers have reacted to their plans, company reps said "they're excited," followed by a friendly directive for journalists to ask them how the publishers in question felt.

Walmart's a huge retailer with ridiculous reach so—while the EAs and the Microsofts of the world may bristle at the idea of their titles getting resold without getting a cut—it's tough to imagine any kind of real pushback.

###1475||Remember that time you left $20 in an old winter jacket and then spring happened and you put the jacket away and then when you took it back out the next winter and slipped your hand into your pocket you realized you were $20 richer than you thought? Funny story: that just happened to Mt. Gox, the troubled bitcoin exchange now mired in Japanese bankruptcy proceedings.

In a document released yesterday, Mark Karpelès, Mt Gox's 28-year-old CEO, announced that:

Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old ­format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC (199,999.99 BTC).

Of course, Karpelès writes, as soon as Mt. Gox discovered the missing bitcoins it brought the discovery to the attention of the Japanese judge in charge of the bankruptcy. Everything on the up-and-up.

Karpelès goes on to explain that this means that actually, Mt. Gox is missing fewer bitcoins due to the alleged hack that led it into bankruptcy:

MtGox Co., Ltd. had previously reported... that MtGox Co., Ltd. had lost almost all of the approximately 850,000 bitcoins it held... Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.

So, doing the math, there's been an overnight 23.5% reduction in the losses Mt. Gox suffered as a result of its alleged hack. This is nothing short of a Vernal Equinox Miracle. Four or five more little discoveries like this and the whole thing will be in the clear.

And don't worry, continues Karpelès:

(Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation.)

In other words, sit tight, every bitcoin person who may have lost large sums here! Do not pay attention to the men behind the curtain at Reddit, or the lawyers in that class action suit filed in a Chicago federal court, who believe that something fishy went on here.

Definitely don't read this Wired article about Karpelès' management practices inside Mt. Gox itself.

No, just sit tight. An investigation is ongoing. Karpelès has it covered.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America’s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against “wealthy Russians” were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia’s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that’s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the “targeted” faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia’s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn’t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned “wealthy Russians” owned stock in the bank.

Vijay Eswaran Entrepreneur, philanthropist and author###1481||Wall Street leaders including Lloyd Blankfein and James Gorman, who have courted business in Vladimir Putin's Russia, are facing a dilemma as tensions over Ukraine escalate.

Their scheduled attendance at Mr. Putin's annual investor showcase in St. Petersburg in May is in doubt as sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea — and retaliatory moves by Mr. Putin — threaten the ties between Russia's leader and businesses including the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on whether the executives will attend.

(See also: Investors not buying gold bounce despite Ukraine tension)

Wall Street firms that have pursued deals in Russia for years are being forced by the dispute over Ukraine to re-examine their bet on friendlier relations between Putin and the West. President Barack Obama on Thursday added to the list of Russians targeted by financial sanctions and a June Group of Eight meeting in Russia was scrapped. Russia banned entry by U.S. leaders including House Speaker John Boehner.

“If you're a head of a major U.S. financial institution, you say, 'President Obama's not going to the G-8 meeting, should I go to St. Petersburg?'” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration. “If they don't ask themselves that question, they're not doing their job.”

'DANGEROUS RISKS'

On Thursday, President Obama ordered financial sanctions on OAO Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender owned by Putin associates, and on an increasing number of Russian officials, saying the incursion into Ukraine and continuing military movements carry “dangerous risks of escalation” and must be met by unified global opposition. Russia responded by barring entry by nine U.S. officials, including Mr. Boehner.

(Don't forget: Ukraine likely to present buying opportunities, strategists say)

At stake are investments made over years and sometimes decades by global companies in Russia, where economic growth had until recently outstripped the U.S.

Goldman Sachs has made at least $1 billion in investments in Russian companies and won a three-year contract last year to advise the Kremlin on improving the nation's image overseas and to help the country attract more investors. Morgan Stanley plans to sell its oil-sales unit to OAO Rosneft, run by Putin ally Igor Sechin. Citigroup Inc. has a more than 50-branch retail network on the ground.

This year's three-day St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Putin's hometown runs from May 22 to May 24. The March 14 list of participants featured Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen and UBS AG's investment-bank chief Andrea Orcel, as well as the heads of companies such as PepsiCo Inc., ConocoPhillips, Alcoa Inc., Total SA and Glencore Xstrata Plc.

A UBS spokesman and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on their executives' plans for the forum.

COURTING KREMLIN

Mr. Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least April 2007, when he wrote to Mr. Putin seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. The bank's board of directors traveled to Russia in June 2008 for a four-day gathering split between St. Petersburg and Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, a private session with Mr. Putin and a speech by former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin's book “Too Big to Fail” about the 2008 global financial crisis.

Mr. Blankfein, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is also a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning Moscow into a financial center.

Citigroup returned to Russia in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ending a 72-year hiatus. Vikram Pandit, who led Citigroup from 2007 to 2012, was a regular speaker at Mr. Putin's economic forum and also advised Mr. Medvedev on turning Moscow into a financial center.

The bank ranks fourth among foreign retail banks in Russia, with more than 1 million clients. The top three foreign lenders, France's Société Genéralé SA, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Italy's UniCredit SpA, have expanded by making acquisitions.

While financial firms will want to assess the risk of being in the midst of the conflict, they won't face any resistance to doing business in Russia, said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury Department official who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors.

“The tit-for-tat between the U.S., the EU and Russia is much more rhetoric than impact at this point,” he said. That would change if the U.S. targets large, state-owned Russian banks or major energy companies with sanctions, a prospect he said he views as unlikely.

'DAMAGING BLOWS'

What may matter more than sanctions to some Western executives is the reduced profit opportunity in Russia combined with the reputational risk of an alliance with Mr. Putin, said Bernie Sucher, a board member of Aton Capital and the former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia.

“The official sanctions are not as important as the sanctions on the marketplace,” Mr. Sucher said earlier this month. “It's more the damaging blows to the markets and the prospect of the reversal of Russia's decade-long commitment to joining the world.”

HSBC Holdings PLC, Barclays PLC, Morgan Stanley and Banco Santander are among international lenders that have abandoned consumer banking in Russia in recent years in the face of dominant local banks like OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, the two largest Russian lenders.

VTB Capital on March 17 cut its 2014 Russian growth forecast to zero from 1.3% as “domestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions.”

If Russia's economy stagnates, banks would face increasing bad debts and delinquencies, Natalia Berezina, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said: “Foreign banks may reassess their presence in Russia if it's no longer profitable here anymore,” she said.

“At this stage only Putin's very loyal friends will show up at the forum,” said Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at Midlincoln Research in Moscow. “They will put on a show to try to put Ukraine behind them, but the truth is Russia is a much less important part in global emerging markets than it used to be.”

(Bloomberg News)###1482||But as I noted, the initial rounds of sanctions seem to be working.

Just this week, after he was put on the U.S. sanction list, Putin pal Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire Russian oil tycoon, cut and ran by selling his 43 percent share in the oil-trading Gunvor Group. Putin is accused of being an investor in that group and of having access to its funds. Other Putin billionaire cronies hit by the Obama sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the chairman of state-owned Russian Railways, and Yuri Kovalchuk, allegedly Putin's personal banker.

And the favorite bank of these folks, Bank Rossiya, has been sanctioned, too. Foreigners probably won't do business with them. Visa and MasterCard are pulling out of Rossiya. And reports are that Rosneft, the big state-owned oil company, has been delisted on the London stock exchange. If true, that would be a significant development.

Undoubtedly, future Obama sanctions will go after all the big oligarchs. For example, oligarchs who own U.S. basketball teams, Pennsylvania coal mines and steel mills, the Lukoil chain of U.S. gas stations, and various high-priced condominiums in New York. Russian oligarch property in Europe is even greater, including football clubs, large industrial complexes, and airlines. And bank accounts. (Hat tip to Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal.)



Will Britain come on board in a big way? In recent years, Russia has raised $400 billion in stocks and bonds on the London stock exchange. Roughly 70 Russian companies are traded as depository receipts, and numerous IPOs have been sold there. So, if Britain closed its financial markets and its banks to Russia, the blow would be huge. Huge. The question is, will Prime Minister Cameron do it?



Another major source of Russian funding is U.S. mutual funds, with investments worth a reported $325 billion. Big outfits like Pimco, BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and T. Rowe Price have served as the emerging-market investment intermediaries. And if that money were pulled, another gigantic blow would land on Russia's finances and economy. The ruble would completely tank, forcing the Russian central bank to spend big chunks of those $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.



And then there's Western bank lending to Russian business: $51 billion from France, $37 billion from the U.S., and $20 billion to $30 billion each from Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands.



The point of all this is that the deflation of the Russian financial system and economy can be done through strict and severe banking sanctions. But those sanctions have to come from Europe as well as the United States.



(Read more: Putin signs laws completing procedure to absorb Crimea into Russia)

So far this year Russian stocks are off about 13 percent. It's a big drop, but not a collapse. Russia's stock market and oligarchs are undeniably waiting to see just how united the Western opposition is going to be.



Of course, there other muscular ways to penalize and contain Russia. There could be a European ban on Russian energy imports. Or a large-scale (if symbolic) Obama endorsement of U.S. natural-gas exports, including 25 new permits for LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals. Renegotiating Polish and Czech Republic missile-defense systems, a harder-line NATO military campaign, and military assistance to Ukraine all fit in the package. Kicking Russia out of the G8 is another good idea.

But make no mistake about it, deflating Russia financially and economically will require a completely united front by the U.S. and Europe. Essentially, banks and investment funds will have to stop doing business with Russia. No loans to Russian companies. No stock market activities. No investments. No nothing.

That's how difficult this job is going to be.

###1483||Security software maker Symantec fired President and CEO Steve Bennett's employment and named director Michael Brown as his temporary replacement.

It's the second time in less than two years that Symantec has fired its CEO. Bennett became president and CEO in July 2012, when Enrique Salem was fired after three years in charge of the company. The Mountain View, California, company behind Norton Antivirus software did not cite a precise reason for Bennett's ouster Thursday.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman said in a press release.

Symantec Corp. shares fell $1.43, or 6.8 percent, to $19.48 in after-hours trading. The stock is trading near 52-week lows and is down about 15 percent over the past year.

Symantec has been going through a reorganization that includes cutting executive and middle-management jobs, splitting its sales force and focusing on the most promising products.

The company backed its outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends this month.

Brown, who is temporarily taking over as CEO, has been on Symantec's board since July 2005. He is the former chairman and CEO of data backup company Quantum Corp.

Bennett, meanwhile, has resigned from Symantec's board. Steve Bennett had replaced CEO Enrique Salem in 2012, and had then launched a strategic review in a bid to turn around the security software company whose stock has languished for years. He'd announced at the time, "I took this job because I believe that our assets are better than our performance."

Bennett is a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp who was also an executive at General Electric Co.

On Friday, shares of VTB Bank fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with Sberbank the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

“The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,” Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

“As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven’t seen them, we haven’t felt them yet,” Rogozin said.

Investors felt them on Friday.

The J.P. Morgan Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine’s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets.

What U.S. Sanctions On Russia Will Really Do -- Fortune

Western Banks Lend Billions To Russia -- CNN

Sberbank And VTB Decline Because Of Ukraine -- Bloomberg###1488||Washington has seriously upped the ante on Vladimir Putin by slapping sanctions on some of his most powerful allies.

Now on the U.S. blacklist are Kremlin banker Yuri Kovalchuk and his Bank Rossiya, major oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and at the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin’s chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief. Most have deep ties with Putin and have grown rich during his time in power.

The EU has predictably acted more cautiously, adding a further 12 names to the list of Russian and Crimean officials already hit with travel bans and asset freezes, cancelling an EU-Russia summit and starting preparatory work on broader financial and trade sanctions – “stage 3” which Angela Merkel said would be triggered if Putin escalated the crisis any further.

The dozen new names will be published today.

Russia’s retaliatory sanctions so far look thin – banning senior U.S. politicians from travelling there, which was greeted with derision by the likes of John Boehner and John McCain. But there could be more to follow which will hurt Europe, with its deep economic and trade ties with Russia.

The working assumption remains that it would cost Moscow too much to curb or cut off its gas supplies to the EU. It supplies a third of Europe’s gas and more than a fifth of its oil but the EU has hefty reserves after a mild winter.

The other presumption is that while Europe will not go to the wall over Crimea, any Russian intervention in the east of Ukraine would demand a more robust, though not military, response from there and Washington. But no one really knows how Putin will react next.

If any reminder of the cost was needed, Russian stocks have fallen nearly three percent this morning and last night Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on Russia’s credit rating to negative from stable. It expects further sanctions to be imposed.

Bank Rossiya has said it is working as normal today though Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing payment transactions services for its clients.

The EU plans to sign an “association agreement” with Ukraine today, promising closer political and trade ties that will help draw it more closely into Europe and boost its economic growth. This is another way of hurting Russia.

By luring the rump of Ukraine towards the west and priming it with funds, it could be lost to Russia forever, dealing a fatal blow to Putin’s plan for a Eurasian trading bloc. For Kiev’s part, it may have to adopt an ostensibly neutral stance between east and west to avoid provoking Moscow further.

Brussels is giving Ukraine unfettered access to the 28-nation bloc’s 500 million consumers even before a proposed bilateral free-trade accord comes into force later this year. And it has also brought forward plans to finalise agreements with Moldova and Georgia, signing them by June at the latest.

An IMF team in Kiev has extended its work on an aid package until Tuesday, saying good progress had been made.

The U.S. and EU would row in behind an IMF package, helping Ukraine meet its debt obligations and begin the process of rebuilding. A meeting of G7 leaders in the Hague on Monday could be pivotal in that regard.

EU minds have also been focused on reducing their dependence on Russian energy which would eventually leave Moscow nowhere to look but east. Longer-term, that means boosting “indigenous supplies”, which include renewable energy and shale gas, exploring how much U.S. gas could be shipped to Europe and before that looking to the Gulf for LNG.

EU sources said the leaders agreed to accelerate work to upgrade cross-border energy networks to reduce individual member states’ vulnerability to supply cuts, and speed up building new liquefied natural gas import terminals to diversify suppliers.

Elsewhere, Rome is poised to announce a new issue of its popular BTP Italia bond. The retail bond aimed at ordinary Italians set a

European record by raising 22.3 billion euros at the last sale in November. It has also attracted institutional buyers.

S&P has affirmed Greece’s rating at B-, deep in junk territory, with a stable outlook, saying its economy is gradually rebalancing. It said it could raise the rating if growth were to pick up more substantially. The agency is also due to run the rule over Nigeria.###1489||PanARMENIAN.Net - The European Union has reached a deal on a major step toward creating a banking union that is meant to stabilize the financial system and make it easier to deal with troubled banks, the Associated Press reports.

After all night negotiations lasting into Thursday, March 20, EU member states and the parliament broke a deadlock on how to set up a joint authority that can restructure or shut down failing banks.

Corien Wortmann-Kool, a lead negotiator for the parliament, said that "this is very good for restoring confidence in European banks."

She said that under the new rules troubled banks could be dealt with "within a weekend" instead of the protracted process before that often undermined credibility in the EU's financial system.

Negotiators had insisted on reaching a deal before the European elections in May.###1490||Why did this happen?

This Oct. 14, 2013 screen shot provided by Airbnb from their website shows a typical search for listings of rooms to rent, in this case in the Queens borough of New York, through Airbnb. New York City tourists these days are increasingly opting to rent space in a strangers' house through sites like Airbnb to avoid staying in a pricey hotel, but officials say the practice is often illegal, undercuts the hotel industry, avoids taxes and threatens apartment building safety.

Airbnb, a site that allows users to rent out couches, rooms, apartments and homes could be valued as much as $10 billion, a report says.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the startup is in the process of starting a new fundraising round worth $400 million to $500 million.

The company hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability. According to its site, there are more than 600,000 listings worldwide.

At $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than several large hotel companies, even more so than Wyndham Worldwide and Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, says the report.

The Redwood City, Calif.-based IT hardware and software provider posted earnings of 68 cents a share on revenue of $9.32 billion, but Thomson Reuters analysts expected the enterprise software and computer hardware company to report earnings of 70 cents a share on revenue of $9.36 billion. Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago.

The stock price closed at $38.84, but following the report it was down about 3.3 percent at $37.55. In contrast, customer and competitor Salesforce was up 2.25 percent at $59.63 on the day.

Oracle Co-President Mark Hurd told analysts on a conference call that new software sales and Web-based subscription rose 4 percent from the same period a year ago. Revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.

Cloud App Bookings Up 60 Percent

Cloud app bookings, upon which Oracle is pinning much of its future business, saw healthy growth of more than 60 percent, Hurd said.

"Our quarterly cloud application revenue is now approaching $300 million. All of our strategic cloud application suites, including Fusion Enterprise Resource Planning, Fusion Human Capital Management and Fusion Customer Experience, posted triple-digit revenue growth," Hurd said.

Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud apps, thanks largely to "more feet on the street" after a sales reorganization in 2012 and a year of experience for new sales people.

"We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now," Hurd said. "We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer."

Sales of Oracle's hardware systems -- including commodity servers and storage and the new-gen Exadata analytics machines -- grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first uptick since the software company's $7.4 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in January 2010.

What a Couple of Analysts Said

"From my point of view, it was in line with what we expected, which wasn't rapid growth in terms of top line, but low to moderate," Gartner analyst Charles Eschinger told eWEEK. "Within the larger enterprise spaces, it was pretty consistent with what we're seeing: buyers having interest in [new] technology but perhaps holding back a little bit more than what we saw last year.

"Oracle's core products really didn't drive the growth. The real growth came from the new products: Fusion and their acquired products and then some of the [new 12C] database. That is where we're seeing more growth in terms of the industry overall and what we expected to hear and see from Oracle."

Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research wrote in a media advisory that Oracle "is not able to fully participate in the new-IT spend; its products are still considered to be for the existing IT. Large projects on Oracle are getting scaled down, large deals are taking a lot longer (30% to 50% longer) to close and new-IT players -- Amazon.com, Pivotal and VoltDB -- are putting competitive pressure on Oracle."

Still, Chowdhry wrote, "the IT spend environment is improving, and Oracle is one of the prime beneficiaries of this trend. Oracle marketing solutions are gaining traction as Oracle continues to make smart acquisitions. Oracle, along with Salesforce.com and Adobe, continue to benefit from increased spending on the marketing solutions.

"The industry is big enough and is currently not at the stage where one vendor needs to take market share from the other. Oracle, Salesforce.com and Adobe are all equally doing well with their marketing solutions offering."###1496||By Sneha Shankar - Japanese automaker Toyota (NYSE:TM) has signed a $1.2 billion settlement with U.S. investigators to end a criminal probe into its handling of problems with its vehicles that involved a sudden and automatic increase in acceleration, media reports said Wednesday, citing sources.

More than 400 customers had filed a lawsuit against the company for $1.6 billion, stating economic losses and causing Toyota to recall more than 10 million vehicles worldwide between 2009 and 2010. Toyota had settled 131 cases by March 17 and is trying to settle 300 more, Bloomberg reported, citing a status report filed in Santa Ana, Calif. Over the past four years, U.S. investigators have been examining how Toyota dealt with driver complaints about a sudden increase in acceleration in its vehicles and whether the company made incomplete disclosures.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Steve Curtis, a spokesperson for Toyota, said according to Bloomberg. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The Department of Justice also found that Toyota had made misleading statements to the U.S. government and the public about safety problems in its vehicles, which came to light during the company's internal audit.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, said in 2010 that five people had died as a result of accidents due to unwanted acceleration, according to the Wall Street Journal. Toyota has been fined four times by the NHTSA for a total of $66.2 million, for not reporting safety defects to the government, out of which three fines were related to unwanted acceleration.

In February, the company had recalled 2.1 million vehicles worldwide due to a software problem, which led to sudden stops in models such as the Prius, RAV4, Tacoma and Lexus. Since 2009, Toyota recalls have affected more than 14 million vehicles worldwide.

The automaker, which faces investigations by two congressional committees, the NHTSA and a criminal inquiry by a Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, is expected to avoid criminal charges under the terms of the latest settlement.

Toyota’s settlement closely follows a federal government investigation into General Motors, or GM, (NYSE:GM) over the company's handling of decade-long problems involving faulty ignition switches and malfunctioning airbags. The problems have forced Detroit-based GM to recall more than 3 million vehicles in the last two months.###1497||Empty###1498||Empty###1499||Exclusive Free E-Book

Based on the historic three pence piece, it will be introduced in 2017.

Ahead of Wednesday’s Budget, chancellor George Osborne tweeted an image of the £1 coin next to the Budget Box, saying, “Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy – starting with a resilient pound coin.”

The Royal Mint says that the coin’s launch is necessary because the current coin – which has been in circulation for 30 years – is vulnerable to counterfeiting.

The Treasury-owned body estimates that 3% of all existing £1 coins – about 45 million – are forgeries.

“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency,” they said.

The new coin is based on the design of the ‘threepenny bit’, a 12-sided coin that was used from 1937 to 1971. However, the new design will use pioneering technology developed by the Mint to make it easier to authenticate and much harder to duplicate.

It is hoped that the move will save taxpayers millions by cutting fraud, though in the short term the changeover may prove costly.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Royal Mint’s director of circulating coin sales Andrew Hill admitted that it is likely that coin-accepting machines across the country – such as parking meters and vending machines – will have to be adapted.

This process would cost the economy around £20 million over the next three years, he said.

“Our role is very important – for now it is to consult with our stakeholder and a major stakeholder is the automatic vending association.

“We have to make sure that, as well as being a secure coin, we look at the impact to industry and make sure that we do everything we can to make the changeover as smooth as possible.”

The replacement of the £1 coin follows the Bank of England’s announcement that plastic banknotes are to be brought into circulation in the UK by 2016.

The polymer notes are also said to be more difficult to counterfeit, more durable and resistant to water.

Bank of England says plastic banknotes will be in circulation by 2016

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: " After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit".

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: " The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

The board will now conduct a search for a permanent CEO.

Under Steve Bennett, Symantec announced a new strategy called, "Symantec 4.0," intended to streamline the organization, cut costs, and push organic innovation. A good plan, but my guess is that things weren't moving forward as fast as the board wanted, so it decided to make a change. As an outsider, it did seem like Symantec circled the wagons, focused on internal operations, and kept its eyes off the market. Thus, the company now looking for its fourth CEO in the past five years.

So what should the next CEO of Symantec do? I'm pretty sure that Symantec's board won't be calling me to set up an interview, but if I took over as the next CEO of Symantec, I'd push the company to:

1. Become the leading provider of managed and professional security services. Managed security services are growing twice as fast as product sales while the information security skills shortage gets worse each day. This makes this a no-brainer for Symantec - it already has great services and assets here but needs a few course corrections. First, the company has to become easier to do business with and improve the overall customer experience. Second, the company needs to extend its services more aggressively and supplement managed services with more professional services feet-on-the-street. Finally, Symantec managed services is one of the best-kept secrets in the industry. Symantec needs to put some marketing dough behind this effort to gain visibility and brand recognition.

2. Get active in M&A again. I get the desire for organic growth, but I really don't understand why Symantec did a 180 on acquiring companies. Yes, there were questionable moves, like buying PGP and GuardianEdge at the same time, but Symantec also had some winners such as MessageLabs, Mi5, Verisign, and Vontu. Now that the VC bourgeoisie on Sand Hill Rd. is investing heavily in security startups, Symantec should start cherry picking firms, especially those focused on advanced malware (Bit9, Bromium, Cylance, Invincea) big data security analytics (Click Security, Lancope, LogRhythm, etc.), and cloud security (CloudPassage, HyTrust, SkyHigh Networks, etc.). Symantec could also double down on Identity and Access Management by grabbing Courion.

3. Streamline, streamline, streamline. Symantec has been a company with too many products, too many contract types, too many sales teams, etc. In spite of all of this variety and volume, the company's financial success always rides on the back of less than ten products such as backup, endpoint security software, SSL certificates, and email security. Steve Bennett recognized this issue and deserves credit for starting the winnowing process but the next CEO has to put his or her foot on the gas and make the tough decisions. Should Symantec divest Altiris (I would say yes)? Should it back out of the MDM market (ditto)? Should it create separate LOBs for storage and security (tough one but yes again)? Symantec needs to follow a GE-type product matrix strategy by investing in successful and promising product areas and get out of all others.

4. Build a cybersecurity architecture and ecosystem. IBM, McAfee, and Trend Micro are pushing hard to create an integrated cybersecurity architecture for emerging enterprise security requirements. Symantec gets this strategy but is a bit late to the party. To overcome this deficit, Symantec should embrace open standards, invest in enterprise software expertise and services, and become a partner nexus for leading network security vendors like Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet, Juniper, and Palo Alto Networks. To expedite this process, Symantec should become a vocal champion of open source security projects as well as standards from groups like the FIDO Alliance, Mitre, NIST, and TCG.

5. Make Symantec products and services easier to sell and consume. Once again, Steve Bennett was on the right track so the new CEO should follow his lead. Customers don't have the time to negotiate complex contracts or work with a multitude of sales people. Symantec needs to simplify its sales, go-to-market, and contractual processes, and hire top-tier sales people that can work with CIOs and CISOs rather than network administrators. This strategy should also extend to the channel to enable partner success.

6. Establish Symantec as a center-of-excellence for talented employees. While Symantec recruited a number of new executives under Steve Bennett's tenure, it also experienced a serious brain drain of frustrated engineers and managers. For example, Symantec followed a cookie-cutter (and multi-million dollar) plan from Bain, fired a number of senior engineering talent and replaced them with junior people working overseas. This move may have been financially sound but it alienated the engineering community and gave Symantec a bad reputation amongst leading security software engineers. Symantec must emulate Google and establish itself as a center-of-excellence by hiring, supporting, and resourcing the best and brightest who are passionate about making a difference in cybersecurity and data management R&D.

Okay, I may not be qualified to run a multi-billion dollar company, but I've been working with Symantec for over a decade and believe these recommendations could push the company in the right direction. Symantec is a good company with some strong products and dedicated people. Yes, there are hard decisions and difficult times ahead, but I do believe that under the right stewardship, the company could turn around quickly and prosper.###1513||Watch out, GameStop, you have a new competitor in the used game market. Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to “shake up” the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

Wal-Mart’s “true differentiator,” Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can’t compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It’s credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.###1514||With the controversy of the Xbox One’s initial DRM policies, many were worried that the used game market would die off in the near future, especially with digital downloads becoming so prominent and more potential options in the future like PlayStation Now. However, another competitor has jumped into the video game trade-in market.

Walmart has announced their own trade-in program akin to those seen at stores like Gamestop, Best Buy, and Target. Walmart’s program will be more similar to the latter two as you can only receive Walmart gift cards, but can do the trades online. The online trader is already up and running so that you can check some of the prices of the games in your collection if you are interested.

The program is set to start on March 26 in stores, but it might not be a good idea to go in right away as the employees may have no idea what you are talking about. I know I experienced this at Target a year after they started a trade-in program, so be prepared. Walmart also revealed that they will be beginning to sell used games this summer after the trade-in program has been in effect for a little while.###1515||DENVER — Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, extending to medical pot the same restrictions in place for recreational pot.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don't illegally access marijuana.

"Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids," Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the Legislature.

"Everyone came together on this," said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

Dr. George Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency room physician from Children's Hospital Colorado, joined the bill signing and said there's anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said there's not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

"We've only been experiencing this for a couple years," Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.

Asked whether the marijuana industry needs additional curbs — including a possible potency limit or new limits on edible pot — Hickenlooper said it was too soon to advocate for more sweeping changes.

"This is brand-new territory," the governor said.

Some lawmakers have said they want to propose curbs on edible pot, but no such bill has yet been introduced.

Legislators are still mulling pot taxes. The first $40 million from pot excise taxes is devoted to education, but lawmakers will decide how to spend any additional tax revenue.

Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, wants to see a task force of lawmakers and industry activists discuss the best way to spend excess tax revenue. He met with industry representatives Monday.

Among the ideas from industry representatives were more money for researching the health effects of cannabis and trying again to create a state-chartered bank to serve the industry.

-- The Associated Press###1516||Empty###1517||Police officers detain protest leader Alexei Navalny outside Zamoskvoretsky district court in Moscow on Feb. 24, 2014. Photo by Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images

Anti-corruption blogger, opposition candidate, and all-around Kremlin irritant Alexei Navalny is frequently accused by opponents of being a pawn of the U.S. government. After President Obama released a list yesterday of wealthy Russian insiders being sanctioned in the wake of the Crimea annexation, some Russians are joking that Navalny is really the one pulling the strings.

As Andrey Tselikov notes at Global Voices, Navalny wrote a post on his popular LiveJournal page on Wednesday asking readers who they thought should face sanctions over the Ukraine situation.

The leading vote-getters in the poll were a group of “biznesmeni” with close ties to Putin’s inner circle: Gennady Timchenko of the commodity trading firm Gunvor; construction magnates Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who may have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Winter Olympics; and Yuri Kovalchuk of Bank Rossiya, often referred to as the personal banker of Russia’s rulers.* Navalny also brought up these names in a New York Times op-ed the same day, titled, “How to Punish Putin.”

Navalny and his readers got their wish. The very next day, those four individuals, along with Kovalchuk’s company, Bank Rossiya, were the very ones the Treasury Department singled out for sanctions, for “materially assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation.”

Another name discussed in Navalny’s blog post, Russian Railways Chairman and close Putin associate Vladimir Yakunin, is also facing sanctions as a political official. Fifteen senior Russian officials were also sanctioned.

Given that the op-ed and the sanctions list appeared only a few hours apart, it doesn’t seem very likely that that Navalny’s suggestions actually influenced the policy. The coincidence mostly underlines the fact that these were the most obvious targets available. A Treasury spokesperson told Slate by email that Navalny’s suggestions hadn’t played a role in the decision and that the department had “fashioned these sanctions to impose costs on individuals who wield influence in the Russian government and those responsible for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine.”

It’s also worth noting that a few of the other recommendations for targets in Navalny’s Times piece—“the oligarchs Roman A. Abramovich and Alisher B. Usmanov; and Igor I. Sechin and Aleksei B. Miller, the heads of Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively”—were notable by the absence from the final list.

But the overall strategy Navalny recommended in the Times, targeting Putin’s inner circle by “freezing the oligarchs’ financial assets and seizing their property,” is basically the one the White House has settled on.

Navalny, who was released pending appeal last summer amid widespread protests after being sentenced to five years in prison on seemingly trumped-up embezzlement charges, is currently under house arrest after being arrested at a rally in Moscow last month. His blog is also among the sites recently blocked on orders from Russia’s attorney general. All told, he’s probably pretty satisfied today, though.

Symantec shares dropped almost 13% in early trading Friday after the antivirus and computer security company suddenly fired its CEO late Thursday.

CEO Steve Bennett was terminated by the board as "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," according to a statement by Symantec.

Investors were stunned by the move which FBR analyst Daniel Ives described as "jaw dropping" in a note to clients.

The board is setting up a search process to find a permanent replacement. Michael Brown, a board member who joined the company following Symantec's purchase of Veritas, is being installed as temporary CEO and president. Bennett had described it plan to turnaround the company in January 2013. The board of directors, though, was looking for a faster turnaround, Ives says. The company's forecast for the March quarter was below what Wall Street was looking for.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Shares were down $2.60 to $18.30 in afternoon trading.

"While we believe the company was slowly heading in the right direction," Ives says. "Last night's announcement leaves a major black-eye on Symantec."

* Timchenko, also hit by U.S. sanctions, has stake in lender (Adds comments, background)

By Lidia Kelly and Oksana Kobzeva

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged support on Friday to a secretive bank long-associated with the Kremlin that was hit by U.S. sanctions and which serves clients in Russia’s energy sector, including businesses owned by Gazprom.

Bank Rossiya, and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk, were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin’s close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world’s largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, played down his association with the bank, but ordered the central bank to support the lender.

“And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand, it is a medium-sized bank,” he told a meeting of Russia’s Security Council. “I personally don’t have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday.”

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

OBSCURE BUT POWERFUL

Little has been known about Bank Rossiya, which has risen to become the country’s 15th largest bank by assets last year from 54th in just six years.

Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder in the St Petersburg-based bank is a close Putin ally. The friendship between the two dates back to the early 1990s, when Putin served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

Kovalchuk was also one of the three founding members of the Ozero (Lake) luxury dachas complex outside St Petersburg who were targeted by the U.S. sanctions

“Kovalchuk ... Timchenko ... I think I need to stay away from them,” Putin joked on Friday.

The bank’s operations are concentrated around St Petersburg and Moscow, serving chiefly clients in oil, gas and energy. The bank also controls large insurance firms Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom’s businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

“Our companies will continue using the services of the bank,” a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

According to the bank’s most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank’s corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

The bank paid 106.5 roubles ($2.94) per ordinary share in dividends on 2012 earnings for a total payout of 267.1 million roubles ($7.37 million), suggesting that Kovalchuk got $1 million in dividends for his stake.

According to a 2008 article by the business daily Vedomosti, nearly 4 percent of the bank belonged to a distant cousin of Putin, Mikhail Shelomov.

One of the bank’s clients, the state electricity holding firm InterRAO is run by Kovalchuk’s son Boris Kovalchuk.

“We have small rouble deposits and an insignificant loan burden, in both roubles and foreign currency, but settlements for the latter are made in roubles,” Anton Nazarov, a representative of InteRAO told Reuters, without disclosing the amounts.

Three of the bank’s clients, the utility holdings FSK , Moscow United Electric Grid Co. (MOESK) and the grid company Rosseti, told Reuters they hold only rouble accounts at the bank.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following Washington’s sanctions. Western Union the world’s largest money transfer company, has also suspended its services for the bank.

“The bank has a strong liquidity cushion and the imposed sanctions will not affect the company’s operations,” Bank Rossiya said in a statement late on Friday.

“Currently, there is no area (of the bank’s operation) that would require assistance from the Central Bank.”

The Russian central bank said that it stood ready to support the sanctions-hit bank. “If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors,” it said in a statement.###1520||Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise up to $500 million at a $10 billion valuation, which would make it worth slightly more than publicly held Expedia.

The six-year-old San Francisco start-up epitomizes the sharing economy, by allowing people to rent out unused rooms in their home — or entire islands and castles — to anyone looking for a place to crash.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the funding negotiations, detailing that private equity firm TPG is likely to lead the round. If successful, Airbnb will become one of the richest young tech companies around.

Based on the most recent information available, Airbnb operates in 192 countries and has more than 600,000 current listings. Hosts set a nightly rate, and Airbnb collects a percentage of the payment. It does not disclose its revenues.

While being able to raise that kind of loot is impressive, Airbnb will be under the gun to find a lucrative way of investing the cash to create enough value for investors when it exits. One challenge that it faces — which will no doubt be expensive — is the company’s fights with public officials, who are asking whether it is violating local regulations.

These setbacks are common for companies in the sharing economy, with other start-ups, like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar facing increased scrutiny around the globe.

The sheer size of the round makes this deal outstanding, but what’s potentially more startling is how Airbnb will rank among its publicly held peers once the deal is compete (of course, negotiations can always break down and the deal may never materialize).

Check out how a $10 billion valuation compares to some of the leading hotel chains and booking sites’ current market caps:

— Expedia: $9.8 billion.

— HomeAway: $3.9 billion.

— Wyndham Worldwide: $9.3 billion.

— Hyatt Hotels: $8.43 billion.

— Priceline: $68.6 billion.

— Orbitz: $878 million.###1521||###1522||New Robot Changes Shapes to Execute Tasks###1523||Empty###1524||###1525||Empty###1526||(Reuters) – Walmart Stores Inc said it will allow shoppers to trade in used video games for anything from groceries to gadgets across its 3,100 stores starting March 26.

The trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online, Walmart said.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The traded-in games will be refurbished and made available to buyers later this year.

Retailers such as Best Buy Co, Target Corp and GameStop Corp also offer trade-in programs for used video games.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.###1528||(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp's PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam's Club.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

"We know that WMT "invests in price" ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share," Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.

(March 19, 2014 – CNN) — The Justice Department is set to announce as soon as Wednesday a billion-dollar agreement with Toyota to settle a federal probe of the automaker’s handling of customer complaints related to unintended acceleration, people familiar with the deal said.

The investigation led by the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has examined allegations that the Japanese automotive giant initially misled federal authorities after the complaints became a source of controversy in 2009.

Under the settlement, Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges and is expected to pay about $1 billion, those familiar with the agreement said.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” a Toyota spokeswoman said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The Justice Department didn’t comment on the planned announcement.

Toyota recalled millions of cars in 2009-10, after years of doing little beyond changing floor mats in response to complaints to federal auto safety regulators about acceleration problems in popular models.

Regulators were also criticized for their handling of the matter in the years leading up to the massive recalls.

Top company executives came under fire in two congressional hearings during that time in which lawmakers accused Toyota of not doing enough to respond to safety concerns. Stiff safety fines were imposed by the Transportation Department.

Toyota has settled similar allegations in agreements with a group of states, and has also paid settlements to some Toyota car owners.

The Toyota agreement comes with Bharara’s office just starting to look into a safety issue at General Motors. The FBI, which conducted the Toyota probe, is now gathering evidence on the GM complaints.

GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month.###1530||Attention Walmart shoppers: you may now trade-in games at the media department at select store across the United States.

The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1535||Symantec’s (SYMC) board of directors abruptly ousted President and Chief Executive Steve Bennett, whose tenure at the security company’s helm lasted a short but eventful 20 months, replacing him on an interim basis with board member Michael Brown, a former Quantum (QTM) boss.

Bennett, who took previous chief Enrique Salem's job in July 2012, vowed to streamline operations, prune midmanagement’s ranks and reframe the company around a more succinct mobility and security lineup. He apparently took the hit for Symantec’s sliding revenue, sagging share price and sluggish delivery of new products. In addition to handing over his titles, Bennett also resigned his position on the board.

As a side note, Salem now is a member of Symantec rival FireEye’s (FEYE) board of directors. FireEye is among a growing number of younger security vendors challenging Symantec’s conventional approach, aiming instead at intrusion detection and prevention.

Symantec said it has appointed a special committee of the board to collaborate with an executive search firm to find Bennett’s successor.

Board chairman Daniel Schulman said Bennett’s firing did not result from any one event or behavior but stemmed from what he termed “an ongoing deliberative process,” in which he was found lacking on product innovation and growth.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” said Schulman. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5 percent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 percent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.”

Symantec’s revenue fell 4.8 percent to $1.7 billion for the quarter ending Dec. 27. In tandem with announcing Bennett’s departure, Symantec said it expects sales in the current quarter will slide from $1.75 billion a year ago to between $1.62 billion and $1.66 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected between 29 cents and 31 cents, as compared to 27 cents in the year-ago period.

Brown, who joined Symantec's board in 2005 following the Veritas merger, said he will focus on product innovation and growth.

"With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan,” he said.

“The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market,” Brown said. "By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

On Bennett’s watch, Symantec last April rolled out Symantec 4.0, its new customer-focused sales strategy with an increased emphasis on channel partners. Under the revamped sales model, field reps are incented to work with channel partners with more resources invested in business development activities and enablement.

Justin Moore, Axcient chief executive, defended Bennett’s performance at Symantec’s helm.

“When Bennett announced his vision for Symantec 4.0, which was announced less than a year ago, he made the right choices—for the most part,” Moore said in an email. “Yet, Symantec was already too far behind the cloud/SaaS curve to catch up. A change of this magnitude is impossible in less than three to five years.”

Moore said Symantec’s problems extend beyond Bennett’s control. “Like so many other enterprise software companies, it has struggled to transition to the enterprise cloud world proving that it is indeed a systemic issue that goes far beyond Bennett's control.”###1536||Save 70% off your food shopping (but it might be out of date)

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state — Iowa — where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that’s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.

The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That’s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation’s job market than the employer survey did.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state’s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.

North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.

Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn’t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.

The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.

California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.###1538||The Federal Reserve's annual test of big banks' financial health showed the largest US firms are strong enough to withstand a severe economic downturn, potentially clearing the way for banks to reward investors with dividends and stock buybacks.

Russia retaliated for US sanctions today but it's unclear if that was in retaliation for the first round of sanctions or the second round. The individual sanctions are a joke but sanctions against a bank could have some real effects. The loser is Bank Rossiya, which is the fifth-largest in Russia and has assets of about $10 billion (but only 1% of customer deposits). If Russia decides to respond in equal measure, what's the fifth-largest bank in the US? Goldman Sachs. Of course, Goldman's assets are an order of magnitude larger and they actually do business in Russia but I'm sure a few US bank executives in Russia are feeling stressed.###1543||Russians have a new reason to hoist a glass these days: According to a popular Russian post on Twitter, the toast du jour is “To US sanctions!”

It’s not clear whether the imbibing is due to joy or despair, but the latest round of punitive measures against Russia announced by President Barack Obama on Thursday packs a wallop.

The new sanctions add 20 individuals and one bank to the 11 already on a US blacklist. The people face travel bans and asset freezes. The bank will be unable to do business with any US firms or individuals.

The measures target President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, with the threat of more to come. Obama indicated he’s prepared to target key sectors of the Russian economy in retaliation for Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which Putin signed into law Friday.

“Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community,” the US president said.

The new sanctions certainly increase the tension between Moscow and Washington; it’s not yet clear whether they will do anything to move Russia out of Crimea or curb the Kremlin’s expansionist ambitions.

But the market is already reacting: Standard & Poor’s and Fitch credit rating agencies promptly downgraded the outlook for Russian sovereign debt from stable to negative, and Russian stock indexes plummeted in early trading on Friday.

Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported on Friday that Visa and MasterCard have stopped processing transactions for cardholders at certain Russian banks, including Bank Rossiya, the institution named in the US sanctions list.

Watch GlobalPost On Location video: Awaiting Russia’s next move at Ukraine’s eastern border

Moscow responded swiftly, imposing corresponding sanctions on nine US officials, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker of the House John Boehner.

The Russian measure was greeted with humor by some.

“I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off,” McCain said in a statement Thursday. “My Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.”

But Moscow isn’t laughing. Russia’s Foreign Ministry released a strongly worded statement saying that it was prepared to retaliate tit for tat.

“We have warned on numerous occasions that sanctions are a double-edged sword, and would come back like a boomerang to hit the United States,” read a statement released on the Foreign Ministry’s website. “Using this kind of language to speak with us is inappropriate and counterproductive, as those in Washington have had ample opportunity to observe.”

The United States does not do a great deal of trade with Russia — just $11 billion in exports and $27 billion in imports in 2013, which leaves Russia outside America’s top 20 list of trading partners.

Still, the portfolio of US companies with business interest there includes many of the world’s biggest corporations, which are watching the punitive actions closely. Some of them are lobbying for Washington to take a circumspect approach and avoid whacking too hard against what they consider the economic drivers that are modernizing Russia, the Financial Times reported. Until Thursday's sanctions, however, critics had been prodding the Obama administration, saying the US approach wasn't tough enough.

Europe’s economy, meanwhile, is more closely entwined with Russia’s.

Countries such as Germany and Italy are highly dependent on Russian gas, getting more 30 percent of their supply from Moscow. London banks hold vast amounts of Russian assets — up to $400 billion, according to some estimates. France has a more than $1 billion deal to sell warships to the Russian fleet.

That might explain why the EU is proceeding cautiously. At a summit meeting on Thursday, EU leaders said they would add 12 individuals to their original list of 21 Russians to be sanctioned, but as yet have released no names.

Moscow has some arrows in its quiver that are not specifically economic. It’s been cooperating with the US and allies on issues such as negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program and the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons stocks.

On Wednesday a top Russian diplomat threatened that Russia could change its stance on Iran if the standoff over Crimea continued.

Moscow and Washington are colleagues in the six-nation coalition in Vienna, known as P5+1, that’s trying to rein in Iran’s nuclear ambitions. If it so chooses, Russia could easily put roadblocks in the way. It could, for example, engage in an oil-for-goods barter deal with Tehran, undercutting the effects of US sanctions that many credit with getting Tehran to the negotiating table.

More from GlobalPost: As the Kremlin celebrates, Russia's liberals wallow

Speaking to the Interfax news agency, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was prepared to up the ante.

"We wouldn't like to take advantage of these negotiations [between the P5+1 group and Iran] as an element of gambling with a higher ante considering attitudes in some European capitals, Brussels and Washington," he said. "But if we are forced to do so, we will take retaliatory measures as well.”

Russian dissident Alexei Navalny is pressing the Obama administration to get tougher with Moscow. A candidate for Moscow mayor last fall, he garnered more than a quarter of the vote, but he’s currently under house arrest and his blog has been blocked in Russia.

On Wednesday The New York Times published an op-ed piece by Navalny advising the Obama administration on “how to punish Putin.”

Navalny recommends Washington widen its scope to target “the Kremlin mafia who pillage the nation’s wealth.”

He goes on to name nine individuals. Five of those ended up on the Treasury Department’s sanctions list the next day.

The four who didn’t make the list include the heads of Russia’s oil and gas industries, and two oligarchs — businessmen who made quick fortunes in the massive grabathon that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.

While Obama has not ruled out measures against Russia’s energy sector, it would be a significant step to blacklist Igor Sechin, CEO of state oil company Rosneft, and Aleksei Miller, who runs the state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom, as Navalny suggests. The ripple effects could be severe, something that Obama acknowledged in his speech Thursday morning.

If the US was forced to target key sectors of the Russian economy, he said, “these sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy.”

As for the oligarchs: Roman Abramovich is the owner of the UK’s Chelsea Football Club, while Alisher Usmanov is the second largest shareholder in Arsenal, another popular soccer team. Trying to mess with British football hooligans might give even the leader of the free world pause.

Shares of eBay (EBAY) are up 35 cents, or 0.6%, at $57.77, as the company's war of words with activist investor Carl Icahn continues.

This afternoon, Icahn tweeted to followers that he had released a new letter criticizing the company's management, accusing them of withholding critical documents he has requested pertaining to the company's sale of Skype, which he has said demonstrated conflict of interest on the part of the board of directors when the transaction was done:

While the board and its advisors may try to use tricks and technicalities to keep documentary evidence of malfeasance out of the hands of stockholders, I believe that ultimately truth will win out. It may not be in time for this year's annual meeting and it may even take years, but I believe that we will ultimately be successful in forcing eBay to come clean with its stockholders and disclose publicly all documents relating to the Skype affair, only some of the sordid details of which we recently exposed. And when that day comes, I believe that eBay, CEO John Donahoe, director Marc Andreessen and Chairman and founder Pierre Omidyar will be forced to recant their statements that my claims were "false and misleading."

Icahn, you'll recall, has urged eBay to spin out its PayPal payments unit. As the company resisted, Icahn moved on to questioning the judgement of CEO John Donahoe and members of the board, using the Skype transaction as evidence of bad faith and lack of concern for shareholders.

Today's missive follows an article yesterday by re/code's Jason Del Rey in which he quotes a statement from eBay saying Icahn is not legally entitled to documents he has requested.

Update: eBay has responded in an email statement:

[dropcap]R[/dropcap]epublicans in the Colorado legislature looking to rail against Obamacare this election season will relish a statistical advantage.

They’ve asked the state’s division of insurance to deliver a letter every month reporting the number of health-insurance policies canceled in the state due to the Affordable Care Act. So, new figures will come at a regular clip from now until Election Day.

But the division is quick to note that the statistics the Republican lawmakers are seeking tell only one side of the politically charged story of Obamacare in Colorado. What’s more, officials say, there’s no easy remedy to the problem of imbalance because the division doesn’t collect the kind of statistics that would paint a more complete picture of how the law is working.

The letter the Division sent Monday to the Senate — the first of many to come — detailed that 1,755 policies serving Colorado consumers in the individual-plan market had been canceled over roughly the last 30 days. Those cancelled policies come in addition to the 335,486 plans canceled between October and the end of February.

The numbers sound bad – perfect fodder for stump speeches and political attack ads aimed at Democrats who support Obamacare. But there’s a difference between how the figures sound and what they represent. Division of Insurance Spokesman Vince Plymell says canceled policies don’t translate directly as lost insurance coverage.

“We only have the statistics on the cancellations,” he said. “We’re not a research institute. We don’t measure how people proceed when they find out a policy has been canceled — if they go to new carriers or onto the exchange. We don’t know. We don’t have statistics on how many people are insured or uninsured or whether that number is rising or falling.

“What we do know is that people have more options now than they did before and that they can’t be denied insurance, which is really a good thing.”

The division has been grappling with the charged politics of policy cancellation numbers for months. When the office first started publishing the growing numbers of cancellations in the state, staffers for Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Udall complained that the figures were unbalanced by the fact that insurance companies were offering alternative plans for renewal. Republicans seized on those complaints to suggest Udall was trying to intimidate division employees for political reasons. The flap led to several rounds of news stories and ended when insurance division officials wrote letters and testified that what lawmakers were calling intimidation was more accurately described as the kind of spirited exchange on the content and quality of its work that the division welcomed.

“A fact finding review revealed no evidence of any intimidation and the ‘level of coercion by Senator Udall and/or his staff’ was zero,” wrote Barbara Kelley, director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies in response to a letter of inquiry from Republican state Rep. Amy Stephens. “There was a disagreement among staff about how to characterize the data. However, the situation was neither received, nor acted upon as coercive or intimidating.”

Insurance plans being canceled in Colorado and around the country don’t meet basic product standards introduced by the Affordable Care Act. Just as car manufacturers can no longer sell vehicles without seat belts or with gas tanks apt to explode in a collision, insurance companies now must sell policies that, for example, cover preexisting conditions, offer low-cost preventative care and contain no caps on coverage that leave in the lurch consumers who run up repeat high charges because they have the great misfortune, for example, of getting in a car wreck and then suffering cancer and later multiple sclerosis.

Indeed, the cancellation numbers are being interpreted as bad and good, depending on your view of the system and your politics. Republican lawmakers see the cancellations as a sign of unnecessary disruption and government overreach. Consumer-rights groups see them as damning evidence that many companies for years have been making a great deal of money selling deeply flawed and overpriced insurance plans.

Plymell said the transition this year to the new market being shaped by the Affordable Care Act is bumpy, but that the law already is expanding consumer choice and increasing coverage.

“The fact is, people prefer to do nothing. It’s human nature. They want to stick with what they got, and the law says insurance companies can’t just map people over to a new plan that the insurance companies think is best. So, people have to do something. But now they can really shop around and they can not be denied if they have preexisting conditions. A lot of people will find better plans than the ones that were canceled,” he said.

Ben Davis, a spokesman for the state’s “Obamacare” insurance exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, said it will be very hard to know with certainty how many people who received cancellation letters signed onto new plans directly with their original providers or other insurance companies.

“Anyway, that’s not what we do,” he said. “We’re not tracking those numbers.”

Like Plymell at the insurance division, Davis says that statistics about large populations – such as all of Colorado’s health-insurance consumers — take years to compile.

Davis said that what Connect for Health can and does carefully track is how many people have signed up for coverage on the state’s healthcare exchange.

From October 1, 2013, and March 17, 2014, more than 250,000 Coloradans enrolled through Connect for Health.

The deadline for signing up is in ten days – on March 31.

Tax fines for not signing up for health coverage this year will be substantial and they will grow every year. A fine calculator is available here. If you make $30,000 per year, you will have to pay a $199 fine for not buying health insurance this year, $412 next year and $695 in 2016. If you make $70,000 per year, you will have to pay a $599 fine this year, $1,236 next year and $1,593 in 2016.###1550||This Site Is Under Construction and Coming Soon.

A new £1 coin, billed by the Royal Mint as the "most secure coin in the world", is to be introduced in 2017.

The move comes amid concerns about the 30-year old coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

The new coin is based on the design of the old threepenny bit, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

A competition will be held to decide what image to put on the "tails" side of the coin.

'More resilient'

In his Budget statement to the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Royal Mint's Andrew Mills says introducing the £1 coin could cost £20m

He said the £1 coin was one of the oldest coins in circulation and had become "increasingly vulnerable to forgery".

"One in 30 pound coins is counterfeit, and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year," Mr Osborne continued.

"So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, £1 coin. It will take three years.

"Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.

"In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on - the threepenny bit.

"A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy."

'High-speed authentication'

The government said it would hold a detailed consultation on the impact of the change on businesses, which may face costs from having to change vending machines, supermarket trolleys and lockers at gyms and leisure centres.

Some commentators have raised fears the new piece will not work smoothly in vending machines but the Royal Mint said the coin "will be expressly designed to fit existing mechanisms".

It said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

Earlier, the chancellor tweeted this picture of the £1 coin next to the Budget box, captioned: "Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin."

The current £1 coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing-out of the Bank of England £1 note, which was withdrawn five years later.

Of the 1.5 billion estimated to be in circulation, as many as two million counterfeit ones are removed every year.

Image copyright PA Image caption The new coin has been modelled on the old threepenny bit

The proposed new coin will be roughly the same size as the current one and will be based on the threepenny piece that disappeared after decimalisation in the early 1970s.

The new coin will be made in two colours and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be "authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle", the government added.

While the Queen's head will be on the obverse side of the coin, as it is on all legal tender in the UK, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.

'Pioneering'

HISTORY OF THREE PENCE PIECE Image copyright PA The threepenny bit was in circulation between 1937 and 1971

It was the first coin to use a 12-sided shape, and was worth one 80th of a pound

It replaced the older silver threepenny bit, often used as a prize in Christmas puddings

A silver threepence is still manufactured in very small numbers by the Royal Mint for inclusion in sets of Maundy Money.

A Treasury spokesman said the time was right to "retire" the existing £1 coin and using the threepenny bit as inspiration for its replacement was a "fitting tribute" to such an iconic design.

"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," he added.

Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, which is based in Llantrisant, south Wales, said the process could change the way coins were made in the future.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process."

The Bank of England, which earlier this year announced banknotes would be made out of plastic rather than cotton from 2016, said the move would "enhance the security and integrity of the currency".###1553||Airbnb, the online home-rental marketplace, is in talks to raise funding from private equity firms that would value the company at a sturdy $10bn.

Those kind of valuations are par for the course for today's net startups really, but it's still a strong vote of confidence for a company that's facing legal issues over its business model.

Sources told the Wall Street Journal and Reuters that TPG Capital Management was leading the funding round, which could net the firm more than $400m.

Airbnb makes its money by taking a fee on private rentals, either where a homeowner rents out a room in their house to holidaymakers or where there rent out entire apartments, such as holiday apartments they own that are vacant the rest of the year. The trouble comes when tenants start to rent out rooms and flats they're renting, running the risk of falling foul of subletting laws.

Just like fellow so-called "sharing economy" startup Uber, which lets people share rides in cars and hire out vehicles, Airbnb has run into trouble at home in the US. In New York, tenants are prohibited from renting out their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present at the time and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has subpoenaed Airbnb for data on its hosts in the area to figure out if they broke the law.

The company's home town, San Francisco, is also looking into the legality of short-term rentals after tenancy advocates claimed the service was driving up rent prices and stripping the market of supply.

Airbnb argues that their hosts are mostly at home for the rentals so they're not illegal and says that the service helps people to pay their rent and generates revenue for local economies.

Earlier this year, the firm claimed that it was generating £502m in economic activity in the UK and supported 11,629 jobs.

“With Airbnb, more people are earning the extra money they need to pay their bills or pursue their dreams,” chief exec and co-founder Brian Chesky said.

But critics say that people are running illegal, highly profitable businesses by renting and then subletting many empty apartments at once - and avoiding hotel and rental-related taxes in the process. ®

* Short-term safe-haven bids for yen unwound after calm Crimean referendum

* IMM data shows long dollar bets pared

* China’s yuan weakens after trading band widened over weekend

By Anirban Nag and Patrick Graham

LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The euro held within sight of long-term highs against the dollar on Monday, resisting selling after a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

The dollar gained against the yen as European stocks and U.S. futures headed into positive territory, helped by the lack of any dramatic further developments in Ukraine after the Crimea region voted in favour of annexation by Moscow.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

The risk of flare-ups in tension between Russia and Ukraine has underpinned demand for safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc and some of the bets on those currencies left on ahead of the referendum were unwound on Monday.

“The yen has fallen after the Crimean vote but I would say many people are going to remain cautious,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“What we don’t really know about is what is going to happen to eastern Ukraine. So people are going to just watch the newsflow carefully.”

The dollar was up 0.45 percent at 101.78 yen, still within sight of a two-week low of 101.205 yen struck on Friday and compared to a 1-1/2 month high of 103.77 yen hit on March 7.

The euro was down less than 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3889, unchanged from morning levels after February inflation was revised lower. It has traded within about a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi knocked it lower by voicing concerns about its strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn’t weakened substantially,” said Foley.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

FEWER DOLLAR BULLS

The dollar has failed to deliver the strength predicted by many banks earlier this year, with the euro up four cents from late January lows.

Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed that speculators pared bullish bets on the dollar for a fifth straight week through March 11, with net longs falling to their lowest in more than four months.

Overall, though, investors have maintained net long positions on the dollar for 19 consecutive weeks. The last time speculators were short the greenback was in late October 2013.

A record drop in foreign governments’ holdings of U.S. Treasuries led some to speculate that Russia has been reducing its dollar reserves ahead of possible sanctions from the West.

Investors were also considering the implications of Beijing’s announcement on Saturday that it will double the daily trading range for the yuan. The step was viewed as a sign of confidence that the central bank had successfully fought off currency speculation.

“Nothing forced them to widen the band this weekend, so it will be seen as a continuation of long-term policy,” Citi strategist, Steve Englander wrote in a note. “I would see it as slightly risk-on. Small positive for the Australian dollar, small negative for the yen, but again a second-order impact.”

The yuan weakened on Monday.###1556||Empty###1557||Empty###1558||Walmart said it will allow shoppers to trade in used video games for anything from groceries to gadgets across its 3,100 stores from March 26.

Gold has served as a safe haven of choice during the Ukraine crisis.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,356.20 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 1.22%, up from a session low of $1,351.20 and off a high of $1,368.40.

The April contract settled down 0.44% at $1,372.90 on Monday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,328.20 a troy ounce, the low from March 10, and resistance at $1,393.80, the high from Sept. 8.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine," suggesting that Russia's moves in the area would be limited.

The speech came one day after President Putin recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters opting to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

Gold, which trades inversely with the dollar, has been a safe-haven asset class of choice during the crisis, and Putin's calming words enticed investors out of the yellow metal and back into greenback positions a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's March statement on monetary policy.

Elsewhere, mixed U.S. housing data failed to boost gold prices.

The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Core inflation rates, which are stripped of volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.6% on year and 0.1% month-on-month, both figures in line with market forecasts.

The Federal Reserve plays close attention to core inflation rates when deciding on monetary policy.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units, beating market calls for a 1.6% increase.

U.S. housing starts, however, fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

After digesting the data, investors viewed the numbers as strong enough to keep the Fed cutting its monthly bond purchases, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery, making gold an attractive hedge.

Currently, the Fed is purchasing $65 billion Treasury bonds and mortgage debt a month, though many expect the U.S. central bank to trim that figure to $55 billion at a policy meeting on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 2.09% at US$20.830 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were up 0.03% at US$2.953 a pound.###1560||© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

The Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank’s monthly poll of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts. The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

A ZEW economist said the Ukraine crisis had played a “very important part” in the indictor’s decline.

The index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said. A separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0.###1562||WASHINGTON (AP) - More than 20,000 taxpayers have been targeted by fake Internal Revenue Service agents in the largest phone scam the agency has ever seen, the IRS inspector general said Thursday.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for the tax administration.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

"This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen," George said in a statement. "The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming."

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected. The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the IG's office said.

The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of Social Security numbers, and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.###1563||"We had heard the concerns raised in the letter and had reached out to a number of members of Congress prior to this letter to address those concerns," said Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller.

Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.

The company’s revenue has decreased in two consecutive quarters and marked a 4.8% decline to 1.7 billion dollars in the three months through December 27th.

A person with knowledge of the situation reported that Symantec was also troubled about its product strategy. The person commented for the Financial Times: “It is hard when an organisation goes through that much turnover, it loses institutional knowledge and hurts momentum. When you see that amount of turnover it might be an underlying problem with the leadership.”

The company made an official statement, announcing its decision. Symantec explained that it is a part of an “ongoing process” and “terminating” Mr. Bennet as CEO is not based on any event on impropriety. Daniel Schulman, who is the current Chairman of Symantec Corp. said in the statement that one of the main priorities of the company will stay focused on its target of revenue growth.

Part of Mr. Schulman’s statement was cited by Bloomberg: “Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

The company’s board member Michael Brown was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer while Symantec Corp. is looking for a successor to Mr. Bennett. The company explained in its statement that it is working in cooperation with an executive search firm in order to find a permanent replacement.

Mr. Steve Bennett first joined the company as a Chairman and then took the position of Chief Executive Officer in July 2012, replacing Mr. Enrique Salem. Since last July, five senior executives departed, all sharing their beliefs that Mr. Bennett was not an appropriate choice for the CEO position, according to another person familiar with these issues.

One of the analysts working for FBR Capital Merkets & Co. – Daniel Ives, said for Bloomberg: “It’s jaw-dropping. Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”

Mr. Bennett did not respond to e-mail requests to comment the situation.

Symantec Corp. rose by 1.58% on Thursday to close the session at $20.91 a share, marking a one-year change of -14.32%. The company is valued at $14.46 billion According to CNN Money, the 22 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Symantec Corp. have a median target of $26.00, with a high estimate of $33.00 and a low estimate of $18.00. The median estimate represents a +24.37% increase from the last price.###1568||Empty###1569||Russian stocks and government bonds fell today after the US and European Union increased sanctions against Russian politicians and business leaders.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, Walmart customers will be able to trade in their video games and for credit that can be used to purchase anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will be sent off to be refurbished and made available for purchase in "like-new condition at a great low price." Walmart will distinguish between new and used games by labeling traded-in copies "Certified Pre-Owned."

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.

Given the profit associated with the used games business, it's no surprise Walmart is looking to get a piece of the pie. In its fiscal year that ended February 2, 2013, used-game products accounted for $2.4 billion in global sales for GameStop, more than 27 percent of the retailer's total sales. The big draw with used games are, of course, higher profit margins because the retailer gets to keep 100 percent of the trade-in sale. GameStop's used business represented over 44 percent of the retailers gross profit in the fiscal year.

News of Walmart planning to enter the used-games business led to GameStop shares dropping five percent.###1577||Empty###1578||Empty###1579||Empty###1580||Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

There is new satellite data showing floating debris in the southern Indian Ocean.

This new lead comes as the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 enters its third week.

There is still no confirmed trace of the Boeing 777 that has gone missing with over 230 people aboard.

French authorities say radar echoes from a satellite put the debris finding over 14-hundred miles from Perth.

The company tried to calm things down with its press release, which said that the firing was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.” Yet it seems there must be troubles brewing for SYMC stock.

Let’s face it, Steve Bennett was only at the helm for two years and only came up with his turnaround plan in January 2013. The company has also seen other top executives leave during the past couple months, including CFO James Beer and president of products, Francis deSouza.

If anything, the Symantec CEO position has been dicey over the years. Keep in mind that the board pushed out Enrique Salem just two years ago. And he only had the job for about three years.

As for now, the replacement for Steve Bennett will be Michael Brown, a board member and the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, who will hold the Symantec CEO position on an interim basis. SYMC will then begin a search for a permanent leader. However, the process could easily take months to complete. Again, this cannot be good for SYMC stock.

For example, the company faces intense competition. There is an onslaught of cutting-edge startups that are grabbing a bigger share of the security market. They are also taking advantage of the red-hot IPO market, as seen with the hugely successful deal of FireEye (FEYE).

SYMC stock has also suffered from the lack of a clear-cut mobile strategy. For the most part, the category is a rich target for security products. But SYMC’s efforts have been lackluster. Capitalizing on the void are scrappy startups like Lookout, which have raised substantial amounts of venture capital.

Yet the biggest challenge for SYMC stock is the secular decline the traditional PC business. Consider that a large amount of sales come from antivirus software and back-up systems for the desktop. The result is that growth has stalled. During the last nine months of 2013, net revenues fell by about 2%. Yes, that’s a grueling loss as the overall security market continues to show lots of momentum and remains a high priority for enterprises, especially in light of the high-profile breaches at companies like Target (TGT).

In other words, the new Symantec CEO will have a tough job ahead. And given the company’s track record, he or she will not have much time to show results for the turnaround. Unfortunately, this pressure may make things even tougher for SYMC stock as a new leader won’t have much leeway to try new things and focus on the long-term of the business.

In other words, maybe Steve Bennett should hope the Symantec CEO position remains an interim thing.

EUR/SEK touched a two-week low at 8.8191 at 10:38 GMT, after which the pair consolidated at 8.8239, losing 0.22% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 5th low, 8.8130, while resistance was to be encountered at March 17th high, 8.8932.

Economic sentiment in the largest euro area economy, Germany, deteriorated sharply, reaching a 7-month low in March, data by the ZEW Centre for Economic Research showed today.

The ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung), reported that its index of German economic sentiment slid by 9.1 basis points to reach 46.4 this month, the weakest level since August, from a reading of 55.7 in February. At the same time, analysts had expected a smaller drop by 2.7 basis points to 53.0 this month.

In addition, the euro area economic sentiment also registered a decline, coming in at 61.5 in March, down from 68.5 in the previous month and as analysts projected the index will decline to 67.3 this month.

Meanwhile, demand for the Swedish krona was pressured earlier in the day, after it became clear that the board committee of Scania AB, recommended its minority owners to decline a bid by the German Volkswagen AG to buy the rest of Sweden’s truck maker. The board committee of Scania regarded that Volkswagen’s 6.7 billion-euro offer for the rest of the company too low.

Elsewhere, EUR/GBP fell from a session high at 0.8385, recorded at 8:01 GMT, also the pair’s highest point since December 27th, to trade at 0.8366 at 10:03 GMT, dipping 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 0.8342, while resistance was to be met at December 27th high, 0.8393.###1586||�ANKARA, Turkey (AP) � Turkey blocked access to Twitter today after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "rip out the roots" of the social network where links have proliferated to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Turkey in the past blocked access to YouTube, but it is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country and was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government's reputation ahead of local elections this month.

Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings today. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. "I hope this implementation won't last long," he wrote.

Many � although not all � users trying to access the network early today instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation.

Twitter's @policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or "SMS." It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey � a country that is seeking to join the European Union � as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, said his office was obeying court orders. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and said access would be restored when Twitter removes illegal content. "Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet," he said. "We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness."

Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections.

The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.###1587||Empty###1588||So, you thought the messaging mania would go away after Facebook bought What’sApp?

LOL.

There’s still more money – lots of it – flying around Silicon Valley aimed at those who text and send songs to each other. The latest jaw-dropping deal brings a $280 million funding round to Mountain View’s Tango. Tango is a messaging app, getting more sticky by the day as users play games and send photos and songs to each other. It’s got more than 200 million users worldwide to go with all that cash.

The funding round, led by China’s soon-to-IPO Alibaba (talk about a company about to come into some money…), will bring lots of growth to Tango.

Co-Founder Eric Setton, in an interview at company HQ, told NBC Bay Area “we're looking to make progress in terms of staffing...and add here in Mountain View as well as Beijing, China, where we have offices.”

International growth, for a company that has big growth plans.

But is all this money (for texting apps!) a sign of another bubble? Santa Clara University Business professor Robert Hendershott says maybe. Admitting that it’s crazy money flying around the Valley, he admits that this could also be a time for huge growth and innovation in tech, and that takes money. However, he says “when we start seeing Super Bowl commercials for texting apps, we’ll know we’re in a bubble.”

So, stay on the small screens, and we should be OK. As long as those millions and millions of people keep texting and buying.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart stores for store credit but not cash. The credit can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy.



In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21%, and the company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2bn pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart US.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that Wal-Mart works with on its trade-in programme for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game programme.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy offer used video trade in programmes, but the Wal-Mart's new programme is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in programme.

Wal-Mart made a point of saying that credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6%, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19% since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new programme isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian.



In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. Other retailers offer to match the lower prices of rivals – but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

Wendy’s beginning mobile pay option

NEW YORK – Wendy’s is rolling out a program that lets customers pay using their smartphones, following similar plans unveiled by Burger King earlier this week.

The Wendy’s Co., based in Dublin, Ohio, has been testing the mobile payment option over the past year and said the majority of its roughly 5,800 U.S. locations are now ready to accept the payments.

The move reflects a push by fast-food chains to court younger customers by tapping into the attachment they have to their phones.

Burger King Worldwide Inc. said this week it would introduce a mobile payment program at its U.S. restaurants in April.

Shrimp costs putting hurt on Red Lobster

ORLANDO, Fla. – A spike in shrimp costs is causing trouble for Red Lobster.

Parent company Darden has been fighting for some time to win back customers at its Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains as more affordable alternatives such as Chipotle have gained in popularity.

But in recent months, higher shrimp costs have become another factor weighing on Red Lobster. Chief Financial Officer Brad Richmond says the company is facing a $30 million increase in shrimp costs on an annual basis.

The Orlando-based company on Friday reported a lower quarterly profit due to weak sales at its Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains.

Darden has said it will spin off or sell Red Lobster to focus its attention on fixing Olive Garden.

Families sue GM over faulty ignition switch

DETROIT – The families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 Wisconsin car crash are suing General Motors, alleging that the company was negligent in designing its small cars and committed fraud by not disclosing facts about the defects.

Natasha Weigel, who was 18, and Amy Rademaker, who was 15, died after the October 2006 crash involving a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt compact car with a faulty ignition switch. The car’s driver, Megan Phillips, suffered permanent brain damage, according to a statement from the families’ law firm.

GM failed to warn the teens of a dangerous defect and misrepresented the car’s safety, said lawyer Robert Hilliard in a statement. The firm said the lawsuit was filed Friday in Hennepin County, Minn., where the car was purchased.

The crash was among the first blamed on the faulty ignition switches. Last month GM recalled 1.6 million Cobalts and other small cars worldwide to replace the switches. The company has admitted knowing about the problem for at least 11 years before taking the action.###1593||* Malaysia minister says objects are a “credible lead”

* Australian PM says search planes investigating potential debris

* Objects about 2,500 km southwest of Perth

* Norwegian merchant vessel arrives in the search area (Adds search called off for the night)

By Jane Wardell and Siva Govindasamy

SYDNEY/KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Reuters) - Aircraft and ships ploughed through dire weather on Thursday in search of objects floating in remote seas off Australia that Malaysia’s government called a “credible lead” in the trans-continental hunt for a jetliner missing for nearly two weeks.

The large objects, which Australian officials said were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe, are the most promising find in days as searchers scour a vast area for the plane lost with 239 people on board.

A Norwegian merchant ship arrived in the area on Thursday, but officials cautioned it could take days to confirm if the objects were parts of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777. Malaysia’s government said the search would continue elsewhere despite the sighting in the southern Indian Ocean.

The area where the objects were spotted is around 2,500 km (1,500 miles) southwest of Perth, roughly corresponding to the far end of a southern track that investigators calculated the aircraft could have taken after it was diverted.

“Yesterday I said that we wanted to reduce the area of the search. We now have a credible lead,” Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

A search for the plane that began in the tropical waters off Malaysia’s east coast has now switched to the vast, icy southern oceans between Australia, southern Africa and Antarctica.

Two Royal Australia Air Force AP-3C Orions, a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon and a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion were involved in Thursday’s search which was called off late in the evening and will resume on Friday.

There have been many false leads and no confirmed wreckage found from Flight MH370 since it vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

Hishammuddin said the information on the objects received from Australia had been “corroborated to a certain extent” by other satellites, making it more credible than previous leads.

The larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres (79 ft), long and appeared to be floating in water several thousand metres deep, Australian officials said. The second object was about five metres (16 feet) long. Arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water.

“It’s credible enough to divert the research to this area on the basis it provides a promising lead to what might be wreckage from the debris field,” Royal Australian Air Force Air Commodore John McGarry told a news conference in Canberra.

The satellite images, provided by U.S. company DigitalGlobe , were taken on March 16, meaning that the possible debris could by now have drifted far from the original site.

Australian officials said an aircraft had dropped a series of marker buoys in the area, which will provide information about currents to assist in calculating the latest location.

The captain of the first Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane to return from the search area described the weather conditions as “extremely bad” with rough seas and high winds.

A Norwegian car carrier diverted from its journey from Madagascar to Melbourne and had arrived in the search area, the ship’s owner said. A Royal Australian Navy ship equipped to recover any objects was also en route.

China’s icebreaker for Antarctic research, Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, will set off from Perth to search the area, Chinese state news agency Xinhua cited maritime authorities as saying. About two-thirds of the 227 passengers on Flight MH370 were Chinese nationals.

BACKGROUND CHECKS

Investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane’s communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course.

Exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have yielded barely anything that might explain why.

The discovery of the floating objects was revealed by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

“The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,” he told parliament.

The dimensions of the objects given are consistent with at least one of them possibly being the major part of a 777-200ER wing, which is around 27 metres (89 feet) long, though Australian officials cautioned the first images were indistinct.

The relatively large size of the objects would suggest that, if they do come from the missing aircraft, it was largely intact when it went into the water.

If the plane had run out of fuel, it would not necessarily have plummeted but its behaviour would have depended on whether there was someone in control and their intentions, pilots said.

Modern aircraft are designed to use the rush of wind to drive a small emergency turbine that keeps hydraulics and some electrical power running if the engines run out of fuel.

If the debris is from the plane, investigators would face a daunting task to retrieve the “black box” data and voice recorders needed to help understand what caused the disaster.

University of Western Australia Professor of Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi said that, based on currents in the area, if the debris is from the plane it probably would have entered the water around 300-400 km (180-250 miles) to the west.

The search area covered an ocean ridge known as Naturalist Plateau, a large sea shelf about 3,500 metres (9,800 feet) deep, Pattiaratchi said. The plateau is about 250 km (150 miles) wide by 400 km (250 miles) long, and the area around it is close to 5,000 metres (16,400 feet) deep.

“Whichever way you go, it’s deep,” Pattiaratchi said.

Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that, minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the Gulf of Thailand, the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established route towards India.

What happened next is unclear, but faint electronic “pings” picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. That would be consistent with the plane ending up in the southern Indian Ocean.

The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, has focused particular attention on the pilot and co-pilot.

The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane, after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month.

A Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigations into the pilots said three simulator games that 53-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had played were being looked at.

“We are following up on the data logs being erased,” the source said. “These could be logs of the games that were erased to free up memory, so it may not lead us to anything. He played a lot of games, going into hundreds and thousands of hours.” (Additional reporting by Tim Hepher, A.

EUR/USD touched a session low at 1.3890 at 10:00 GMT, after which the pair trimmed some losses to trade at 1.3902 at 14:08 GMT, losing 0.14% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 1.3880, while resistance was to be encountered at March 17th high, 1.3948.

Building permits for future projects rose 7.7% to a 1.018 million annualized pace last month, the most since October, data by the US Department of Commerce showed today. The number of permits filed for future projects in January was upward revised to a 0.945 million pace from a 0.937 million reported earlier. Analysts had expected a smaller gain to a 0.960 million pace in February. The increase reflected a surge in applications for apartment-building construction. However, one-family building permits declined for a third consecutive month, reaching the weakest level in a year.

At the same time, housing starts declined at a 0.2% annualized rate to 0.907 million last month, after a revised up 0.909 million pace in the previous month. Analysts had predicted an increase to 0.910 million housing starts in February.

A separate report revealed that consumer prices in the US rose 0.1% in February, in line with analysts’ projections and matching January’s advance. Data also showed that more than 50% of the increase was due to higher food costs.

The Federal Reserve, which reduced monthly bond buying by $10 billion at the prior two meetings, will cut purchases by another $10 billion to $55 billion, and continue reductions at the same pace at every meeting before exiting the program at its Oct. 28-29 gathering, according to a Bloomberg survey.

The company’s revenue has decreased in two consecutive quarters and marked a 4.8% decline to 1.7 billion dollars in the three months through December 27th.

A person with knowledge of the situation reported that Symantec was also troubled about its product strategy. The person commented for the Financial Times: “It is hard when an organisation goes through that much turnover, it loses institutional knowledge and hurts momentum. When you see that amount of turnover it might be an underlying problem with the leadership.”

The company made an official statement, announcing its decision. Symantec explained that it is a part of an “ongoing process” and “terminating” Mr. Bennet as CEO is not based on any event on impropriety. Daniel Schulman, who is the current Chairman of Symantec Corp. said in the statement that one of the main priorities of the company will stay focused on its target of revenue growth.

Part of Mr. Schulman’s statement was cited by Bloomberg: “Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

The company’s board member Michael Brown was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer while Symantec Corp. is looking for a successor to Mr. Bennett. The company explained in its statement that it is working in cooperation with an executive search firm in order to find a permanent replacement.

Mr. Steve Bennett first joined the company as a Chairman and then took the position of Chief Executive Officer in July 2012, replacing Mr. Enrique Salem. Since last July, five senior executives departed, all sharing their beliefs that Mr. Bennett was not an appropriate choice for the CEO position, according to another person familiar with these issues.

One of the analysts working for FBR Capital Merkets & Co. – Daniel Ives, said for Bloomberg: “It’s jaw-dropping. Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”

Mr. Bennett did not respond to e-mail requests to comment the situation.

Symantec Corp. rose by 1.58% on Thursday to close the session at $20.91 a share, marking a one-year change of -14.32%. The company is valued at $14.46 billion According to CNN Money, the 22 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Symantec Corp. have a median target of $26.00, with a high estimate of $33.00 and a low estimate of $18.00. The median estimate represents a +24.37% increase from the last price.###1598||The UK is planning to introduce a new 12-sided £1 coin that it says will be the hardest in the world to fake. Pending approval, the dodecagonal prism will replace the current cylindrical design, and will feature a number of security measures to prevent counterfeiting. The Royal Mint, a government-owned company responsible for minting all the UK's coins, says the new bi-metallic coin will be the first to integrate iSIS, a technology introduced last year with three layers of security.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The UK's Chancellor shows off one of the new coins on Twitter.

The first coin to embed banknote-like security

Although it's somewhat vague about how the new technology works, the Royal Mint says iSIS embeds "proven" security technology from banknotes into coins. The idea is to enable automated verification of authenticity through "overt, covert, and forensic" markings, so a vending machine, for example, will know if a coin is real by more than its weight, shape, and size.

There hasn't been a 12-sided coin in circulation in the UK since 1971, when the country decimalized its currency and retired the threepenny coin. The UK decided to replace its £1 note with a £1 coin in the eighties, and since then it's had a fairly simple circular design. The current coin is apparently easy to counterfeit —HM Treasury suggests as many as three percent of the £1 coins in currently in circulation are fakes. The new coin isn't expected to enter circulation until 2017.

Correction: This article originally referred to the new coin as a "dodecagon." While the two-dimensional shape on each side of the coin is indeed a dodecagon, the fact remains that coins are three-dimensional objects. As such, the correct way to describe a 14-faced shape is as a tetradecahedron, and this particular tetradecahedron is a dodecagonal prism. The article has been modified to reflect this.

Thanks, Trevor!###1599||Antivirus software manufacturer Symantec has terminated its Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett, the Financial Times reported.

The firing, which was effective immediately, came in the wake of a number of senior managers leaving the firm now facing lessening revenues even as the cyber security market continues to thrive. Board member Michael Brown will be replacing him for the meantime, the report said.

A source told FT that Symantec was worried about product strategy after the entire senior leadership in product development quit the firm, with some joining rival firms. Bennett took the helm in 2012 and in the course of his leadership, senior leaders and some important board members have departed the firm or have been removed. Symantec's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, President in Charge of Product and the President in Charge of Engineering and the Senior Vice-President of Worldwide Sales are not anymore with the company, FT reported.

The source told FT, "It is hard when an organisation goes through that much turnover, it loses institutional knowledge and hurts momentum. When you see that amount of turnover it might be an underlying problem with the leadership."

Symantec said it the removal of Bennett was not caused by any event or misbehavior and that it was just a part of the process the company was going through. Symantec shares had dropped 11% this year while that of its younger competitors have gone up significantly. For example, FireEye went up 54% while Palo Alto Networks went up 37%. After news of Bennett's termination was announced, after-market trading of shares of Symantec were halted, the report said.

Brown assured that Symantec has now put together a leadership team that would hasten their growth. FT quoted him as saying, "The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market."###1600||Top Omnichannel Retailers Total Retail, in conjunction with Radial, a leading omnichannel commerce technology and operations provider, are excited to release the second annual ranking of 100 publicly traded retailers based on their omnichannel capabilities and programs offered, as well as the execution of said programs.

Another 650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

###1602||Former Symantec CEO Steve Bennett significantly impacted the company with internal changes and process improvements, but the company's board of directors thought the pace of change was far too slow to keep up with market conditions, according to an email written by newly appointed interim CEO Michael Brown.

In the internal memo obtained by CRN following the abrupt ouster of Bennett Thursday, Brown said he would take his temporary role to work closely with Symantec's leadership team and help drive the next phase of the company's transformation. Symantec, Mountain View, Calif., remains committed to creating 5 percent organic revenue growth and 30 percent operating margin targets by fiscal year 2017, Brown said. The time frame is a full three to four years since the company fired former CEO Enrique Salem. Symantec closes its fiscal year 2014 at the end of March.

Brown said Bennett led a series of successful initiatives that reorganized the company under his 4.0 strategy, unveiled last year. In a recent interview with CRN, Bennett said skeptics shouldn't count the company out. The transition disrupted 90 percent of the company's sales force, but he said the company was set to unveil future product improvements in the form of tightly integrated offerings later this year.

"However, the board feels we weren't moving fast enough towards our 5 percent organic revenue growth target. Revenue growth is what's critical in building our company value," Brown said in the memo. "This decision is about finding the right leader to grow Symantec -- reflecting the board's view that Symantec has a tremendous market opportunity before us and terrific talent. Our priority going forward is to leverage our assets and talent to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and revenue growth."

The CEO search process typically takes between six and nine months, experts tell CRN. Brown in the memo addressed the ongoing senior management changes that has plagued the company over the past six months. In addition to its CFO, a longtime executive who led the company's product development and services strategy took his leave as well.

"I know that management changes can be distracting and we've had too many of them recently, but let's keep focused on delivering new products and supporting our customers," Brown said. "We have hired some great talent during the past 18 months which, combined with the team we already had in place, gives me confidence that we can accelerate our progress -- especially in building our go-to-market capability and brand, as well as investing in new product offerings."

Symantec has scheduled an "all-hands" meeting Friday and Monday for its Americas and EMEA teams. Meanwhile, Symantec partners say they are taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that Bennett's vision still comes to fruition, despite the latest upheaval. Istian Islam, a partner business manager at Unicom Government, said he met Bennett in during a public sector channel strategy session engagement last week.

"In general the meeting was positive. Some executives sometimes look like they are ready to depart, but he didn’t seem that way; he wasn't disengaged," Islam said. "As partners we've been seeing a lot of organizational changes, but the rest of the details have been in limbo, with no new certifications and training."

Bennett's organizational changes had been generally well received by financial analysts. Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza told CRN Friday that Bennett did a lot of heavy lifting, separating the sales force in a way that splits the company into its storage and core security and IT management products. It's not too far out of the question, according to Breza, for an activist on the company's board to make a move that could split away the company's storage unit. About 50 percent of the company's revenue is generated through its storage business, 25 percent through its Norton consumer endpoint security business and 25 percent through enterprise security sales.

"When it leaked that Symantec was going to buy Veritas [in late 2004], at that time it didn't make a lot of sense to anybody and it hasn't made any sense since," Breza said. "Bennett has been pretty adamant that the company wouldn't break up, but if you were looking to do so, the products are already separated and the sales force is now split more than ever before."

Following is the text of the memo Brown sent to employees:

I’m Mike Brown and want to introduce myself to you. I've been appointed Symantec's interim president & CEO. Yesterday, Steve Bennett was asked to step down as CEO and Board Member of Symantec. I know that many of our team members connected with Steve and this news may come as a surprise, so I've recorded a brief video to explain the board's decision and give you additional details. If you are unable to view the video, the message is also included below.

I will do my very best, with the support of our leadership team, to make this transition as smooth as possible for everyone. We will continue to communicate over the coming days but I encourage you to reach out to your managers and VPs with any questions or concerns you have.

Following is the message from Brown for those employees who could not view the video:

Hi, I'm Mike Brown. I've been a member of Symantec’s board since 2005 and I wanted to introduce myself to you today as I've been appointed Symantec’s interim president and CEO. Steve Bennett has been asked to step down as CEO and from the board of directors. While this announcement may seem sudden, I want to assure you that the decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative board process, and not the result of any event or impropriety.

The board recognizes Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future -- which we want to build on -- and we remain committed to our previously outlined 5% organic revenue growth and 30% operating margin targets in the FY17 timeframe. However, the board feels we weren't moving fast enough towards our 5% organic revenue growth target. Revenue growth is what's critical in building our company value. This decision is about finding the right leader to grow Symantec -- reflecting the board's view that Symantec has a tremendous market opportunity before us and terrific talent. Our priority going forward is to leverage our assets and talent to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and revenue growth.

In the meantime, we're not standing still. I'm looking forward to working closely with Symantec's leadership team to help drive the company's next phase of our transformation while the board searches for a new CEO. I know that management changes can be distracting and we've had too many of them recently, but let's keep focused on delivering new products and supporting our customers. We have hired some great talent during the past 18 months which, combined with the team we already had in place, gives me confidence that we can accelerate our progress -- especially in building our go-to-market capability and brand, as well as investing in new product offerings.

There will be an all-hands meeting tomorrow for the Americas and EMEA and Monday for APJ where you can ask questions you may have about today's announcement. Invitations will go out shortly. I know there’s some great work happening at Symantec and I want to thank you for your continued commitment and all that you do for Symantec.

PUBLISHED MARCH 21, 2014###1603||Sharp rise in worldwide sales volume expected

EBIT margin target: 8 – 10% in Automotive segment

Group profit before tax also forecast to increase sharply

BMW Group can look ahead with confidence to the current financial year. Group profit before tax and sales volume are both expected to rise to new high levels.

“We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles”, stated Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG at the Annual Accounts Press Conference on Wednesday in Munich.

The planned growth in sales volume should also be reflected in group profit before tax (2013: € 7,913 million): “We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions”, continued Reithofer. The pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

Despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies, the Automotive segment will again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10% (2013: 9.4%). Tailwind will also come from the 16 new models and model revisions, which the BMW Group plans to launch in the current year.

Despite challenging conditions on international motorcycle markets, sales of the Motorcycles segment are forecast to be slightly up on the previous year (2013: 115,215 units), not least due to the contribution expected from the new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs (the R nineT, S 1000 R, R 1200 RT, R 1200 GS Adventure and K 1600 GTL Exclusive).

The Financial Services segment is expected to also remain on growth course in 2014. As a consequence of growth-related investments, the return on equity is likely to decrease slightly (2013: 20.2%), but still surpass the BMW Group’s minimum required level of 18%.

The forecasts for the current year are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

BMW Group posts record figures in 2013 for fourth successive year

The BMW Group continued to perform well during the past year within a challenging economic environment worldwide and successfully maintained its position as the world’s leading premium manufacturer. “We have recorded our highest ever sales volume and group profit figures for 2013 and achieved all the targets we set ourselves for the full year”, pointed out Reithofer.

Group revenues for 2013 totalled € 76,058 million (2012: € 76,848 million;

-1.0%) and were thus marginally down on the previous year, with the difference due to exchange rate developments. Group profit before tax (EBT) increased by 1.4% to a new high of € 7,913 million (2012: € 7,803 million) despite increased investment in new technologies, greater competition and higher personnel costs. Group net profit climbed by 4.5% to € 5,340 million (2012: € 5,111 million), also a new record figure for the BMW Group.

Capital expenditure increased year-on-year by 27.6% to € 6,687 million (2012: € 5,240 million), giving a capital expenditure ratio of 8.8%. The main focus in 2013 was on product investments for production start-ups (including the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer) and infrastructure-related investments to enable further growth.

Research and development expenditure rose by 21.3% to € 4,792 million (2012: € 3,952 million), as a result of which the research and development ratio climbed to 6.3% (2012: 5.1%). Important areas of investment were the renewal and expansion of the product range, alternative drive technologies, lightweight construction and connectivity for vehicles.

The BMW Group increased deliveries to customers by 6.4% to 1,963,798 units (2012: 1,845,186 units), with all three brands registering all-time highs.

Record dividend of €2.60 per share of common stock proposed

BMW AG is committed to sharing its success with its shareholders. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2014 that the dividend be increased to a new highest level of € 2.60 (2012: € 2.50) per share of common stock and € 2.62 (2012: € 2.52) per share of preferred stock. Based on these figures, the total distribution will rise to € 1,707 million (2012: € 1,640 million). The dividend rate is unchanged at 32.0% and is within the BMW Group’s target corridor of 30 to 40%.

Automotive segment: EBIT margin at 9.4% in 2013

Automotive segment revenues rose by 0.6% to € 70,629 million (2012: € 70,208). Influenced by the above-mentioned factors – high expenditure for new technologies, product range expansion and market launch costs as well as increased competition – EBIT decreased to € 6,657 million (2012: € 7,599 million; -12.4%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.4% and was thus in the upper half of the targeted corridor of between 8 and 10%. Segment profit before tax amounted to € 6,561 million (2012: € 7,170 million; -8.5%).

The BMW brand retained pole position in the premium segment in 2013, with worldwide sales up by 7.5% to 1,655,138 units (2012: 1,540,085 units). The BMW X1 as well as the BMW 3, 5, and 6 Series all asserted their positions as market leaders in their own segments.

Solid growth was recorded again for the BMW X1, with sales volume up by 9.2% to 161,353 units (2012: 147,776 units). The BMW X3 performed well again and recorded a 5.0% increase to 157,303 units (2012: 149,853 units). Sales of the BMW X5 were only slightly down on the previous year at 107,231 units (2012: 108,544 units; -1.2%) despite the model change (the new BMW X5 has been available since mid-November).

The BMW 3 Series remained a major source of growth in the past year, with sales rising by 23.0% to 500,332 units (2012: 406,752 units). The success story of the BMW 5 Series continued over the twelve-month period, during which 366,992 units were sold (2012: 359,016 units; +2.2%). The BMW 6 Series was also able to make significant progress, with sales up by 19.4% to 27,687 units (2012: 23,193 units).

MINI similarly set a new sales volume record in 2013, with worldwide sales edging up by 1.2% to 305,030 units (2012: 301,526 units). The new generation of the MINI will make its appearance in the showrooms from spring 2014 onwards. The MINI Hatch, at the end of its model life-cycle, still managed to achieve a sales volume of 128,498 units (2012: 131,569 units; -2.3%). Sales of the MINI Countryman were roughly at the previous year’s level, with a total of 101,897 units sold (2012: 102,271 units; -0.4%). In the period from its launch in mid-March to the end of 2013, the MINI Paceman achieved a sales volume of 14,687 units.

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars remained market leader in the ultra-luxury segment in 2013 and, with sales of 3,630 units (2012: 3,575 units; +1.5%), achieved a new sales volume record for the fourth year in succession.

The BMW Group recorded sales volume growth on nearly all continents in the past year. “The BMW Group’s sales strategy is geared towards achieving an evenly balanced distribution of worldwide sales across the three main regions of the world to avoid overdependence on any single market”, commented Reithofer.

At 859,546 units, sales in Europe – the BMW Group’s largest sales region – were almost at their previous year’s level despite challenging business conditions in some countries (-0.7%).

For the first time, the number of vehicles sold by the BMW Group in Asia exceeded the half-million mark. Sales in the region grew by 17.3% to 578,678 units, helped by a 19.7% rise on the Chinese mainland to 391,713 units.

The BMW Group continued to perform well in the Americas region, with deliveries to customers up by 9.0% to 463,822 units, including 376,636 units sold in the USA (+8.1%).

Motorcycles segment also sets new sales volume record

Sales volume, revenues and earnings of the Motorcycles segment rose in 2013. Revenues edged up by 0.9% to € 1,504 million (2012: € 1,490 million). EBIT rose to € 79 million (2012: € 9 million) and profit before tax to € 76 million (2012: € 6 million). Segment earnings in 2012 were impacted by expenses incurred in realigning the Motorcycles business. Despite challenging market conditions, a new sales volume record was set for 2013, with the number of BMW motorcycles delivered to customers reaching a new of level of 115,215 units (2012: 106,358 units; +8.3%).

Good progress made by Financial Services segment

The Financial Services segment continued to perform well during the past year. Revenuesincreased by 1.7% to € 19,874 million (2012: € 19,550 million). Profit before tax amounted to € 1,639 million (2012: € 1,561 million), 5.0% ahead of the previous year.

The number of new contracts within the credit financing and leasing lines of business grew worldwide by 9.7% to 1,471,385 contracts (2012: 1,341,296 contracts). The portfolio of lease and financing contracts in place with dealers and retail customers at 31 December 2013 climbed by 7.4% to a total of 4,130,002 contracts (2012: 3,846,364 contracts).

Workforce size increased – record number of apprentices

In 2013, the BMW Group trained more young people than ever before, employing a total of 4,445apprentices worldwide. Reithofer commented: “We consider training to be an investment in the future of the company and in society.

The size of the workforce increased by 4.2% in 2013, reflecting both dynamic growth in business volumes and the rapid pace of innovation. At the end of the reporting period, the BMW Group had a worldwide workforce of 110,351 employees (31 December 2012: 105,876 employees). The increase is due to the growing need for engineers and skilled workers in order to keep pace with continued strong demand on the one hand and to push ahead with innovations and develop new technologies on the other.

BMW Group in fourth quarter 2013

BMW Group revenues in the last quarter of 2013 totalled € 20,210 million and were thus marginally down on the previous year’s figure (2012: € 20,536 million; -1.6%). EBIT for the three-month period increased by 4.2% to € 1,951 million (2012: € 1,872 million), while profit before tax rose by 7.3% to € 1,889 million (2012: € 1,760 million). Profit after tax improved by 9.5% to € 1,306 million (2012: € 1,193 million). The total number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered to customers in the period from October to December grew by 3.5% to 527,620 units (2012: 509,684 units).

Automotive segment revenues in the fourth quarter were almost unchanged at € 19,325 million (2012: € 19,496 million; -0.9%). EBIT amounted to € 1,770 million (2012: € 2,054 million; -13.8%) and profit before tax to € 1,766 million (2012: € 1,899 million; -7.0%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.2%.

Fourth-quarter Motorcycles segment revenues totalled € 269 million (2012: € 274 million; -1.8%). The segment reports negative EBIT of € 14 million (2012: negative € 73 million) and a pre-tax lossof € 14 million (2014: loss of € 74 million).

Financial Services segment revenues increased by 0.5% in the final quarter of 2013 to € 4,992 million (2012: € 4,968 million). EBIT jumped by 25.5% to € 335 million (2012: € 267 million) andprofit before tax by 19.9% to € 325 million (2012: € 271 million).

Sally Beauty Stores Another Victim of Data Breach, 25,000 Customers Affected

Sally Beauty Supply is a beauty supply store that sells professional beauty products usually only sold to salons, to the public. It is a publicly traded company that has over 4,000 stores in many countries.

The breach was discovered on March 5 and is believed to have only affected 25,000 customer’s debit and credit card information. The company is looking into the breach with a private investigation firm and the U.S. Secret Service to make sure that the right precautions are taken to prevent future breaches and protect those whose information has already been compromised.

Security breaches on consumer information have become all too familiar lately and are making consumers wary of where they shop. Around Christmas time, Target had a large data breach into the information of their customers as well and it seemed like the breaches kept coming through ever since. What consumers once believed to be secure systems to make purchases with, have been proven otherwise in the last few months. Will new systems be put into place for retail stores to become more secure? As less and less people tend to use paper money, it is certain something needs to be done.

Colorado’s Amendment 64 bars legislators from lobbying state officials for two years after they leave office. But there’s nothing that stops former department directors from going to work for the industry they regulated.

Matt Cook and Laura Harris’ jobs were to enforce the rules and regulations of Colorado’s marijuana industry. Now both of them are working for it.

The news about Harris comes in a release from Denver Relief Consulting that states “former cannabis enforcement chief joins firm.”

The release does not state exactly what Harris, the former head of marijuana enforcement, will do but cites her background in regulatory compliance.

Elena Nunez is State Executive Director of Common Cause, a non-partisan organization that works for credible government.

“There are a couple of problems potentially. One, they have specialized knowledge of the agency and its processes and they also have special relationships that can influence their ability to get approval for contracts contributions or other things,” said Nunez.

Matt Cook was spotlighted on the CBS news program “60 Minutes.”

“Matt Cook, a former narcotics officer, wrote the law and served as the state’s first director of enforcement,” they said.

Cook is now a consultant to the marijuana industry with the 60 Minutes interview displayed on his website. His credentials include Senior Director of Enforcement for the Colorado Department of Revenue.

“We need to make sure those folks who are privy to confidential information about the industry or client matters. Maintain that confidentiality and privilege,” said State Rep. and Assistant House Majority Leader Dan Pabon.

Harris and Cook could not be reached for comment. The governor’s office said it found no legal or ethical breach on their part.###1611||Empty###1612||Why did this happen?

“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform,” Twitter’s policy team said in a tweeted statement. “We hope to have full access returned soon.”

The ban came shortly after anonymous users posted audio clips of what could be incriminating evidence of Erdogan and other top Turkish officials engaging in corruption — clips that emerged just days before key local elections in the country. Erdogan apparently used a court order to command Turkey’s telecommunications authority to block Twitter use within the country, though many have found easy ways to circumvent the ban and access the service.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul spoke out against Erdogan’s actions — in a series of tweets, appropriately enough — claiming that suppression of the service should occur only if citizens’ personal freedoms were being violated. The White House also issued a statement on Friday railing against Erdogan’s ban.

“We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association,” the White House said in a statement. “We have conveyed our serious concern to the Turkish government, urge Turkish authorities to respect the freedom of the press by permitting the independent and unfettered operation of media of all kinds, and support the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies.”

Turkish citizens are no strangers to censorship; in the past, government officials have blocked access to YouTube for offensive comments against leadership at the time. This is the first time Twitter — a company that prides itself on providing a free-speech platform for people around the world — has been blocked in the country.

Currently, however, Facebook has not been blocked by the Turkish government. Facebook declined to comment when asked if it had received any takedown requests from Turkey. A senior Turkish official told Reuters that the government had no plans to block Facebook or other social networks.###1616||Empty###1617||British luxury company Mulberry Group has revealed that Bruno Guillon is to step down as CEO with immediate effect.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Guillon, who has been in the role for just two years, joined the business from French luxury brand Hermès where he was managing director of its French division.

While he has been credited with helping Mulberry to increase its international appeal and grow international retail sales, his departure comes after the company earlier this year issued a profit warning on tough UK trading at Christmas and order cancellations in South Korea.

The group's total retail sales were down 3% in the 17 weeks to 25 January, and down 7% for the last eight weeks of that period.

The company was also rocked by departure of its creative director Emma Hill last year amid reports of disagreements over company strategy. Hill was largely responsible for leading the resurgence of Mulberry in recent years.###1618||Empty###1619||This will appear next to all of your comments

The former manages over 7,500 hotels under numerous brands including Ramada and is valued at $9.4 billion. Hyatt has a valuation of $8.4 billion.

$10 billion?

The company, in its sixth year of operation, allows people to rent out their homes, apartments, rooms or even couches with Airbnb responsible for collecting the “rent” determined by the host and taking its fees. Presently, the company has over 600,000 listings worldwide. While the company has always remained mum on revenue and profitability, in December it announced that it had facilitated 10 million guest stays with over half of that number occurring in 2013 alone.

The service has received millions of glowing reports from both renters and guests alike, but when you are responsible of 10 million guest stays there will always be exceptions. Regulators have also focused on Airbnb with concerns and investigations of safety, oversight, and tax collection.

Airbnb: Trouble in rental paradise

Airbnb has recently received quite a bit of bad press with renters finding their homes trashed with used condoms and feces and, on one occasion, having their things thrown out on the street to accommodate a planned sex party.

After complaints from hotel owners, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the company to discern whether or not a number of renters were violating a state statute that prohibits sublets of less than a month when not in the property themselves. Airbnb, rather than turning over the information, is fighting the order in court.

Despite this highly-publicized exception, both Airbnb and Uber are championing the “sharing” economy where users are able to offer a ride, a room, etc. for a fee that they set with the companies taking their cut.

The last round of funding for Airbnb was done in 2012 with a valuation of $2.5 billion. In the two years since, the company has added 160 countries to its rental service, many of which have far less regulations than the United States, and as a result has seen its valuation soar. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital have all invested in Airbnb in past rounds.

In addition to its rental fees, Airbnb is actively pursuing additional revenue streams including its own cleaning service for renters in San Francisco and New York.

“We are actively looking to build specific services,” Mr. Chesky said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in January. “We need to offer more.”###1624||Empty###1625||Ankara: In a tweet, Turkey's president on Friday hit out at the government ban of Twitter, as opposition leaders vowed to mount a legal challenge to the measure that came just days ahead of crucial polls.



The popular micro-blogging site, one of several that has been used to publish allegations of corruption in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inner circle, went dark in Turkey on Thursday, just hours after the embattled leader threatened to "wipe out" the social network.



The move sparked outrage from the opposition and the European Union -- which Ankara has long sought to join – as well as Erdogan's own administration.



Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a frequent user of social media, led the chorus of calls against the move. "A complete ban on social media platforms cannot be approved," he said, adding that it is not "technically possible to totally block access to platforms used all over the world".



Opposition lawmaker Aykan Erdemir said his party would take "legal action" against the ban, warning that the move would put Turkey into a league of undemocratic countries like China.



"This is an unbelievable violation of fundamental rights and freedoms," Erdemir, of the Republican People's Party (CHP), said.



European leaders said the move violated citizen's rights to freedom of speech and could threaten Turkey's bid to enter the 28-nation bloc. Ankara is already the world's top jailer of journalists, according to press freedom lobby group The Committee to Protect Journalists.



"The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards," EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said in a statement.



"Social media has a vital role to play in a modern democracy. As a candidate country, EU expects Turkey to promote the values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law," tweeted Britain's embassy in Turkey.###1626||Kolin Burges, a Mt. Gox customer, protests outside the headquarters of Mt. Gox and its parent company, Tibanne Co., in Tokyo, Feb. 25, 2014. Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins still remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

The Associated Press###1627||###1628||Oracle Corp posted higher third-quarter revenue and profit that failed to satisfy investors looking for signs of a sustained turnaround and its shares fell about 4 percent.

Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle’s previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals.

On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors’ targets.

Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion.

She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts’ consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said.

“They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story,” said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. “Investors need to see more. It continues to be a ‘prove me’ stock in the eyes of investors.”

The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended February 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit.

Software business still weak

Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company’s $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company’s core software business, said Ives.

Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

In response, four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc.

“They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example,” said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. “They’re playing catch up, but they’re working quickly and they’re starting to make some progress.”

On Tuesday’s call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle’s total revenue.

On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company’s salesforce last year.

“We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now,” Hurd said. “We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and … they’ve been in place longer.”

Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.

Most of Oracle’s business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.

Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.

For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.

Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.

Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Health insurance premiums have risen more after Obamacare than the average premium increases over the eight years before it became law, according to the private health exchange eHealthInsurance.

The individual market for health insurance has seen premiums rise by 39 percent since February 2013, eHealth reports. Without a subsidy, the average individual premium is now $274 a month. Families have been hit even harder with an average increase of 56 percent over the same period — average premiums are now $663 per family, over $426 last year.

Between 2005 and 2013, average premiums for individual plans increased 37 percent and average family premiums were upped 31 percent. So they have risen faster under Obamacare than in the previous eight years.

An important caveat is that eHealth’s prices don’t include subsidies, so the prices for anyone earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level will be lower. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has repeatedly claimed patients will pay as little as $18 per month, without noting the taxpayer cost.

Premiums are being hiked across the board for several reasons, but the biggest contributor is the Obama administration’s highly touted “essential health benefits,” services that insurers on and off exchanges must provide.

Some benefits, such as emergency and laboratory services, are uncontroversial. But others, like maternity, newborn and pediatric services, are causing headaches for huge swaths of the population that don’t need them. Anyone past childbearing age, single men, the infertile, even nuns — their premiums are rising as well, because their plans must, by law, provide more services.

But premiums aren’t the only key to health care costs — deductibles and out-of-pocket costs like co-pays are also rising. When it comes to employer health plans alone, four out of five U.S. companies have increased deductibles or are considering doing so.

Prices may be people away from purchasing health insurance. The latest survey from consulting firm McKinsey found that half of those who haven’t purchased health insurance yet this year cited their inability to pay the premium.

The catch? These bitcoins were presumed to be lost. The find that could provide some relief to the scandal hit exchange.

Time reported the bitcoins were found in an old-format wallet, previously thought to be empty. The two hundred thousand bitcoins that were found on March 7 may help the exchange weather the crisis caused after it had "lost" 850,000 bitcoins. Following the loss, the exchange filed bankruptcy.

According to a letter dated March 20, posted on Mt Gox's website, the company decided to scan all old wallets.

"Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7 MtGox Co confirmed that an old­ format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC," it said.

"For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC were moved from online wallets between March 14 and 15 to offline wallets," the letter further stated.

The company said in the letter the total number of bitcoins originally presumed to be lost have now come down by 200,000. The exact number of coins that disappeared, though, is under investigation and the figures may change.

Financial Times pointed out Mt Gox was seeking a debt restructuring of $64 million.

Reuters said that several creditors were skeptical about the Mt Gox's explanations of how the bitcoins had vanished. It also expressed reservations over the find from a plaintiff who filed a class action against the exchange agency. The judge in Chicago overseeing the matter allowed for tracking of bitcoin exchange.

----------------------

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates SYMANTEC CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.

SYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).

The gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.

SYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.8%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.

In a brief statement, the maker of Bayswater and Alexa handbags said Frenchman Guillon had decided to step down immediately. He had been CEO for just over two years, having joined from Birkin handbag maker Hermes <hrms.pa>.

The statement gave no reason for his departure and did not say if he would receive any payoff. "The board agreed that it was now time to part company," a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Godfrey Davis, 64, currently non-executive chairman after holding such roles as finance chief and CEO in his 27 years with the group, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon "has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

"I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved," he said.

Mulberry shares rose 1.3 percent to 644.5 pence at 0841 GMT.

Under Guillon, Mulberry had hiked prices to take its brand more upmarket from a traditional position of "affordable luxury" and embarked on a drive to increase the company's profile overseas, targeting affluent Asian shoppers with new stores in key tourist spots.

But the group was forced to downgrade its profit forecasts at the end of January for the third time in around 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas hit sales in its British market, which makes up around 65 percent of group revenue.

GROWTH STRATEGY

The warning wiped over 25 percent off its shares at the time, a loss from which they are yet to recover as investors and analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry's growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to suffer from its more upmarket and exclusive aspirations, with evidence growing that even larger rivals like Kering <prtp.pa>and LVMH <lvmh.pa>, Gucci and Louis Vuitton's respective parents, are losing out to newer, more affordable brands.

Since his arrival, Guillon, who has also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry's share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged the stock down to be worth less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned for the final time.

On that occasion the 48 year old, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, had told Reuters his strategy would not change.

Adding to his woes, the group also lost Emma Hill, the creative director behind its hit Alexa and Del Rey bags, last September, and have yet to appoint a replacement. ($1 = 0.6014 British Pounds)

(Editing by David Holmes)###1647||Symantec has fired CEO Steve Bennett, who was in the second year of a complete overhaul of the company's product and go-to-market strategy. Some of Symantec's top partners tell CRN that the move comes as a complete shock and signals continued turmoil at the company.

The Symantec board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. The company said a special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. Symantec stock was halted temporarily following the announcement late Thursday. It dropped as much as 10 percent in after-hours trading.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said Daniel Schulman, chairman of Symantec's board of directors, in a statement. "Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum.

Bennett was appointed CEO in July 2012, replacing Enrique Salem, who served in the position for three years but oversaw mediocre financial results. Bennett unveiled Symantec 4.0 in January 2013, which prompted a year of internal transition, including the layoff of hundreds of employees. He focused on overhauling the go-to-market strategy, impacting roughly 90 percent of the sales force. He told CRN last month that the company was preparing to unveil a product road map that included integrated parts of the security portfolio, but admitted that 2014 would be another year of transition. Symantec's third-quarter revenue, released in January, fell to $1.71 billion from $1.79 billion, a year earlier.

A Symantec Platinum-level partner, speaking on condition of anonymity, had been enthusiastic about the changes instituted by Bennett. The company was transitioning to rely more heavily on a select group of 100 or so U.S. partners, including the partner's firm.

"I admit this has me completely shocked. We have been getting so much about the need to buy into the 4.0 strategy," the partner told CRN. "The fact that there has been so much turnover and transition in such a short period of time will raise some question marks in the minds of our customers."

NEXT: Partners Express Dismay

Bennett's vision focused on creating a more integrated product portfolio but lacked specifics, said David Sockol, president and CEO of San Carlos, Calif.-based Emagined Security. Bennett focused on the transition rather than showing exactly where the company was truly going, Sockol said.

"They focused on how cool it was that the company was changing rather than what they were changing to," Sockol said. "Even the employees were having trouble with the vision; it all focused with the fact that it was changing."

Partners were growing increasingly frustrated that they haven't seen new products or more details about better integrated products, said Alex Moss, managing partner at Chicago-based consultancy Conventus, a Symantec partner. Products being introduced have long been on the road map and already anticipated, Moss said.

"Bennett moves very slowly, and that affected the partners as well as the customers," Moss said. "I think everybody was getting tired of waiting."

Jacob Tukuru, president of Tukuru Technologies, a Symantec partner based in New York, said there were some improvements, including internal streamlining, that made it easier for partners to do business with the company.

"It's a little surprising. I know from our perspective as a partner, things have improved over the last year," Tukuru said. "They made it easier to do business with them as a partner, and we use their cloud products, which are great. Before, it was very difficult to work with Symantec. They made it hard to get information about simple things like software licenses, and it was really hard to find the right technical support."

"This comes totally out of the blue. I'm shocked," said Michael Goldstein, president and CEO of LAN Infotech, a Symantec partner based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "From a partner perspective it's discouraging. We have just been hearing Symantec trumpet its turnaround plan, new products and how bright the future looked. Now, just as it feels like we are nearing the top of the Symantec mountain, Bennett is terminated? Now it feels like we are back to square one."

Goldstein said he was unaware of what led to Bennett's departure or what interim CEO Michael Brown might be able to do to lead the company. Brown's storage background, Goldstein said, is encouraging however. "The only silver lining is Brown might bring Symantec's storage products up to date. Symantec's Backup Exec is way behind the times. It doesn't even support Microsoft Server 2012," Goldstein said.

PUBLISHED MARCH 20, 2014###1648||Empty###1649||WASHINGTON — All but one of the nation’s 30 largest banks are better able to withstand a severe U.S. recession and global downturn than at any time since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

The only bank to fail the Fed’s annual “stress test” was Zions Bancorp, parent of Vectra Bank Colorado. Vectra Bank is the state’s seventh-largest bank, with deposits of $2.15 billion and an active small-business lender.

Zions, based in Salt Lake City, lacked the minimum level of capital the Fed deemed necessary to withstand a crisis after it booked hefty charges last year related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items. The bank’s director of investor relations was unable to comment before publication.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during a severe recession.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests.

The 30 tested banks included some of Colorado’s largest: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

The mixed results did not stop Gov. Rick Scott from touting the latest numbers as he focused on the steady recovery of the state's economy.

"It is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," Scott said in a statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow."

Scott has made the rebound in the state's economy a centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. He has noted in campaign speeches that the unemployment rate increased under former Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist, who is now a Democrat and challenging Scott, has said Florida suffered because of the economic downturn that affected most of the nation and world.

The state's unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, which was lower than it was at the end of the year. The rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.

Despite the overall rate dropping slightly by 0.2 percent, the overall number of jobs in the state dropped by 2,600. The number of jobs is calculated using a separate survey.

Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, noted the decline to jobs to blast Scott for "desperately attempting to take credit for a recovery that's more anemic than what the economy was already predicted to do on its own."

Florida overall has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida trailed Texas and California.

Scott has said the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies, including his push to cut back on regulation and lower taxes.

But economists who work for the Florida Legislature have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or delayed their job search.

Monroe County in the southern end of the state had the state's lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, followed by Walton County in the Panhandle at 4.2 percent. Hendry County, in the southern interior, had the highest unemployment rate at 9.8 percent, followed by Flagler County at 9.3 percent.###1651||Empty###1652||Media firm Today's Zaman from Istanbul reported that Twitter has been banned in Turkey.

By Neil Maidment and Kate Holton

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Bruno Guillon has quit as chief executive of British luxury brand Mulberry, bringing an end to a two-year tenure marked by three profit warnings during an attempt to move upmarket that has failed to pay off.

Under Guillon, Mulberry hiked prices in an effort to become more exclusive and win back customers who were upgrading to pricier brands. But, like others in the market, it has been taken by surprise by the arrival of aspirational brands at the lower end of the luxury range, such as Michael Kors.

At the end of January, it was forced to cut profit forecasts for the third time in 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain which contributes 65 percent of sales.

“The board agreed that it was now time to part company,” a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Mulberry, which makes Bayswater and Alexa handbags that sell for up to 4,500 pounds, said Frenchman Guillon would leave immediately, without saying if he would receive any payoff.

The warning wiped over 25 percent off Mulberry’s shares in January, a loss from which they are yet to recover. Analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry’s growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

The firm’s efforts to become a global brand were also dealt a heavy blow last September when the highly-rated Emma Hill, creative director behind the Alexa and Del Rey bags, quit. Media reports suggested that Hill did not agree with the group’s strategy and she is still to be replaced.

“Given all the profit warnings at Mulberry, it was debatable how long the core shareholders would keep faith with the embattled CEO and his strategy,” analyst Nick Bubb said.

Mulberry said chairman Godfrey Davis, 64, would become executive chairman until a successor was found. During his 27 years at the group Davis has been finance chief and CEO.

Shares in the firm, which is 56 percent owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, rose 1.3 percent to 644.5p at 1028 GMT.

GROWTH STRATEGY

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to pursue more exclusive aspirations, larger rivals like Kering and LVMH, respective parents to Gucci and Louis Vuitton, have also been surprised by newcomers grabbing customers at the lower end of the market.

The likes of Michael Kors and Tory Burch, whose bags are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals, are proving increasingly popular, especially with emerging market customers - the industry’s main growth engine.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Birkin handbag maker Hermes and also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry’s share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged that value down to less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned on profits again.

On the last occasion Guillon, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, told Reuters he’d stick to his strategy. A new collection of bags was unveiled in February in collaboration with British model Cara Delevingne.

Mulberry, which still sells 60 percent of its bags for under 1,000 pounds, has focused on improving product quality and has committed to making half of its handbags in England as it seeks a higher-end position for the brand.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon “has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering” and increased the firm’s international appeal and sales overseas.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” Davis said.###1654||Empty###1655||Walmart

Walmart is planning to make a splash in the used-games business, the company announced on Tuesday.

Starting March 26, consumers can walk into more than 3,100 Walmart stores across the US and trade in games from the latest consoles, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Wii U. Customers will receive eGift cards for the value of their trade-in which can be used to purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. Walmart said customers will be able to purchase "Certified Pre-Owned" games in stores and online starting this summer.

The company joins GameStop and Best Buy, among others, offering trade-ins for video games.

Video game trade-in programs are extremely controversial. As Walmart points out, the US market for used games has hit $2 billion annually. However, game developers and publishers have railed against its growth, saying that it's effectively taking cash from their pockets.

When used games are sold back to retailers, game companies don't get a cut of the action. When they're sold at a profit, they're also left out. The games industry has lobbied for changes to that practice, but so far, those efforts have not proven fruitful.###1656||Wal-Mart's success in the used video-game market remains to be seen, but its entry is significant.

"For all the concern there's been about the used video-game model as digital and online video games take share, Wal-Mart getting in validates the business model," said Oppenheimer retail analyst Brian Nagel.



"We aren't participating in the $2 billion used gaming opportunity at all right now," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters that announced the news.



According to NPD, video-game sales fell 17 percent during the most recent holiday season.

However, despite the decline, Wal-Mart said it still expects there was an inflection point in gaming with the new hardware that came out last fall, Mac Naughton said.

No doubt, Wal-Mart likely hopes the program will generate foot traffic, or help it capture a larger share of new-release game sales as those trade-in dollars are turned into sales.



But some observers said the bigger question may be the program's possible impact on competitors like GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, eBay and others that currently offer trade-in programs.

That's because the business can be lucrative. While the industry saw video-game sales fall over the holiday season, GameStop reported a 7 percent increase in used game sales for the period.

If the new video game trade-in program follows the example of Wal-Mart's current electronic trade-in programs, the value of the video game will be as competitive as the market allows.

###1657||BENTONVILLE, Arkansas -- Video game fans who are growing tired of their current collections will soon have another option for getting rid of them…and picking up some new titles from other gamers with the same idea.





Wal-Mart will soon be joining the likes of GameStop, Best Buy, Target and other retailers in dealing with used video games, the retail giant announced Tuesday. Starting on March 26, customers may trade in their old games for in-store and online credit at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club.

The traded games will be refurbished then sold as “Certified Pre-Owned” games at discounted prices in Wal-Mart’s approximately 3,100 U.S. stores later this year.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”



###1658||The largest phone scam the Internal Revenue Service has ever seen has targeted more than 20,000 taxpayers, the agency's inspector general said Thursday.

Thousands of victims have lost a total of more than $1 million.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, George said. And they don't demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in August. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.

Tax scams often escalate during filing season, George said. People have been targeted in nearly every state.

"This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen," George said in a statement. "The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming."

The script is similar in many calls, leading investigators to believe they are connected. The inspector general's office is working with major phone carriers to try to track the origins of the calls, the IG's office said.

The scam has been effective in part because the fake agents mask their caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS, George said. In some cases, fake agents know the last four digits of Social Security numbers, and follow up with official-looking emails.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.

“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” George said.

Results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks’ financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year’s tests.

“The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago,” said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment – now at 6.7 percent – would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests – even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks’ progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.###1662||Empty###1663||Empty###1664||Unemployment rates fell in 43 US states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department says the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell.

NEW YORK

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature that’s called “Savings Catcher” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths such as Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart’s online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn’t revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit-card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it’s successful, others may follow.

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then log onto the Savings Catcher page on www.walmart.com/ and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn’t include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn’t apply to general merchandise such as clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and items such as detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card, and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift-card receipt.###1667||Why did this happen?

17.30 (CLOSE): Blue-chip shares have fallen after US Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen warned that US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.

The guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting 10 billion US dollars (£6billion) from monthly bond purchases.

It saw the FTSE 100 Index - whose constituents are heavily exposed to the American economy - fall by 30.7 points to 6542.4.

Warning: Markets have been affected by news from America that interest rates could rise next year.

The slide followed declines last night on Wall Street but in the latest session New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average was up as it recovered some of the losses.

Stock exchanges in Europe looked untroubled, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ahead.

On currency markets, the pound held firm at 1.65 US dollars and 1.20 euros.

In London, the fall-out from the Budget was also much in evidence, particularly among gambling stocks after the Chancellor increased the tax on fixed odds betting terminals from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.

William Hill initially estimated a hit of £16million over a year but increased this figure to £22million after clarification that the hike would also apply to revenues from lower-stake terminals such as fruit machines.

Shares fell 7 per cent in the wake of the Budget announcement and were off as much as 3 per cent in the latest session, wiping up £300million from its value since Tuesday night. It pared back some of the losses later to close down 4.9p, or 1 per cent, at 346.6p.

Ladbrokes, which had also dropped sharply in the wake of the Chancellor's speech, fell by a further 6.3p, or 4 per cent, to 134.1p.

The pensions industry has also been battered after the Chancellor gave retirees the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.

Friends Life owner Resolution was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, off by 5 per cent, or 16.9p, to 318.1p as it warned of the impact on new business flows in the individual annuity market.

However it insisted annuities will continue to be an important product and that overall the proposals were positive for the retirement savings market.

Legal & General steadied after an 8 per cent post-Budget fall as Shore Capital said that companies such as it and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long term as more people save.

L&G rose 1.9p to 213.1p, Aviva added 3.3p to 493.7p, Standard Life climbed 8.7p to 362.7p and the Pru gained 9.5p to 1349p.

But Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues - and lost more than half its value on Wednesday - fell heavily again, down another 13 per cent or 19p to 124p.

The biggest FTSE 100 risers were SSE, up 48p to 1486p, Standard Life up 8.7p to 362.7p, Next up 150p to 6730p and Tullow Oil up 13.5p to 780p.



The biggest FTSE 100 fallers were Resolution, down 16.9p to 318.1p, Hammerson down 20.5p to 545p, Hargreaves Lansdown down 49p to 1455p and British Land down 16p to 659.5p.



15.00: The Footsie cut its losses in midafternoon trade as US stocks put in an early rally folllowing some upbeat economic data, although the mood in global markets remained cautious after 2015 rate rise signals from Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen yesterday.



With an hour and a half of trading to go, the FTSE 100 index was down 45.4 points at 6,527.7, albeit bouncing off a session low of 6,492.6 following the positive US data.

In early deals on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 49.8 points at 16,272.0, bouncing from an opening loss and recovering some of yesterday’s triple-digit drop after being spooked by Yellen’s comments.

US rally: An early recovery by US stocks helped the Footsie cut its losses in afternoon trade

The Federal Reserve head said that the US central bank would probably end its massive bond-buying programme this autumn, and could start raising interest rates around six months later.

Lee Mumford, financial sales trader at Spreadex said: ‘Equities remained sluggish this morning as investors digested Janet Yellen’s comments last night, signalling interest rates could rise by the middle of next year.



‘The turnaround comes after Philly Fed Manufacturing data showed a jump in general business conditions, coming in at 9, far higher than the 4.2 expected,’ he added.

Other US data released earlier, however, was more mixed, illustrating the difficult choices the Fed will have to make on monetary policy.

Initial US jobless claims climbed by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 320,000 in the period of March 9 to March 15, the Labor Department said, less than the 325,000 estimate of economists.



While the Conference Board's leading economic index rose 0.5 percent in February, after a 0.1 per cent rise in January and a 0.1 per cent decline in December.

But sales of US existing homes declined 0.4 per cent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6million, the slowest pace since July 2012, the National Association of Realtors said.

13.00: A big drop by drugs group GlaxoSmithKline weighed on the Footsie at lunchtime as global stock markets took a tumble after new US Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen yesterday hinted interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

The FTSE 100 index was down 68.1 points at 6,505.1, back close to its lowest level since early February.

A 2 per cent fall by GlaxoSmithKline, down 35.0p to 1,620.0p took the most points off the FTSE 100, after the firm disclosed that one of its experimental cancer vaccine failed in a second test.

The findings showed that Glaxo's MAGE-A3 therapeutic vaccine did not help patients with non-small cell lung cancer in a late-stage Phase III study.

’With a further read-out pending, we are not pinning much hope on the product,’ said Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou.

Global stocks were hit after Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen said that the US central bank would probably end its massive bond-buying programme this autumn, and could start raising interest rates around six months later.

The fall-out from the Budget was also much in evidence in London, particularly among gambling stocks after the Chancellor increased the tax on fixed odds betting terminals from 20 per cent to 25 per cent..

William Hill initially estimated a hit of £16million over a year but today increased that figure to £22million after clarification that the hike would also apply to revenues from lower-stake terminals such as fruit machines.

Shares in William Hill fell 7 per cent in the wake of the Budget announcement and were off a further 3 per cent today, down 9.65p to 341.85p and wiping £300million from its value since Tuesday night. Ladbrokes was off another 7.1p to 133.3p.



The pensions industry has also been battered after the Chancellor gave retirees the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.

Budget blues: Bookies took another tumble following tax changes in yesterday's 2014 Budget

Friends Life owner Resolution fell 14.6p to 320.3p as it warned of the impact on new business flows in the individual annuity market, although it insisted annuities will continue to be an important product and that overall the proposals were positive for the retirement savings market.

Legal & General steadied after an 8 per cent fall yesterday as Shore Capital said that companies such as L&G and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long-term as more people save.

L&G shares rose 2.7p to 213.9p, Aviva added 2.7p to 493.1p, Standard Life cheered 4.85p to 358.85p and the Pru gained 8.25p to 1347.5p.

Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues, lost more than half its value on Wednesday and was down another 6 per cent or 10.1p to 132.9p today.

The Budget's creation of a new £15,000 super ISA has been positive for shares in fund platforms and wealth managers, with St James's Place rising by another 14.7p to 880.2p today.

Also bucking the weak blue chip trend, energy supplier SSE topped the blue chip leader board with a 40.0p gain to 1,478.0p as broker Morgan Stanley raised its rating for the stock to overweight from underweight..

‘SSE is cheap versus peers ... The balance sheet is safe, we think dividends can be maintained even without energy supply profits, and EPS revisions have troughed. Capex reductions would be a positive,’ analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Broker comment also gave a boost to taxpayer owned lender Royal Bank of Scotland, up 1.7p to 303.2p.

Investec Securities raised its rating for RBS to sell from hold following a 17 per cent drop in its share price over the three weeks since the bank posted annual results.

‘RBS is a peculiar stock that, in our view, has a recurring tendency to benefit from irrational exuberance between financial reporting. Partly for this reason, we retain a tactical preference to be short into results, and neutral (with a positive bias) ‘in between’ when we perceive that upside risks are greater,' Investec analyst Ian Gordon said in a note.

Clothing retailer Next was also a strong gainer, up 115.0p to 6,695.0p after meeting expectations with an 11.8 per cent rise in annual profit, fuelled by booming sales at its online business.

Some analysts, however, reckoned the scope for further gains in Next was limited, with the stock having jumped some 24 per cent this year.

‘We view Next as a core holding, but with the shares valued at a premium to the sector, we believe the valuation is up with events,’ analysts at Investec Securities said in a note.

9.55: Insurers came under renewed pressure on the markets today after Chancellor George Osborne torpedoed the annuity industry in the Budget.

Osborne gave pensioners the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.



Legal & General fell another 2.6p to 208.6p, despite Shore Capital arguing that yesterday's 8 per cent sell-off was overdone because companies such as L&G and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long-term as more people save.

Fed watch: New US central bank boss Janet Yellen surprised traders by suggesting an interest rate hike could come by mid-2015

Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues, lost more than half its value yesterday and was down by another 11 per cent or 14.8p to 129.4p today.

The Budget's creation of a new £15,000 super Isa has been positive for shares in fund platforms and wealth managers, with St James's Place rising by another 32p to 897.5p today.



However, Hargreaves Lansdown fell back after surging 14 per cent yesterday - it was down 36p at 1450p.

The FTSE 100 fell 45.8 to 6,527.4, with insurers dragging on the blue chip index for the second day in a row.

However, global markets have fallen across the board after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.



The guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting $10billion (£6billion) from monthly bond purchases.

The message on rates sent Wall Street lower and the US dollar higher last night, and resulted in a weak session in Asia and falls in Europe this morning.

City commentators are mulling over the impact of Yellen's comments, including whether they were intentional or a slip of the tongue due to nerves at her first news conference as Fed boss.

'Fed chair Janet Yellen spooked the markets by suggesting we could see the first hike in interest rates in the middle of 2015,' said Craig Erlam of Alpari.



'Last night was a prime example of the market hearing only what it wants to hear and ignoring all of the caveats, which more often than not make the initial statement irrelevant. This mistake has been made repeatedly in the past and it appears traders have not learned from their mistakes.



'A great example of this was former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim last May that the Fed would taper [make cuts to its stimulus programme] 'later this year', adding that this was dependent on the strength of the economic data.



'In the end, the Fed did taper in December, but investors had convinced themselves that he was hinting at September, despite the economic data at the time being below par. On this occasion they chose to ignore the caveat and a lot got burned. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself next year.



Pensions shake-up: Insurers came under renewed pressure on the markets today after Chancellor George Osborne removed the need to buy an annuity

'Another interesting point here is that many in the markets have assumed for a while that the first rise in interest rates could come as early as the middle of 2015, so these comments from Yellen are only in line with expectations.



'Maybe a lot of the drop in the indices, and dollar rally and gold dive for that matter, can be attributed to the growing number of FOMC members that saw rates rising to 1 per cent by the end of 2015.'



Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: 'As expected the Federal Reserve last night shaved another $10billion from their monthly asset purchase programme, but it was the press conference after the initial decision which caused markets to sell-off sharply when Janet Yellen in her first post meeting press conference as Fed chair suggested about the course of interest rates that unsettled markets somewhat.



'Assuming a continuation in the current pace of tapering the bond buying program looks likely to end in the fourth quarter, and in answer to a question about when interest rates might rise the Fed chief suggested that a rise in rates might come as early as the second quarter of 2015, much earlier than markets had expected.



'Whether she intended to be taken so literally is open to debate but it was enough to prompt a sharp reversal, and as such we can expect to see a lower open in Europe this morning.



'The Federal Reserve also dropped its unemployment threshold target of 6.5 per cent, following the example of the Bank of England, and said it would look at a wide range of factors before taking any decisions on when to move on rates.'



Hewson added: 'While the Fed may have intended to be dovish by downgrading growth forecasts for 2014, the fact that the committee are even speculating about raising rates just over 12 months out would suggest that they remain confident about the pace and nature of the economic recovery, despite concerns about the recent bad weather on the US economy.



'This marked change of tone from previous meetings saw stocks drop, bond yields rise along with the US dollar, which hit its highest level against the euro in two weeks in the space of an hour.



'If Janet Yellen had intended to make an impression in her first meeting as Fed chairwoman then she certainly succeeded yesterday, begging the question as to whether she intended to come across as hawkish as she did.'



Jonathan Sudaria of Capital Spreads said: 'Overnight at the Federal Open Market Committee press conference, after a very dovish statement, when pressed about rate hikes, Yellen spluttered out a date of possibly six months after the end of tapering.



'Blindly, everyone has calculated that with tapering at $10billion a month, six months after that would be mid 2015. However, this doesn’t tally with the tone of the words of the statement and one wonders if a bit of stage fright took hold of her in front of the glare of the cameras for the first time.



'After removing the 6.5 per cent unemployment threshold to allow loose monetary conditions to persist even longer, it wouldn’t make sense to then blind side markets with the threat of an imminent rate hike nearer than anyone had forecast. Expect regional Fed members to be doing the media circuit trying to finesse what she actually meant.'



8.55: The FTSE 100 opened down 30.9 points at 6,542.2, tracking a drop in global equities after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could raise interest rates much sooner than expected.

New central bank boss Janet Yellen sent US stocks and bonds tumbling after suggesting that interest rates could rise by mid-2015, pointing to a more aggressive push towards normalising the cost of borrowing than anticipated.

Yellen cut the Fed's bonding buying stimulus programme by a further $10billion to $55billion a month, and suggested it could be wound up entirely by this autumn.

Market watch: Traders were rattled by Fed boss Janet Yellen's suggestion of aggressive moves towards normalising US interest rates

The Fed sought to help the US recover from the financial crisis by launching a vast stimulus scheme, which generated plentiful cheap money that has boosted stock markets all over the world in recent years.

Its gradual withdrawal, which began last December, has prompted investors to pull money out of emerging markets and caused volatility across many other asset classes.

The US Dow Jones index slid 114 points to finish at 16,222.2 yesterday, while Japan's Nikkei fell 187 points to close at 14,224.2 overnight.

Yellen's comments were made after the European market close, but the FTSE 100 closed 32.15 points lower at 6,573.13 yesterday following the Budget.

The company said it fell below the main capital threshold in the Federal Reserve's stress test because of greater real estate losses and risk-weighted assets, and lower revenue estimates.

The central bank determined the bank had significantly higher commercial real estate losses and Significantly greater risk-weighted assets. Regulators also found that the bank would have lower pretax, pre-provision net revenue under economic distress, according to the statement.

Zions also noted that its original submission to the Federal Reserve occurred prior to the sale of certain collateralized debt obligation securities in January and February 2014, which sales also resulted in a substantial reduction in risk.

Business News###1671||Empty###1672||According to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is not public yet, Toyota Motor Corp. has reached a settlement to put an end to a criminal probe related to false or incomplete disclosures of safety issues in the U.S. Both the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney headed the investigation, which attracted national attention in 2009.

The settlement is estimated to about 1.2 billion dollars and is expected to be officially announced by the Justice Department later on Wednesday.

One of the analysts working for the auto researcher Kelley Blue Book – Mr. Karl Brauer said in a telephone interview that was cited by Bloomberg: “It’s a big number to pay and yet Toyota’s also a company that can most easily digest that kind of a number and move forward.”

The settlement, if actually reached, will put an end to a four-year investigation that is said to be finalized with one of the biggest fines the auto manufacturer ever got. The investigation put a stain on Toyota Motor Corp.’s name, which seriously affected its attempt to become the best selling car manufacturer in the world. The settlement would also help the company improve its positions on the market.

Julie Hamp, who is a spokeswoman of Toyota, said in a statement, which was cited by the Wall Street Journal: “Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years. During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Ms. Jerika Richardson, who is a spokeswoman of the Manhattan Attorney Preet Bharara refused to make any comments on the rumours whether such a settlement has been reached. The spokeswoman of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York – Kelly Langmesser also declined to comment the situation.

Toyota Motor Corp. settled on Wednesday at 5 508 yen, down 0.76%, marking a one-year change of +11.50%. The world’s largest auto manufacturer is valued at 19.14 trillion yen. According to the Financial Times, the 23 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Toyota Motor Corp. have a median target of 8 000 yen, with a high estimate of 9 600 yen and a low estimate of 6 200 yen. The median estimate represents a 44.14% increase from the previous close of 5 550 yen.###1673||17.15 That is where we are going to close the blog for today.

Mixed close of markets

16.52 Europe's main stock market indices closed mixed on Thursday, with the London's FTSE 100 sliding 0.47pc to 6,542.44 points.

In Paris the CAC 40 climbed 0.46pc to 4,327.91 points, while the Dax 30 in Frankfurt added 0.21pc to 9,296.12 points.

US interest rate concerns weighing on markets

16.27 Ahead of European markets closing, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, takes a look at trading today.

UK and European markets spent most of the day bogged down in US interest rate concerns only to follow US markets higher after the Philadelphia Fed Index came in at 9 months highs with a sign that US business sentiment is improving.

The FTSE dipped briefly below the March 14 low at 6500 before recovering almost all the sessions’ losses tracking US markets higher after the positive Philly Fed and conference board data.

The Dax has been showing relative strength over the FTSE this week since tensions eased in Ukraine with a small decline yesterday and subsequent bigger percentage bounce today.

Wall Street recovers, FTSE claws back gains

15.50 US stocks fell sharply during Janet Yellen's testimony yesterday, but are rebounding this afternoon.

• The Dow Jones is up 0.37pc at 16,282

• The S&P 500 is 0.29pc up at 1,866

• The Nasdaq is 0.16pc higher at 4,315

Breaking: Fitch says UK upgrade to AAA rating 'unlikely in the near term'

15.25 The UK's gold-plated credit rating isn't returning any time soon, according to Fitch

The agency says that although the economy is improving, "the UK's fiscal challenge remains large relative to most high-grade sovereigns". It adds that most of the remaining deficit reduction will be left to the next parliament, "making it somewhat less certain".

Here's the full statement

IFS questions Budget figures

14.30 Here's the bombshell graph from that IFS report - the Government's change to pension rules, allowing people to withdraw their pots instead of buying annuities, will increase borrowing in the long term rather than lowering it, as the Office for Budget Responsibility said it would yesterday.

This is because there is only a short term boost from a rush of pensioners taking their money out, which is taxable.

14.15 The IFS presentations are out (you can find them here)

A couple of slides of note: Firstly, the think tank using smileys to assess whether policy announcements add up:

Secondly, the number of taxpayers that will be dragged into paying the higher rate will climb above 5m soon:

13.30 The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the think thank, has raised questions over the OBR's sums around how much income the Treasury will receive from liberalising pensions.

The IFS's Paul Johnson said the expected higher income from pensioners drawing down taxable lump sums depend "on highly uncertain behavioural assumptions about when people take the money".

He added that allowing pensioners to access their entire pot would be potentially risky, and that those aged 60-65 tend to underestimate their own life expectancy.

New US unemployment claims rise, but point to stable jobs market

13.00 320,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, according to the US Labor Department.

This was up from 315,000 the previous week, but suggests underlying strength in the jobs market, according to economists.

The four-week mobing average, deemed a more reliable indicator, fell to 327,000, the lowest level since November.

Trader fined £662,700 for attempting to manipulate QE

12.25 A City trader has been fined £662,700 for driving the value of a government bond higher with the intention of selling it to the Bank of England as part of its quantitative easing scheme.

The Financial Conduct Authority has handed the fine to Mark Stevenson, a bond trader with over 30 years experience.

The FCA says that on October 5 2011 he deliberately raised the price of the gilt by buying into it, in the knowledge that the Bank of England would be buying bonds later that day.

Here's FCA head of enforcement Tracey McDermott's statement:

Stevenson's abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and, ultimately, for UK tax payers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions.

Odds almost even on Mulberry takeover

12.00 Mulberry's CEO Bruno Guillion is out the door this morning, and somewhat insultingly, the market likes it - shares are up 2pc as of midday.

Paddy Power has put together the odds on the company's future, and is offering 11/10 on the company being taken over by the end of the year.

Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) and Kering are Paddy Power's favourites to dip into their pockets and buy Mulberry, both at 3/1.

Mortgage lending rises 43pc in a year

11.20 With Help to Buy now due to continue until the election after next, the housing revival looks set to continue for some time. Today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show a 43.1pc rise in the value of mortgage lending between February 2013 and February 2014.

February lending of £15.2bn was the best February performance since 2008. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the data highlights the need for policymakers to keep an eye on prices:

Once strong upward momentum has developed in the housing market, it can be hard to stop – especially if interest rates are unlikely to rise markedly.

We expect house prices to increase by around 8% in 2014 with gains across the country. Furthermore, there is a genuine possibility that this could prove to be a conservative forecast particularly if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is increasingly supported by the “Help to Buy” mortgage guarantee scheme.

FTSE now falling below 6,500

10.50 The stock market remains weak, with the FTSE 100 now down 1.2pc, or some 78 points, at 6,494 after the Fed last night sparked fears about sooner-than-expected interest rate rises. Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at spread-betting firm IG, said:

Sometimes all it comes down to is a single sentence. Janet Yellen will be pondering over her performance last night, after she spooked markets with talk of an earlier-than-expected rise in US interest rates.

Although the Fed’s statement implied there would be a ‘considerable’ gap between the end of QE and the first rate hike, Yellen’s definition of considerable as ‘around six months’ wasn’t as long as some had hoped.

Barnier: Banking union will 'put end to massive bailouts'

10.00 The EU banking commissioner Michel Barnier says the agreement on banking union was reached at 7am this morning after 16 hours of negotiations.

Today's compromise allows us to complete the architecture of the banking union for the eurozone. This would not have been possible without the assiduous work and spirit of compromise demonstrated by both co-legislators

He said that banking union will create financial stability and mean banks will not require huge bailouts funded by taxpayers any more.

Together with the reforms to the financial sector for all 28 countries, the completed banking union will put an end to the era of massive bailouts. It will further contribute to the return to financial stability thus creating the right conditions for the financial sector to once again lend to the real economy which is essential to consolidate the economic recovery and to create jobs.

William Hill: Budget will cost us more than we thought

09.45 One big loser from yesterday's Budget was a triple tax whammy on bookmakers, including a higher 25pc tax rate on controversial fixed odds betting terminals.

Yesterday, William Hill said the increase would cost it £16m, but it has revised this today, saying it will be £22m.

Shares in William Hill are down 2.7pc while Ladbrokes has fallen 4pc.

Deal reached on EU banking union

09.20 The European parliament says it has reached a deal on banking union in the eurozone to create a new agency that will monitor the health of banks in the single currency.

According to Reuters, a fund for the union will be built up out of bank levies over eight years.

Banking union will be a new regulatory system designed to prevent failing banks from throwing economies into crisis.

FTSE continues slide

09.00 The FTSE 100 is now down 44 points, or 0.7pc, at 6,528 as investors take fright at the prospect of interest rate hikes in the US. Gerard Lane, economist at Shore Capital, said:

The Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in the post-FOMC conference gave a shock to investors by suggesting that the gap between the end of QE tapering, scheduled at the end of October, and the first interest rate rise could be ‘around six months’. Given the market expectations were towards the end of 2015, for markets to consider an interest rate rise in the April 2015 resulted in sharply higher bond yields.

Dollar gains ground on sterling

Osborne: More difficult decisions will be required

08.30 George Osborne has been on Radio 4 speaking about yesterday's Budget. He says policies to reduce energy bills for businesses are an attempt to put the UK on a level playing field with the rest of Europe:

We thought the European carbon trading scheme would work better than it did. The hard fact is that British businesses were going to be unable to compete with those on the continent. It will help many manufacturers who arent particularly energy intensive but do have high energy bills. We want to stay competitive create an economy where companies such as Hitachi choose to come to Britain.

More difficult decisions are required but I think we've shown we're capable of doing that. Public services have improved crime is down, we've protected the NHS budget so we've proved we've got the right approach to this. The big picture is we've got a long term economic plan that is working and brining economic security to Britain.

We don't manufacture enough, we don't export a lot, we don't save enough, we don't invest a lot and that's what future budgets are going to be about.

Company news: Hitachi makes UK its global rail HQ, Mulberry boss quits, Next profits overtake M&S

08.10 Here's today's biggest company news, including a big boost for UK manufacturing

• The Japanese electronics company Hitachi will move its rail business from Tokyo London, in a move to expand in Europe and the UK including on projects such as HS2. The transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin calls the move "an incredible vote of confidence in a growing Britain".

• The chief executive of fashion brand Mulberry says he is stepping down with immediate effect, without giving a reason. Bruno Guillon will be replaced by chairman and former chief executive Godfrey Davis.

• And annual profits at Next have overtaken those at M&S for the first time. Profits have risen from £667m to £695m - ahead of what Marks is expected to report.

FTSE opens down 0.5pc

08.00 The FTSE 100 has followed Asia down. It's trading at around 6,540 this morning - 32 points or 0.5pc off

Stocks fall after Yellen says rates could rise next year

07.30 You may have missed it with everything else going on, but the Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen dropped a bombshell last night, suggesting that interest rates in the US could be rising as soon as 12 months from now.

The US central bank continued to slow its bond buying programme by $10bn a month to $55bn from next month, and said it could stop purchases completely in the autumn. Yellen added that the Fed could start to rise six months after that. Our US Business Editor Katherine Rushton has more here.

This morning, the dollar has spiked, US bond yields have risen, and markets in Asia and Australia have fallen.

• The Nikkei has closed down 1.65pc

• Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.1pc

The FTSE 100 is expected to open up to 1pc down this morning.

Osborne dismisses idea that scrapping annuity requirements puts pensioners at risk

• Full story: savers and pensioners to benefit from tax overhaul

• Tables: How the Budget changes affect your income

• Budget key points at a glance

• Budget winners and losers

The Chancellor has batted away suggestions that scrapping the requirement to buy annuities is irresponsible. He told BBC News

People who have saved for their lives, these are responsible people capable of making good decision with good advice about their future

For many people annuities haven’t been good value they haven’t provided good incomes of what they’d hoped

Consumer groups would not be welcoming this if they didn’t feel it was a step in a positive direction

Here's Christian Adams' take on what Osborne pulled out of the hat yesterday

Good morning

07.00 Good morning and welcome to our daily business and markets live blog, your one stop shop for all the breaking business stories of the day.###1674||Alta Bicycle Share, the company contracted to run Portland’s much-delayed $4 million bike-sharing system, has responded to a report that its New York City network is going broke by saying it is seeking help from investors.

Without directly addressing the Wall Street Journal story, in which sources partially blame Alta for the 10-month-old Citi Bike system’s financial woes, the Portland-based company explained that it has “grown tremendously” over the past four years.

“We are seeking outside investors to help continue to accelerate the growth of our company as we continue to improve service for our existing clients and expand our existing systems,” Alta’s e-mail statement said.

It's unclear if the company is seeking financial support for just Citi Bike or its entire bike-sharing division.



The company, run by former city of Portland bike planner Mia Birk, also said bike sharing in U.S. cities and around the world remains strong. Alta already runs eight bike-sharing programs in the U.S. and Australia.



“Bike share systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco are growing and expanding, with more users and more trips every year,” the company said.

However, the Wall Street Journal paints a troubling picture of Citi Bike frantically trying to raise tens of millions of dollars “to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money.”

The story says that Citi Bike “has been forced to contend with a number of costly issues.” Among them: superstorm Sandy beating up equipment, software bugs and a rough winter that discouraged ridership.

Bike share pricing Portland has yet to announce the pricing for its proposed bike-sharing system. Here's the pricing for Citi Bike in New York City. * $95-a-year membership (with unlimited 45-minute rides). * $25 for a seven days. * $9.99 for 24 hours.

At the same time, advocates told the Journal that Alta hadn't done enough to improve the system and has basically ignored problems as they popped up. The story cites Alta's failure to get the bikes where they need to be, problems loading new batteries into charging stations and layoffs hampering customer service.

Alta's bike-sharing system in Portland would have 75 stations with 750 bikes, mostly in Portland’s central city.



One thing that should give Portland officials pause: Tourists aren't using Citi Bike as much as New York City had hoped. And when they do, many reportedly can't even use their credit cards with the high-tech sharing stations.

An analysis by The Oregonian earlier this month showed Portland is counting heavily on tourists to keep the local bike-sharing system afloat when it launches.

The Portland Bureau of Transportation has not responded to The Oregonian’s request for comment.



However, in a text message, Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees the bureau, said Portland is being deliberate about starting bike sharing. One reason is "that it gives us a chance to learn from other cities, so we'll see what we can learn from what's happening in New York," Novick said.



"Part of the problem in New York was the software, and we are using different software that has gotten good reviews from the other cities that have it," Novick said. "I talked to Mia (Birk) and asked her about the tourist issue, and she doesn't think it's true that tourist usage in NYC has been way lower than expected; I asked her for numbers and she said she'd get them to me."

Earlier this month, a messy bankruptcy involving an equipment supplier prompted Portland to once again delay launching the system in Alta’s hometown until 2015.

Alta made only a passing reference to Citi Bike’s financial problems. Instead, the company’s statement to The Oregonian focused primarily on the system’s popularity and growth:

“New York's Citi Bike has proven particularly successful. (Seven hundred) people joined in the last week alone, even with near freezing temperatures in New York. Citi Bike currently has over 99,000 Annual Members and average daily ridership of over 36,000 trips per day during the summer and fall. We look forward to working with our partners at the City of New York to ensure the program to continues to be a success, and to expand this convenient, healthy and fun form of transportation for all New Yorkers.”

It requested that future questions be directed to the New York City Department of Transportation.

On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Alta shouldn't count on the nation's largest city to pour money into Citi Bike.

Unlike Portland, which is depending on government grant funding to cover half of its bike-sharing project's startup costs, New York was able to get Citi Bike up and running with corporate sponsorships from CitiBank and MasterCard.

Meanwhile, David Bragdon, the former Metro Council president who now works as an executive director of Transit Center, Inc. in New York, took to Twitter to defend bike-sharing, pointing out that the nation’s highway fund is about to go belly up.

According to a New York City bicyclist and bike shop worker named “Matthew,” who sent an email to The Oregonian on Friday morning, Portland bicycle businesses should also be concerned about Alta setting up its rental kiosks.



He asked that his last name not be published.



His email also pointed out what he saw as problems with Alta’s public relations:

It's rarely mentioned, but the effect on bike shops is nearly catastrophic. Most bike shops rely on repairs as their most profitable source of income. And the bike share has cut into that dramatically. I'm an avid cyclist from the NW, living in NYC, and I'm surprised they're doing so poorly. It has been a long winter but regularly I ride by these stations and there isn't a bike there. How can they be losing money? Didn't the city give them the space to park? If so, how bloated is the hierarchy? I've only commented on two news stories ever. Both bike share in NYC. And previously the NY Times ran an article pre-launch about the program and tips on bike safety. The first thing in the article was a "safety tip" that had an Alta Bike safety coordinator saying, "If a taxi window is down, listen for the receipt printing because it's a clue the door may open." So I called and emailed this crew about how negligent that tip is! Was their any accountability? No! Did they ever once go onto a NYC street and listen for a receipt? If they did, they'd realize how idiotic that tip is. Borderline gross negligence. When was the last time a printing receipt harmed anyone? Never! And with all the different safety checks a cyclist must make, why would you lead a NYTimes article with a tip that doesn't work in actual practice? Because these are a bunch of college educated theorists who are afraid to get their hands dirty and understand what truly works and what doesn't. Instead they have theories and bar graphs and pie charts that include listening for printing receipts. They are lucky no one has died trying to hear a receipt only to be hit by a vehicle. And it's sad that these people stay employed. If it was the private sector they'd be broke. Instead they are in some swank office answering emails and seeing how much social media traction they have. Meanwhile, their bike wheels spin aimlessly.

For what it’s worth.

###1675||Empty###1676||Empty###1677||Empty###1678||New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has called for tough regulations to tackle practices such as co-location, which he claims give high-frequency traders unfair advantages and distort the market.

Schneiderman - who has been investigating HFT practices as part of an 'insider trading 2.0' campaign - has homed in on services offered by trading venues that benefit HFT firms at the expense of other market participants.



Speaking at a symposium in New York, the attorney general highlighted the practice of allowing traders to locate their computer servers within trading venues; providing extra network bandwidth to high-frequency traders; and attaching ultra-fast connection cables and special high-speed switches to their servers.



All of these practices are designed to give clients millisecond advantages, enabling them to make trades, often risk-free, before the market has time to react.



Co-location arrangements also help HFT firms to continuously monitor all the exchanges for large incoming orders. If a firm can detect a large order from an institutional investor - like a pension fund - it can instantaneously position itself on the other side of the trade, driving up the prices artificially.



This, in turn, forces big investors into adopting complicated and expensive defensive strategies like fleeing to dark pools to conceal orders from "parasitic traders", says Schneiderman.



The attorney general is calling on exchanges and regulators to look into changes that would see orders processed in batches rather than continuously to ensure that price rather than technology-driven speed decides who obtains a trade.



"Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets are becoming too focused on catering to them...It's long past time that we focus on structural reforms to help eliminate the unfair advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders," says Schneiderman.



The attorney general has already had some success in his crusade against HFT. Last July, under pressure from him, Thomson Reuters agreed to suspend its practice of providing traders with consumer survey results a couple of seconds before the information was given to other subscribers.



Since then, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has agreed to end its practice of systematically surveying Wall Street analysts for their sentiments on firms it covers in order to obtain advance information.###1679||Empty###1680||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

The latest possible lead came as the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace found of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people on board.

The new potential sighting was dramatically announced by Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, after he was handed a note with details during a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, scooping the official announcement from China.

"Chinese ships have been dispatched to the area," Hishammuddin told reporters.

China said the object was 22 metres long (74ft) and 13 metres (43ft) wide, and spotted around 120 km (75 miles) "south by west" of potential debris reported by Australia off its west coast in the forbidding waters of the southern Indian Ocean.

The image was captured by the high-definition Earth observation satellite "Gaofen-1" early on March 18, two days after the Australian satellite picture was taken, China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) said on its website.

It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search for the plane said.

The wing of a Boeing 777-200ER is approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base, according to estimates derived from publicly available scale drawings. Its fuselage is 63.7 metres long by 6.2 metres wide.

Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing.

Investigators believe someone on board shut off the plane's communications systems, and partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and re-crossing the Malay Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

That has led them to focus on hijacking or sabotage, but they have not ruled out technical problems.

REMOTE SEAS

Since Australia announced the first image of what could be parts of the aircraft on Thursday, the international search for the plane has focused on an expanse of ocean more than 2,000 km (1,200 miles) southwest of Perth.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said one of its aircraft reported sighting a number of "small objects" with the naked eye, including a wooden pallet, within a radius of 5 km.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion aircraft took a closer look but only reported seeing clumps of seaweed. It dropped a marker buoy to track the movement.

"A merchant ship in the area has been tasked to relocate and seek to identify the material," AMSA said in a statement.

The search area experienced good weather conditions on Saturday with visibility of around 10 km and moderate seas.

Australia, which is coordinating the rescue, has cautioned the objects in the satellite image might be a lost shipping container or other debris, and may have sunk since the picture was taken.

"Even though this is not a definite lead, it is probably more solid than any other lead around the world and that is why so much effort and interest is being put into this search," Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters, before latest Chinese image was reported.

China said its icebreaker "Snow Dragon" was heading for the area, but was still around 70 hours away. Japan and India were also sending more planes and Australian and Chinese navy vessels were steaming towards the southern search zone.

But the area is known for rough seas and strong currents, and Malaysia's Hishammuddin said a cyclone warning had been declared for Christmas Island, far off to the north.

"There are vessels heading in that direction. They may have to go through the cyclone," he said.

"Generally, conditions in the southern corridor are very challenging," said Hishammuddin. "The ocean varies between 1,150 metres and 7,000 metres in depth."

NO SIGN IN NORTHERN CORRIDOR

Where the missing plane went after it flew out of range of Malaysia's military radar off the country's northwest coast has been one of the most puzzling aspects of what has quickly become perhaps the biggest mystery in modern aviation history.

Electronic "pings" detected by a commercial satellite suggested it flew for another six hours or so, but could do no better than place its final signal on one of two vast arcs: a northern corridor from Laos to the Caspian Sea, and a southern one stretching from Indonesia down to the part of the Indian Ocean that has become the focal point of the search.

Malaysia has said the search will continue in both corridors until confirmed debris is found.

Hishammuddin said that, in response to a formal diplomatic request from Malaysia, China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan had all said, based on preliminary analysis, that there have been no sightings of the aircraft on their radar.

Aircraft and ships have renewed the search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas in the northern corridor that have already been exhaustively swept.

The Pentagon said it was considering a request from Malaysia for sonar equipment. The P-8 and P-3 spy planes, which the United States is already deploying in the search, also carry "sonobuoys" that are dropped into the sea and use sonar signals to search the waters below.

The search itself has strained ties between China and Malaysia, with Beijing repeatedly leaning on the Southeast Asian nation to step up its hunt and do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers.

For families of the passengers, the process has proved to be an emotionally wrenching battle to elicit information.

In a statement on Saturday, relatives in Beijing lambasted a Malaysian delegation for "concealing the truth" and "making fools" out of the families after they said they left a meeting without answering all their questions.

"This kind of conduct neglects the lives of all the passengers, shows contempt for all their families, and even more, tramples on the dignity of Chinese people and the Chinese government," they said.

Some experts have argued that the reluctance to share sensitive radar data and capabilities in a region fraught with suspicion amid China's military rise and territorial disputes may have hampered the search.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A congressional committee will meet in Fresno on Wednesday, taking up California’s drought crisis at the heart of the state’s agricultural region.

The House Natural Resources Committee will hear testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state water officials — all grappling with the drought. The hearing at Fresno’s City Hall is titled “California Water Crisis and its Impacts: The Need for Immediate and Long-Term Solutions.”

“It is my hope that we will hear more about common ground and solutions that will bring more water to this Valley instead of rehashing the tired, partisan battles over California water,” Rep. Jim Costa, a Democrat from Fresno who serves on the committee, said Tuesday in a statement.

California is in its third consecutive dry year. Gov. Jerry Brown in January declared a drought emergency, and in February President Barack Obama visited to see the crisis firsthand, delivering millions in relief aid.

Water officials said Tuesday that February delivered promising rain, but they predict having to dramatically cut back on the water that farmers receive from a pair of vast systems of canals, reservoirs and dams operated by state and federal authorities. Many Central Valley farmers say they will leave fields unplanted.

The Natural Resources Committee has 47 members. A fraction of members are expected to attend, including Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington, who chairs the committee, along with Costa and Rep. Tom McClintock.

In advance of the hearing Tuesday, several California Republicans in Congress sent a letter to Obama and Brown urging them to use their powers to help farmers and communities hit hardest by the drought. Strict regulations aimed at protecting endangered fish allowed 445,000 acre-feet of water from February rains to be lost into the ocean, the letter said.

California’s rainy season typically ends by April, said the letter signed by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who was among 13 to sign the letter.

“Given that communities in Central and Southern California are struggling to meet water needs and farmers are fallowing hundreds of thousands of acres of land that feed our state and country,” the letter said, “loss of this water is absolutely unacceptable.”

The video game retailer is getting zapped after the 800-pound gorilla in the retail world, Walmart, announced that it would start buying back used video games. Walmart’s CMO said starting March 26th, customers at 3,100 stores will be able to trade in Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo games. Credit from the trade-ins can be used immediately towards purchasing anything at Walmart, and Walmart intends to pay more for used games than other other buyer, including Gamestop.

The used video game market is huge for Gamestop, as it has dominated the space for the past 15 years, returning $1 billion in trade-in credits to customers just last year. Used games accounts for 30% of Gamestop’s annual sales, and nearly 40% of its profits. With Walmart setting its sights on this lucrative business, Gamestop fans are hoping it won’t be "GAME OVER" for the video game purveyor.

Today's Trending Ticker: Gamestop - Yahoo! Finance###1692||NEW YORK - Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it's also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well," Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers."

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer's $55 used version.

The new laws are minor adjustments to the sweeping pot regulations adopted last year.

The first measure requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

The second measure allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already must have state-level background checks, so the change is not expected to add any additional work for the CBI.

Gov. John Hickenlooper planned to sign the new laws Monday at the Capitol.###1701||Empty###1702||Why did this happen?

Shareholders had grown more optimistic after Oracle’s previous quarterly results, but still worried about slow IT spending and growing competition from smaller, nimble rivals.

On Tuesday, the company also forecast current-quarter results roughly in line with investors’ targets.

Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 3 percent and 7 percent in constant dollars, equivalent to between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Wall Street had expected $11.5 billion.

She told analysts on a conference call that she expected current quarter earnings of 92 cents to 99 cents per share, versus analysts’ consensus estimate of about 96 cents. New software and sales and subscriptions should grow between zero and 10 percent, she said.

“They still have heavy lifting ahead in order to declare this a turnaround story,” said Dan Ives, an analyst with FBR. “Investors need to see more. It continues to be a ‘prove me’ stock in the eyes of investors.”

The company said new software sales and Internet-based software subscriptions in its fiscal third quarter ended February 28 rose 4 percent from the year-ago period.

The company had forecast that new software sales and subscriptions would be up between 2 percent and 12 percent in the current quarter. New software sales are scrutinized by investors because they generate high-margin, long-term maintenance contracts and are an important indicator of future profit.

Software business still weak

Revenue from Oracle’s hardware systems products grew 8 percent to $725 million, the first increase since the software company’s $5.6 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

The hardware business recovery is a good sign but much less important than the company’s core software business, said Ives.

Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.

In response, four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products and acquiring smaller cloud companies like marketing software maker Responsys Inc.

“They moved in this direction significantly later than Microsoft for example,” said Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler. “They’re playing catch up, but they’re working quickly and they’re starting to make some progress.”

On Tuesday’s call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle’s total revenue.

On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company’s salesforce last year.

“We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now,” Hurd said. “We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and … they’ve been in place longer.”

Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.

Most of Oracle’s business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.

Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.

For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.

Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.

Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

And it is hard to look at the pictures, ubiquitous this morning, without a disgracefully touchy-feely, yes, I fear, even protectively feminine response. Isn't it sweet? Doesn't it have something perfectly reflective of our quirky national identity that the present pound coin roundly lacks?

Resurrecting the shape of the old threepenny bit is a stroke of genius. Note the universally positive reaction. Note, too, how uniformly well-schooled the broadcasters were in pronouncing it "thrupenny" as of old. The PR pack must have come with a pronunciation guide.

Hold on a moment, though. Is it not budget day? Why on earth launch a showy new pound coin with so much fanfare, when the real news is supposed to be the UK's superb growth projections, absurdly generous new subsidies for childcare and a thoroughly welcome rise in the income tax threshold, courtesy of Nick Clegg?

Seen in this light, the new threepenny-style pound coin looks suspiciously like a diversion. What giant new claim on our fast-depleting personal wealth is the chancellor going to spring on us that requires such an elaborate ploy? There's something disconcertingly April-foolish about it.

The official reason for introducing a new pound coin now is the estimated 45 million or so counterfeit ones that are in circulation. The old pound coin, as we must soon call it, was too simple to reproduce; a dodecagon represents a whole new challenge. Some, though, detect a different intention. The old pound, they suggest, looked too much like a euro coin for today's Eurosceptic sensibility. Nice timing, of course, in the run-up to EU parliamentary elections: Nigel Farage marshals his Ukip troops beneath his banner of limiting EU migration, while the Conservatives open their campaign meetings by flipping their new nationalist coin.

In another adroit piece of PR, there's to be a competition for the design of the non-Queen side. Public engagement is always a good idea. The one symbol likely to be ruled out, I imagine, is the thistle. Just in case.

Yet all enthusiasm for the new pound has tended to obscure some practical points. While the Royal Mint assures us that replacing one coin with another is not as expensive as we might think, this may be because much of the additional bill – £45m as someone estimated on Radio 4's Today programme (which eerily recalls the number of counterfeit pounds thought to be in circulation) – will, it seems, be paid by business, and by us.

A significant extra cost will be the replacement, or adaptation, of everything that requires pound coins at present. From luggage trolleys at airport and stations, to machines at the laundrette, to supermarket trolleys and slot machines providing everything from fizzy drinks to condoms. You also have to wonder how smoothly a 12-sided coin will be able to slip down its slot. One solution might be for the government to accelerate the withdrawal of the old coins as legal tender and have them sold back to us as tokens.

There is, though, a possible benefit from this change. Feeding pound coins into those super-fast gambling machines might seem more like spending real money than it does at present, and the new coins might periodically get stuck. Could it be that this has already been factored into the equation? As well as getting a patriotic rush from our new pound, we are to be saved from ourselves by other, stealthier, means.###1708||French satellites have spotted "potential objects" in the southern Indian Ocean, where a search is going on for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, the Malaysian government announced.

"This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities," Malaysia's transport ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

"Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

The source said the French image was captured Friday and was about 930-km north from where the Chinese and Australian objects were seen.

The official, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said one of the objects was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters by 13 meters.

The latest information was announced as planes and a ship scrambled to find a pallet and other debris in a remote patch of the Indian Ocean to determine whether the objects were from the jet that went missing for more than two weeks now.

Earlier on Sunday as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said there are credible leads in the case.

"Yesterday, one of our civilian search aircraft got visuals on a number of objects in a fairly small area in the overall Australian search zone," Abbott said.

The pallet was spotted by a search plane on Saturday, but has not been closely examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used on planes.

It is the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to run down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board.

Mike Barton, chief of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center, told reporters in Canberra, Australia, that the wooden pallet spotted by a civilian search aircraft was surrounded by several other nondescript objects, including what appeared to be strapping belts of different colors and lengths.

It was not immediately known if any pallets were used on Flight 370.

Several small objects were identified 2,500km off Australia's west coast, according to a statement released by the country's Maritime Safety Authority.

Sunday's search has been split into two areas, covering 59,000sq/km of ocean thousands of kilometres off the coast of Perth, the authority said.

Prayers for passengers

In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein put a message on his Twitter account Sunday asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.

More than 300 Malaysian cycling enthusiasts rode their bikes to the Kuala Lumpur airport to remember the people onboard the jet. The cyclists decorated the bikes with small Malaysian flags and stickers that read "Pray for MH370."

Beijing and Tokyo both sent two aircraft to join the six already involved in the operation backed by the US and New Zealand.

A total of 20 emergency service volunteers from western Australia will act as observers during Sunday's mission.

In Beijing, relatives of Chinese passengers, who are waiting for news about their missing plane, accused Malaysian officials of being "deceitful", adding that the meetings were a "waste of time," Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas reported.

Relatives said they feel Malaysian officials know more than they are saying, our correspondent added.

The Malaysian Airlines plane went missing three weeks ago.###1709||I am absolutely laughing my head off at the sheer stupidity of bureaucrats who think they can control social media.



Earlier today in response to Turkey Blocks Access to Twitter for National Security Reasons I commented ...



"No one will see the "power" of the Turkish Republic in idea suppression announcements. They will see the arrogance, cowardice, and desperation of prime minister Erdogan."



Twitter Use Breaks New Record



Tonight I am pleased to report Twitter Use Jumps to New High in Turkey

Turkish users of Twitter, including the country's president, have flouted a block on the social media platform by using text messaging services or disguising the location of their computers to continue posting messages on the site.



In what many Twitter users in Turkey called a "digital coup", Telecom regulators enforced four court orders to restrict access to Twitter on Thursday night, just hours after the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, vowed to "eradicate" the microblogging platform in an election speech.



The disruption followed previous government threats to clamp down on the social media and caused widespread outrage inside and outside Turkey. In a first reaction to the ban, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the European commission, tweeted: "The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is."



Štefan Füle, EU commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, said in a statement: "The ban on the social platform Twitter.com in Turkey raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards."



The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly rose to the top trending term globally. According to social media agency We Are Social the number of tweets sent from Turkey went up 138% following the ban.



On Friday, Turkey woke up to lively birdsong: according to the alternative online news site Zete.com, almost 2.5m tweets – 17,000 tweets a minute – have been posted from Turkey since the Twitter ban went into effect, setting records for Twitter use in the country. "Boss, my bird is still tweeting… @RT_Erdogan," posted @Fakir_Bey. "And yours?"



Meanwhile Twitter is looking into legal action against the ban and has hired a lawyer to discuss the case with the telecommunications authority in Ankara.Industry minister Fikri Isik said that Twitter needed a permanent legal representative in Turkey to facilitate all negotiations with the Turkish authorities.



Turkey's main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) also announced that it would challenge the blocking of Twitter in court, citing a violation of personal freedoms. The local bar association filed a separate criminal complaint against the ban.



Social media played a big role during last summer's anti-government protest, prompting Erdogan to call Twitter "a menace to society".



Several human rights groups strongly condemned Turkey's move, warning that the ban spelled a further worrying move towards increased authoritarianism in the country.



"The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey. The draconian measure, brought under Turkey's restrictive internet law, shows the lengths the government is prepared to go to prevent anti-government criticism," said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, in a public statement.

Arrogance, Cowardice, Desperation



So much for the extreme arrogance of Prime minister Erdogan who banned Twitter for "national security" reasons.



Erdogan told an election rally in the western city of Bursa "The international community can say this or that – I don’t care. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic."



Erdogan is a complete fool who is now officially "burnt toast". He is gone except by military force, and even that won't last.



Please tweet this post in the appropriate places, especially my comment (slightly modified) to fit tweet length ...

No one will see the "Power of the Republic" in Erdogan's announcement. They will see arrogance, cowardice, and desperation.



By the way, if you get the idea things are blowing up all over Europe, it's because they are.

NOW READ:###1711||It's déjà vu all over again in the more-than-two-week search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370: Today, like yesterday, Malaysian authorities announced that another satellite detected suspected debris near the spot they believe the 777 went missing.

This time it was a French satellite that spotted an object of interest in the southern Indian Ocean.

The New York Times reports:

" 'Australia, China and France have now released satellite images that show potential objects, which may be related to MH370, in the vicinity of the southern corridor,' said the statement. 'All this information has been forwarded to Australia, as the lead country in the area of concern.' "The ministry gave no other details about the image or its precise location. But the announcement appears likely to reinforce a belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane probably fell into the ocean off Western Australia after departing radically from its planned route. Investigators believe military radar and satellite signals indicate the plane cut across peninsular Malaysia, headed west over the Indian Ocean, and then possibly struck south toward where Australia has organized a search involving New Zealand and the United States. Britain, China and Japan have also sent military planes and ships to aid the hunt."

Australia, for its part, continued the search. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement that a total of about 10 aircraft are scouring an area covering 59,000 square kilometers.

At one point yesterday, aircraft spotted "small objects of interest."

"A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed," the AMSA said.

Update at 1:06 p.m. ET. Radar Echoes:

The Star, from Malaysia, reports:

"France's foreign ministry clarified that the new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for MH370 came in the form of 'satellite-generated radar echoes,' Reuters reported. "A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back."

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The traded-in games will be refurbished and made available to buyers later this year.

Retailers such as Best Buy Co, Target Corp and GameStop Corp also offer trade-in programs for used video games.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

How it Works

Walmart’s video game trade-in program is easy.

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.

Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year

Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned” which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.

Walmart’s Trade-In Continues to Grow In-Store and Online

Walmart’s in-store video game trade-in program builds on its existing trade-in offerings. In-store, customers can trade in tablets and smartphones and apply the trade-in value towards the purchase of a new device. Online at www.walmart.com/gadgetstogiftcards, customers can receive credit for a larger range of products such as MP3 players, cameras and laptops, in addition to smartphones, tablets and video games.

In this March 16, 2014 satellite imagery provided by Commonwealth of Australia - Department of Defence on Thursday, March 20, 2014, a floating object is seen at sea next to the descriptor which was added by the source. Australia's government reported Thursday, March 20, 2014 that the images show suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating in an area 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth Australia.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia's southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia's capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."

News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.

"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.

But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don't have — the location of MH370."

Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).

Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.

"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.

The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.

Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."

Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.

Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.

Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.

Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association told The Associated Press.

"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.

The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.

Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.

The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.###1721||Warning - there was an unexpected script error.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it's also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well," Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers."

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer's $55 used version.

"You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing," Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular "Gears of War" franchise, said last year###1726||Empty###1727||An early surge on the stock market evaporated Friday, as health care stocks tugged major indexes down.Biotech companies were especially hard-hit after U.S. lawmakers questioned the pricing of a Hepatitis C drug made by Gilead Sciences.The Standard & Poor's 500 index raced past an all-time high in early trading, then lost steam in the afternoon.

As the search continues for possible wreckage of the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, the transcript marks a further piece of evidence in the baffling mystery of flight MH370. It shows that -- according to numerous experts-- the two-way banter between Fariq Abdul Hamid, the co-pilot, and air traffic controllers was "perfectly routine."

The report focuses on two parts of the communication. During one portion, a message from the cockpit repeats that they were cruising at 35,000 feet. In another portion, the plane lost contact and changed direction just as there was a changeover among air traffic controllers, according to the UK paper.

But the run of messages between MH370 and the ground involved routine calls between the cockpit and air traffic controllers and gives no hint of the drama that was to follow. It is believed Hamid, as co-pilot, was the sole communicator.

An international search effort is underway to find the missing jetliner. There were 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board when the Boeing 777 lost contact on March 8. This week, the search has focused on a remote area of the Indian Ocean after two large objects, possibly debris, were spotted by a satellite.###1729||Empty###1730||The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration is warning taxpayers to beware of phone calls from individuals who claim to represent the Internal Revenue Service, but in reality are trying to defraud them, in what it is saying is the largest ever scam it has seen to date.

“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” said TIGTA Inspector General J. Russell George in a statement. He noted that TIGTA has received reports of over 20,000 contacts and has become aware of thousands of victims who have collectively paid over $1 million as a result of the scam, in which individuals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials.

“The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming,” said George. “At all times, and particularly during the tax filing season, we want to make sure that innocent taxpayers are alert to this scam so they are not harmed by these criminals. Do not become a victim.”

George urged taxpayers to heed warnings about the sophisticated phone scam targeting taxpayers, noting that the scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every state in the country. Callers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.

The truth, TIGTA pointed out, is the IRS usually first contacts people by mail—not by phone—about unpaid taxes. The IRS also won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer, and the agency won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone.

“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” said George.

The callers who commit this fraud typically use common names and fake IRS badge numbers, TIGTA noted. The scammers also frequently know the last four digits of the victim's Social Security Number make the caller ID information appear as if the IRS is calling, making the scam even more convincing. In addition, they tend to send bogus IRS e-mails to support their scam, and call a second time claiming to be the policy or department of motor vehicles, and the caller ID again supports their claim.

TIGTA said that if you receive a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS asking for a payment, here’s what to do. If you owe federal taxes, or think you may owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions. If you don't owe taxes, call and report the incident to TIGTA at 800-366-4484. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov. Add "IRS Telephone Scam" to the comments in your complaint.

TIGTA and the IRS are encouraging taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name. The IRS said it will never request personal or financial information by email, texting or any social media. Taxpayers who received scam e-mails should forward them to phishing@irs.gov, but they should not open any attachments or click on any links in those emails.

Taxpayers also should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes winner) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS.

Australian authorities are leading an international search along a southern arc for Flight MH370, which vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board after taking off for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

Photo: AAP

The objects were spotted by the Chinese aircraft from 33,000 feet, as it was heading back to Perth.

Drift modelling was undertaken on the sighting but the P-8 was unable to relocate the reported objects.

The Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft spotted two relatively big floating objects and several smaller white ones dispersed over several kilometers.

The official Xinhua news agency carried the report, saying the "white and square" objects were spotted by searchers aboard a Chinese Ilyushin jet. Two floating were "relatively big" and there several smaller white ones dispersed over several kilometres.

The crew reported the co-ordinates as 95.1113 degrees east and 42.5453 south to the Australian command centre as well as Chinese icebreaker Xuelong, which is en route to the area on Monday, AFP reports.

However, Australian authorities later said the US Navy had been unable to find the objects.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said its search area also continues to be based on US satellite images of two floating objects taken on 16 March.

Chinese aircraft join search

Chinese aircraft joined nine others from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan on Monday in the search of remote seas 2500km off Western Australia, where it is thought the plane may have crashed.

The search took on a new dimension after the French said on Sunday they had picked up images of possible aircraft debris some 850km north of the present search area.

Two Chinese military aircraft, two Australian P3 Orions and two ultra-long range civilian jets were the first to search the site on Monday. Another ultra-long range jet, a US Navy P8 Poseidon and two Japanese P3 Orions would go later in the day.

Australian Navy tanker HMAS Success is also searching and several Chinese ships are on their way to help find any objects spotted from the air.

Tropical Cyclone Gillian, near Christmas Island, could bring bad weather south, hindering search efforts.

New theory on malfunction

A new report says military radar shows the plane turned as much as 180 degrees and dived to about 4000 metres - a height at which people can breath without oxygen masks - when it turned from its route to Beijing.

The new detail may support a theory that there was a major malfunction, such as a cockpit fire. Military radar tracking shows that the aircraft changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation into the missing flight told CNN.

The plane flew as low as 4000 metres at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The sharp turn seemed to be intentional, the source told CNN.

The official said the area the plane flew in after the turn was a heavily trafficked air corridor and that flying at the lower height would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic.

NZ crew remain hopeful

The crew of a New Zealand Air Force Orion remains upbeat, despite another failed attempt to find the airliner. The Orion returned to its base in Western Australia about 4.30am on Monday after its latest search.

RNZAF Squadron Leader Brett MacKenzie was on board that flight and said spotting debris from the air is a difficult task.

"You're travelling in an aircraft that's doing 200 miles per hour. The world is whistling past you and you're looking for an object in amongst the whitecaps. You've got to be concentrating constantly - two, two-and-a-half hours - so a couple of moments of inattention you might miss something that's important."

The search on Sunday was hampered by thick fog and cloud, but acting chief of the Air Force Air Commodore Mike Yardley said the Orion's crew haven't given up hope of finding the airliner. He said searchers have been buoyed by the news radar echoes from a French satellite showing possible debris in the search area have been passed to Australian authorities.

"They think with the weight of evidence they're seeing from the operations staff briefing them that they are in the right area and they're determined to go out there and find something."

Air Commodore Yardley said New Zealand has been asked to provide more staff to analyse data from satellites and search planes. "Weather conditions were not great. We had sea fog right down to the surface of the water in half the area; then 600 foot of cloud in the other half of the area - so not great searching conditions."###1733||Empty###1734||Walmart Will Offer Store Credit for Used Video Games Starting March 26th

GameStop has gone a long time controlling the used games market, probably too long. Thankfully, a juggernaut is preparing to wage war.

Walmart has announced that it will be offering customers store credit for used games starting on March 26th. The announcement says the following:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, the more than 110 million gamers across the country will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition starting this summer. This is a new category for us and something our customers have been asking for.

GameStop has made a killing from used games, owing $2.4 billion in sales during the 2013 fiscal year. To put that in perspective, that's more than a quarter of its revenue stream. To say that GameStop executives consider used game sales an important part of the company would be an understatement.

The market has gone a long time without any proper competition. Walmart can be a serious player with its traffic, giving sellers a chance to turn their used games into store credit for more than one store (Walmart and Sam's Club).

Now that Best Buy, GameStop, and Walmart are competing for your used games, the days of being offered $20 for a one-week old game may soon be over.###1735||There are several points of consideration that will affect a premium spike. They would vary by region, state, and carrier; areas with sicker, older people are likely to be hit harder, according to insurance officials. States that are doing well in terms of overall enrollment would be less likely to see hikes. At the same time, some companies apparently underpriced their plans last year with the intent of hiking them this year regardless, and others will keep prices low to stay competitive. State insurance departments may also limit how much insurers can raise prices.

More importantly, industry officials don't yet have enough information on their new customers. Jay Gruber and David Cutler, health policy experts who assisted with Obamacare, told The Hill they expect prices to rise — because they always do — but how much depends on how big insurers think the exchanges will be. Three bits of information will influence their perceptions:

How many people have enrolled in their plans and how old are they? How sick (or healthy!) are those enrollees? How much will the risk corridors pay out if the companies has too many sick enrollees?

The officials interviewed by The Hill said the industry is "pessimistic" when it comes to the surge of enrollments by young people that the administration predicts. Which makes this a little premature, since insurers won't know how many young people have enrolled in plans by March 31 until after March 31.

As CNBC found last week, insurance companies have been scrambling to figure out how sick their new customers are. “The insurance executives understand this is a brand new group of customers they know very little about,” Ceci Connolly, managing director of the Health Research Institute at PricewaterhouseCoopers, told CNBC (emphasis added). As The National Review explained:

[T]he health of the actual enrollees — and therefore what they cost insurers — is what’s going to determine whether predictions about the enrollees were accurate, which determines whether insurers lose a bunch of money on the exchanges this year, and whether they have to raise premiums a lot next year.

The Review argues that Obamacare makes it "woefully difficult" for insurers to find this out. Some insurers, like Wellpoint, predicted their enrollees would be older and won't be taking any big hits. If only 33 percent of enrollees are in the 18- to 34-year-old range, as the Kaiser Foundation found in December, insurers would have to raise premiums by one percent. If the enrollment rate stays at a lower 25 percent, it's hard to see how that would justify tripling premiums.

When the insurers do know how sick or healthy their customers are, they'll know if their estimates were right. If they have more healthy people than they predicted, they'll pay into the risk corridor program, a pool of money meant to keep insurers from having to raise rates. If they have too many sick people, they'll get paid by the system. (Federal health officials have limited how much the government can pay out to insurers.)###1736||surged to new intra-day high levels on Tuesday after opened on a positive note following postive global cues.

Investors even as breathed easy as Ukraine concerns eased over the situation in Crimea even as the region voted in favor of quitting Ukraine.

Investors picked up banking on Tuesday as heavyweight banking rallied in early trades.

US stocks rose more than 1 percent on Monday, rebounding from a steep drop in the previous week as concerns eased over the situation in Crimea, even as the region voted to join Russia.

The 97-percent vote in Crimea in favor of quitting Ukraine was condemned as illegal by Kiev and the West, with the White House calling Russian actions "dangerous and destabilizing," though the referendum passed without violence.

In addition, while are considered to be vulnerable to further developments in what is considered the biggest crisis between Russia and the United States since the Cold War, anticipated sanctions against Russia have yet to materialize.

Asian shares rose on Tuesday and the yen remained well off recent highs as the threat of immediate military conflict in Ukraine receded, though investors remained cautious ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve policy meeting.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added about 0.3%.

Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1%, recovering from a six-week closing low hit on Monday.

For the time being, risk appetite improved as the likelihood of immediate military conflict faded, and participants turned their attention back to the US economic outlook and the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting on Wednesday.

The Fed is expected to continue to stick to reducing its monthly asset purchases by an additional $10 billion, and could also alter its forward guidance in its statement.

Fed policymakers could adopt less specific language to describe conditions under which it might tighten policy, instead of the bank's current threshold of a 6.5% unemployment rate for considering a rate rise. The rate now stands at 6.7%, though Fed officials are still signalling that rates need to stay low for some time to support the economy.

The euro edged up about 0.1% to $1.3932, within sight of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 touched on Thursday.

The single currency's resilience was despite data on Monday showing a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to back the view that the European Central Bank needs to take further monetary steps to support growth.

The improvement in risk sentiment took a toll on gold, which hit a six-month high on Monday before plunging more than 1%. It was last down about 0.4% at $1,360.21 per ounce, well shy of the previous session's peak of $1,391.76.

US crude edged down 0.1% to $97.97 a barrel, falling for the second day in a row, as expectations of growing petroleum stockpiles in the world's biggest oil user offset any fears that Ukraine tensions could worsen.

Reuters

Security software maker Symantec has terminated the services of its President and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such decision by the company in a span of two years.

The company, however, did not disclose the reasons for the move.

Symantec has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO with immediate effect.

"This appointment follows the termination of Steve Bennett as the company's president and CEO and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors," Symantec said in a statement.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, it added.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman Daniel Schulman said.

Bennett was roped in to head the US-based firm in July 2012 when its then President and CEO Enrique Salem was asked to leave the company after a 19 year association with Symantec, including three years as the CEO.

"It was the board's judgement that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO," Symantec had said.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with VERITAS Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation.

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

He will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its compensation and leadership development committee or nominating and governance committee.

Board member Robert S Miller will replace Brown as the chair of the compensation and leadership development committee.###1740||You are the owner of this article.###1741||The euro traded little changed against the Swiss franc on Tuesday before the ZEW Institute publishes data regarding economic sentiment in Germany and the Euro zone as a whole.

EUR/CHF slipped to a daily low at 1.2150 at 7:50 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.2153, down a mere 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 17th low, 1.2133, while resistance was to be encountered at March 13th high, 1.2168.

The gauge of economic sentiment for Germany probably slowed down to a reading of 51.8 in March, according to the median estimate by experts. Last month the index came in at a value of 55.7.

The index of economic sentiment for the Euro zone probably fell to 67.3 this month from 68.5 in February. The official results from the monthly survey by the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung) are to be announced at 10:00 GMT today.

Meanwhile, yesterday the annualized rate of consumer inflation in the single currency zone was reported to have weakened in February, which may put pressure on the European Central Bank to introduce new measures in order to spur economic growth.

The annualized HICP came in at 0.7% last month, a level last seen during October 2013, which was still far below central bank’s inflation objective of 2%, that provides price stability. Experts had anticipated that the annual inflation rate will remain steady at 0.8% in February.

On the other hand, safe haven demand for the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc was likely to be heightened, as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that he supported a request from Ukraine’s breakaway region of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, regardless of the imposed sanctions by the United States and the European Union.###1742||Walmart outlines new video game trade in program and used games plan

Walmart has been expanding its digital video offerings for a long time. The massive retailer operates its Vudu service and began to offer support for Intel’s UltraViolet DRM cloud video library late last year. Walmart has announced a new service for gamers that will launch this month.

Starting on March 26, Walmart will launch a new video game trade in program. Gamers will be able to bring their old and unwanted games into Walmart locations to trade the titles in and get immediate credit in the store. The store credit for the games will be usable for any purchase in the entire store.

That means you can trade in your old games and use the credit for food, clothing, gadgets, automotive service, or whatever floats your boat. The credit will also be usable at Sam’s Club locations as well. The trade-in program works like most others where the user can bring games in the original packaging to the electronics department.

The game will be inspected for damage and then the user will get a trade in value on the game. The credit is then given immediately and can be applied to purchases at checkout. The trade in program will be offered at 3100 stores across the nation. There is no indication of what the trade-in value on games will be. Walmart will also sell the trade-in games after they are refurbished.

The global Internet community rallied to help Twitter users in Turkey circumvent a block on the popular messaging service on Friday, as some experts said Ankara's efforts were backfiring.



After Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "wipe out" Twitter and the site went dark there Thursday, there was no lack of help from activists, Internet companies and others.



"Trying to ban Twitter has backfired," said Philip Howard, who heads the Digital Activism Research Project at the University of Washington.



"It's drawn the world's attention to the country's increasingly tough censorship and surveillance strategy."



Howard told AFP the Turkish move quickly became a "trending topic" on Twitter -- which prompted fresh criticism of the government.



"News of the ban seems to have driven more Turks to try Twitter out for the first time, breaking national records for Twitter use. Tip sheets for getting around the ban spread like wildfire," he said.



Shortly after Twitter connections were broken, the US-based social media giant posted a message reminding users they could get onto the platform through SMS text messaging.



Activists pointed to ways to tweak a computer's Internet settings to access Twitter.



And some firms offered access to their VPN -- a virtual private network which masks the user's information to circumvent the ban.



Around the world, #Turkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were big topics on the social platform.



'Flood' of tweets



Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina sociologist who is Turkish, followed the news in real time and posted a blog on how her compatriots responded.



"People circumvented, one by one, and then in a flood," she wrote.



"By the end of it all, most trending topics worldwide, and of course in Turkey, were about the blocking of Twitter, and of course, opposing it.



"Let alone be deterred, the number of tweets in Turkish and from Turkey were close to record-breaking levels."



Tufekci said Twitter has become so ingrained in daily life in Turkey that it may be impossible to hold back.



"Twitter is not just a protest tool in Turkey... it's an entrenched part of the networked public sphere," she said.



"The only people not on Twitter at the moment are ardent pro-government supporters who do not want to circumvent, and people who may not have the fairly minimal skill required to circumvent."



Some surveys suggest about one in seven Internet users in Turkey uses Twitter.



The ban on Twitter is the latest in a series of moves by Erdogan's government to tighten its control of the Internet, including banning thousands of websites.



The Turkish premier has come under mounting pressure since audio recordings spread across social media that appeared to put him at the heart of a major corruption scandal.



Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a frequent user of social media, led the chorus of calls against the ban. And activists around the world quickly denounced the Ankara government.



"The decision to block Twitter, a leading medium of communication in Turkey, is quite a dramatic step for a government that claims to be democratic," said David Kramer, president of the pro-democracy group Freedom House.



"It is a bold attempt to stop news of government corruption from getting out in the run-up to local elections. The government should immediately reopen Twitter and recognize that free, unhindered space for debate is essential in Turkey, as it is anywhere else."



Ban is 'futile'



Some activists and analysts said the ban was unlikely to succeed.



"While the ban seems futile, what it indicates is an increasingly authoritarian Turkey," said Jillian York at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.



Emily Parker, a New America Foundation fellow who has a new book on digital activism in authoritarian governments, noted that many people are able to use Twitter despite bans in countries such as China.



"Turkey may have an even harder time keeping people off of Twitter," Parker told AFP.



"Twitter is already extremely popular in Turkey, and has millions of users. It is difficult for authorities to take away Internet freedoms that people once enjoyed."###1747||Oh no! Page not found

07:49 pm: Search for `best lead` called off

The search in the Indian Ocean for the possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane has been called off due to bad weather.

Australian rescue officials, searching the `best lead` said that the operation will resume on Friday morning.

Four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the remote ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

06:34 pm: Malaysia preparing to recover the flight data and voice recorders

After more than 12 days of search operation for the missing flight MH370, Malaysia is now preparing for the need to conduct deep-sea searches to recover the flight data and voice recorders.

If the jet is confirmed to have crashed at sea, the next step is to actually find the black box, Transport Minister Hishammuddin said on Thursday.

Menwhile, searchers flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean hunting for debris in “probably the best lead” so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.

05:53 pm:`Not hiding anything about MH370`

Malaysian consul general in India Mohamed Hatimi Abas categorically denied today that his government had hidden any fact about the missing Malaysian Airline aircraft, during his visit here, as per PTI report.

"It is a wrong perception about our government. Since there were many possiblities linked to the plane`s fate, people took it otherwise. But, I want to tell you that we never tried to hide anything from the people," Abas said.

05:00 pm: Australian satellite image shows March 16 date

If one examines the satellite image provided by AMSA, the date inscribed on the picture is March 16, that is, four days ago.

However it is not yet officially clear when was the image captured.

Earlier, speaking in a news conference, Malaysia`s civil aviation department chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman confirmed that debris was received on Thursday, but was clueless on the timings when the satellite captured the image.

04:10 pm: UK sending HMS Echo to search the southern corridor

The UK Ministry of Defence has announced that it will send HMS Echo - a coastal survey ship - to help search the missing plane debris in the southern corridor, reported the BBC.

03:35 pm: Australia`s RAAF`S Orion unable to find the objects

AMSA news tweets that Royal Australian Air Force`s AP-3C Orion aircraft has not been able to locate the objects spotted by satellite, thought to be the plane debris as he clouds and rain hampered the search efforts by reducing visibility.

RAAF P3 crew unable to locate debris. Cloud & rain limited visbility. Further aircraft to continue search for #MH370 — AMSA News (@AMSA_News) March 20, 2014

03:20 pm: Four aircraft re-oriented to search the debris

Addressing the press conference, Malaysian minister Mr Husein said that four aircraft were involved in the search in the southern Indian ocean. He added that UK too, was sending a ship to help the hunt mission in the southern air corridor.

03:10 pm: We have a credible lead now: Malaysian minister

Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein says that the Ausralian satellite imagery has provided a credible lead.

"Every effort is being made to locate objects seen in the satellite images," he told a news conference. He adds that the images though "credible", may not be belong to the missing plane.

02:55 pm: US Navy`s Poseidon now flying over the area where objects were spotted

US Navy`s high-tech search aircraft P-8A Poseidon is now hovering over that area in southern Indian Ocean where the possible debris was spotted, said the BBC.

The aircraft is a well equipped long-range anti-submarine warfare, surveillance aircraft capable of broad-area maritime operations and will clarify whether the objects spotted on satellite imagery really belong to the missing jet.

02:30 pm: US Navy aircraft Poseidon`s radar hits not linked to suspected plane debris, says pilot

Dousing hopes that the US Navy`s high-tech surveillance aircraft P-8A Poseidon had captured "hits of significant size", the pilot of the aircraft has said that the radar hits are not believed to be linked to objects identified by Australia, reported the CCTV news.

02:10 pm: Missing jet hunt a `logistical nightmare`

Stressing on the extent of difficulty involved in locating the possible debris of the plane, Australia Australian Defence Minister David Johnston told Sky News that the operation was a `logistical nightmare`, reported the AFP.

"This is a terribly complex logistical operation to identify what we have found via the satellite."

Johnston added that the investigators were in a "most isolated part of the world".

"We are doing everything we can to try to solve this potentially tragic mystery."

01:40 pm: `Wish the plane has been hijacked`

For the kins of passengers on board the missing Malaysian airlines Flight 370, the wait is agonizingly endless. And the news of Australian debris sightings only added to their disbelief and distress. If the debris is confirmed to belong to the missing jet, it would end all hopes for the survival of the passengers.

So Zhang Xinyu, whose mother was on the plane, hopes that the plane was hijacked and is hiding somewhere.

Speaking to the BBC, he said,"I`ve heard about the new findings by the Australians in the south Indian Ocean. If it is anything, it would be a bad news for us all. We all wish that the plane had been hijacked and is being hidden somewhere."

12:45 pm: `Something down there`, says crew aboard US Navy`s Poseidon aircraft

The crew of US Navy patrol aircraft P-8A Posiedon have expressed strong indications of "something significant being down there", referring to the possible debris of the missing jet.

ABC News reporter David Wright, who is aboard the search aircraft, said that he was told that Posiedon`s radar signals are getting “hits of significant size” and “all indications something down there.”

12:30 pm: AMSA shares satellite images of possible debris

Australian Maritime Security Authority has shared new satellite images of the possible debris sighted in southern Indian Ocean.

12:00 pm: Best lead we have so far, says AMSA chief

Talking about the Australian sightings of the possible debris, AMSA chief John Young said, “This is a lead, it’s probably the best lead we have right now".

However, he cautioned that the objects could also be seaborne debris along a key shipping route where containers periodically fall off cargo vessels, reported the AP.

11:10 pm: US Navy`s Poseidon aircraft arrives in Australia to join the search

Meanwhile, the US Navy`s P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft has arrived in Australia to continue the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean.

"The search has expanded to the southern portions of the Indian Ocean and the P-8A has the range required to reach those waters," the Star Online quoted Lt. Clayton Hunt of Patrol Squadron (VP) 16, the search and rescue detachment mission commander.

11:00 pm: Malaysia deploying Navy ships to hunt for possible jet debris

To verify the information on the possible debris from the missing jet as suggested by Australian satellite imagery, Malaysia has deployed aircraft and vessels to help locate the objects in the southern Indian Ocean, Mlaysia`s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said today.

He added that six navy ships and three aircraft have been deployed to look for the objects, which might be the fresh leads in the hunt for the disappeared plane.

10:50 pm: AMSA hints at bleak possibility of debris belonging to missing jet

Reiterating Australian PM`s remarks, AMSA`s John Young too hinted at the bleak possibility of the debris belonging to the missing jet.

"We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat (satellite) images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good," he said.

As many possible debris findings earlier, have turned out to be false, the officials are exercising caution this time.

10:25 pm: Objects might not belong to the missing jet: Oz PM

Australian PM Tony Abbott said that he had informed the Malaysian PM Najib Razak about the possible debris being spotted by the Oz satellites. But downplaying the new clue, Abbott said that the search would be quiet difficult and the objects might not belong to the missing jet.

AMSA`s John Young also sounded a note of caution saying: "We have been in this business of doing search and rescue and using sat (satellite) images before and they do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good."

"The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370," Abbott said.

10:20 pm: AMSA shares details of the objects spotted

AMSA chief John Young is addressing a press conference sharing details about the object spotted on satellite imagery.

John Young says tells a press conference that the objects were located in the southern Indian Ocean about 2,500km (1,550 miles) south-west of Perth on Australia`s west coast.

He said that the objects were "of a reasonable size and probably awash with water and bobbing up and down over the surface".

He added that one of the objects is 24m long.

10:10 pm: Malaysia not sending assets to help search objects

Malaysia is not sending any plane to help locate the suspected plane debris and said that it is depending upon Australia for any trace of the objects that might be the parts of the missing plane.

9:50 pm: FBI assisting Malaysia to recover deleted data from flight simulator of pilot

After the Malaysian police found that data was deleted from he flight simulator of the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is helping to analyse the data.

US officials said that Malaysia had shared the data with the FBI experts and that they were trying to recover the data that was deleted from the flight simulator on Feb 3.

Orion will look for the objects in southern Indian Ocean and is expected to arrive today afternoon. Also, three additional aircraft are set to join the Orion in its search for what are being supposed to be the parts of the missing jet.

9:00 pm: Australia spots two objects on satellite imagery

In the latest information about the missing Malaysian Airlines plane, two objects that might be related to the Boeing 777, have been spotted by Australian satellite imagery, Australian PM said.

Australian PM Tony Abbott on Thursday told the Parliamnet that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)has received information based on satellite information of objects possibly related to the search.

"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified."

A flood of fake currency has prompted the Royal Mint to release a new "counterfeit-proof" £1 coin.

But how do you spot one?

There are estimated to be in excess of 30million fake pound coins in circulation.

It is illegal to use one and the Royal Mint says you must hand them in if you think you have been given one.

Depending on the quality of counterfeit, it can be difficult to tell the difference between a real and a fake £1 coin.

But there are a few key things to look out for:

1. The date and design on the reverse should match. It is changed each year and you can see a list of dates and designs here

2. Poor or missing lettering on the edge of the coin

3. The edge of the coin is uneven in depth

4. A coin which has been in circulation for some time but still looks shiny and golden and shows no sign of age

5. The colour does not match genuine coins

6. The Queen's head or reverse design look indistinct

7. Alignment - hold the coin with the Queen's head upright. Turn it over. The design on the other side should also be upright - fakes are often skewed

One coin expert believes although the number of fakes in circulation is increasing, they are getting worse.

"Quality is definitely dropping and fakes are now quite obvious, even to the untrained eye," Garry Day told the BBC.

* Short-term safe-haven bids for yen unwound after calm Crimean referendum

* IMM data shows long dollar bets pared

* China’s yuan weakens after trading band widened over weekend

By Anirban Nag and Patrick Graham

LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The euro held within sight of long-term highs against the dollar on Monday, resisting selling after a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

The dollar gained against the yen as European stocks and U.S. futures headed into positive territory, helped by the lack of any dramatic further developments in Ukraine after the Crimea region voted in favour of annexation by Moscow.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

The risk of flare-ups in tension between Russia and Ukraine has underpinned demand for safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc and some of the bets on those currencies left on ahead of the referendum were unwound on Monday.

“The yen has fallen after the Crimean vote but I would say many people are going to remain cautious,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“What we don’t really know about is what is going to happen to eastern Ukraine. So people are going to just watch the newsflow carefully.”

The dollar was up 0.45 percent at 101.78 yen, still within sight of a two-week low of 101.205 yen struck on Friday and compared to a 1-1/2 month high of 103.77 yen hit on March 7.

The euro was down less than 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3889, unchanged from morning levels after February inflation was revised lower. It has traded within about a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi knocked it lower by voicing concerns about its strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn’t weakened substantially,” said Foley.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

FEWER DOLLAR BULLS

The dollar has failed to deliver the strength predicted by many banks earlier this year, with the euro up four cents from late January lows.

Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed that speculators pared bullish bets on the dollar for a fifth straight week through March 11, with net longs falling to their lowest in more than four months.

Overall, though, investors have maintained net long positions on the dollar for 19 consecutive weeks. The last time speculators were short the greenback was in late October 2013.

A record drop in foreign governments’ holdings of U.S. Treasuries led some to speculate that Russia has been reducing its dollar reserves ahead of possible sanctions from the West.

Investors were also considering the implications of Beijing’s announcement on Saturday that it will double the daily trading range for the yuan. The step was viewed as a sign of confidence that the central bank had successfully fought off currency speculation.

“Nothing forced them to widen the band this weekend, so it will be seen as a continuation of long-term policy,” Citi strategist, Steve Englander wrote in a note. “I would see it as slightly risk-on. Small positive for the Australian dollar, small negative for the yen, but again a second-order impact.”

With Airbnb just days from closing a large new funding round that will value the company at $10 billion, its founders are about to become billionaires.

Cofounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia will all maintain personal stakes of just over 15% of the company after the dilution of this raise, according to knowledgeable sources, which will net Airbnb between $400 and $500 million. At about a $10 billion valuation, that makes each cofounder’s personal stake in the San Francisco-based company worth just over $1.5 billion, vaulting them into the ranks of the world's youngest billionaires.

The new round, which will close in the next one to two weeks, is being led by Fort Worth, Tex.-based private equity firm TPG Capital, with a number of other investors, not all of whom are expected to sign on at once, but in tranches over time, sources tell Forbes. Airbnb declined to comment on both the round and the cofounders' personal stakes.

Don’t expect Chesky, 32, Gebbia, 32, and Blecharczyk, 30, to go buy their own Necker Island anytime soon—those riches are still largely tied to Airbnb’s future in stock, and the founders prefer to live simply. Chesky and Gebbia, who first came up with the idea for Airbnb in 2008 as Rhode Island School of Design grads transplanted to San Francisco, still live in the same apartment in the South of Market neighborhood where they started the company. Blecharczyk, who joined early that year as cofounder and CTO of what was then called Airbedandbreakfast.com, still bikes to work, according to an Airbnb insider. And much like Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick has been known to drive cabs around town, Chesky will still list his apartment on Airbnb once in a while to personally test out the local listings.

“People providing these services in many ways are entrepreneurs or micro-entrepreneurs,” Chesky said in a Forbes cover story last year. “They’re more independent, more liberated, a little more economically empowered.”

Airbnb’s become a leader of the share economy, with over 600,000 listings across 160 countries used by millions of annual guests, and 11 million in its five-year history. The company says New Year's Eve 2013 it had a record 250,000 guests in one night; a guest checks somewhere in the world each 2 seconds. While Airbnb does not disclose revenue, it takes 3% from a host’s booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.

The trio’s first funding came in 2009, when they got into famed tech incubator Y Combinator and eventually impressed founder Paul Graham as well as Sequoia Capital, who put up $600,000 in seed funds after the program. The company’s raised money from a range of Silicon Valley elite investors since Sequoia, which was joined in a Series A round by Greylock, SV Angel, and angels including Ashton Kutcher. In 2011, it raised $112 million at a valuation north of $1 billion led by Andreessen Horowitz and joined by DST and General Catalyst Partners as well as Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos. The next year, it raised $200 million in a Series C round led by Founders Fund along with its existing investments in a deal that values the company around $2.5 billion.

Now the company’s sitting on a $10 billion valuation from private equity sources. No word yet whether existing investors have re-upped in the round, but an insider tells Forbes that it's unlikely that the founder or early investors will use this new raise to cash out and gain liquidity from their positions.

By turning to private equity sources for its latest cash and lofty valuation, Airbnb’s signaling that it’s taken another critical step in the life cycle of a private tech company. For TPG, it means a foot in what could prove an extremely popular eventual public offering, possibly later in 2014, while private equity funds often come with generous valuations and dilution concerns for founders looking for guidance as they begin to consider preparing for Wall Street investors.

Airbnb’s cofounders join Dropbox cofounder Drew Houston and WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton as recent tech entrepreneurs to join the billionaire ranks. When the round closes, Blecharczyk will become among the world's youngest, a group which includes Facebookers Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz and 24-year-old Hong Kong citizen Perenna Kei.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.68% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 to October 1, 2018. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

DATE LAST MODIFIED: May 18, 2018###1757||The Royal Mint, it seems, is admitting defeat on the battle with fake £1 coins and will, after 30 years, reinvent the coin as a new 12-sided coin, the "most secure circulating coin in the world".

Around 3pc of all £1 coins, of 45 million in circulation, are now forgeries up from 1pc or 15 million a decade ago.

The figure had risen from 2.74pc to 3.04pc in the last survey alone, in November.

Most of us only discover we have one when we go to put them in a parking meter and find they are rejected, others are more obvious.

The pound coin, made from a mixture of copper, zinc and nickel, was introduced in April 1983 to replace the £1 note.

Fake coins are largely made of lead and then sprayed with gold paint. This means that the weight often feels different to genuine pound coins and the surfaces are notably different.

The Royal Mint warns of warning signs:

• The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.

• The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.

• The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.

• Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.

• The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.

• The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.

What do I do with a fake coin?

Vigilance in the first place is your only hope. You decline a fake pound when it's given to you. It is an offence to try and pass the coin on. In theory, they should be handed to the police.

Banks will not refund those left holding fakes. This can be very costly for small shopkeepers who take their till takings to branches.

Based on the 3pc prevalence of fakes, nearly all of us will be handling at least a few fakes each year, often without knowing.

How does our fake problem compare with elsewhere?

The 5 rand coin in 2004 was reissued after taxi-drivers and shopkeepers in South Africa started to refuse to accept them. Fakes were just 2 per cent of all coins.

Previous estimates of euro coins suggest they are far harder to counterfeit. Only 0.1pc of euros – some 10m – were fakes, according to research in 2006. Fakes are more prevalent among €2 coins, the European Commission said last year.

Why will the new £1 coin be better?

The Mint said the new 12-sided coins will be made from two different coloured metals – as yet to be decided – and contain an "iSIS security feature". This is to do with the Integrated Secure Identification System developed by the Mint. It applies this existing security technology "that has been proven over decades in banknotes" to coins for the first time. Those are the only details released. The coins will enter circulation in 2015.

Russell Crowe, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood are among the celebs to tweet their objections to the Turkish government’s crackdown on the social media messaging service.

“Turkey has banned Twitter? That is a terrible decision. I don’t understand it,” Crowe tweeted.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blocked access to Twitter and vowed to “eradicate” it after recordings implicating him in a bribery scandal flooded social media. Erdogan’s Twitter smackdown sparked outrage around the globe, with #TwitterisblockedinTurkey blowing up.

“Is Twitter genuinely blocked in Turkey? If so, this is shameful and scary,” tweeted Wood.

Meanwhile, Farrow spread news of a way around the ban: “Hey there friends in Turkey! You can stay on twitter via VPN and Hotspot.”

Erdogan, who is trying to quell the corruption scandal ahead of key local elections, blew off condemnation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other countries.

“The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,” he said.

Turkey’s Internet watchdog has blocked access to YouTube in the past, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which was used to spark government protests last year.

Some users have figured out how to circumvent the ban using the site’s SMS service. On Friday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan’s, was among those to defy the ban.###1759||Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg Yves Mersch warned that failing to reach a deal on the last element of the banking union would be 'close to suicide'

Representatives from the European Parliament and several EU governments have reached a provisional deal on the last, contentious element of the banking union, which will shield taxpayers from bank bailouts.

The final piece of the banking union was agreed upon after marathon 16-hour talks, and includes a deal on a common system for handling bank crises.

Details of the Single Resolution Mechanism bill have not yet been announced officially as the main political parties in the European Parliament still need to approve the legislation before it can take affect.

However, reports from Bloomberg and the FT revealed that the deal has paved the way for the establishment of a single system to close down failing banks and a €55bn shared fund, which can assist troubled banks.

The SRM is the final part of the puzzle in the creation of a banking union which pools responsibility for eurozone banks, as well as the establishment of common financial oversight, which can strengthen the region’s resilience against any future debt crisis. According to Bloomberg, the first leg of the union also involves the ECB assuming full supervision of the currency bloc’s lenders in November.

EU politicians have fought to reach an agreement on the resolution system, which has faced strong headwinds for being too complex and inadequately funded. Recently, ECB board member, Yves Mersch even warned that failing to reach a deal would be “very close to suicide”.

A major point of contention has been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to contribute to the resolution fund – including how much money each state should put in the pot.

However, following the negotiations, it was agreed that the fund’s establishment would be accelerated to 10 years from now to eight years instead, making the common funds accessible at an earlier stage.

The deal is timely as negotiators have been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May, which could have delayed the deal until 2015.###1760||Empty###1761||The proposed merger of Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) is drawing regulatory scrutiny.

Sources tell Reuters that the attorneys general of a number of states are working with the U.S Department of Justice to review how the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger will affect the market for broadband Internet service.

Regulators are reviewing the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger to see if it complies with antitrust laws. The number of states that have joined in the federal review isn’t know, but Indiana is reportedly conducting its own evaluation of the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger’s impact.

Comcast has said it will shed 3 million cable TV subscribers to keep its share of the pay TV market under 30% in a bid to appease regulators. The Comcast-Time Warner cable merger must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission before it can go forward.

The $45 billion Comcast-Time Warner cable merger, announced last month, has drawn criticism that it will reduce competition, translating into higher charges to consumers.

CMCSA stock fell almost 1% in Wednesday morning trading, while TWC stock slipped slightly.

Vermont's unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average - the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state's unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers - the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

"The January numbers start the year on a positive note," Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. "Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth."

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February's report is due out in late March.###1763||The stock market looked ready to finish off a turbulent week with solid gains, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 index was on track to close Friday at an all-time high.

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,882 as of 11: 30 a.m. Eastern time. If that gain holds through the close of trading, it would mark an all-time high for the index. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 119 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,451. The Nasdaq composite slipped three points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,316.

COMPARE, CONTRAST: It might sound surprising that the stock market is trading at an all-time high with all the uncertainty surrounding China’s slowing growth and simmering tensions between Russia and the West. But these concerns also highlight the relative health of the U.S. economy and stock market, said Dan Veru, chief investment officer of Palisade Capital Management in Fort Lee, N.J.

“In a perverse way, these geopolitical issues drive home the fact that the U.S. has been overlooked. The U.S. was the first major economy to go into recession, and it’s the first major country coming out of recession right now.”

COMING BACK: A week ago, the S&P 500 index turned in a 1.9 percent weekly loss, its worst slump in nearly two months. This week looks entirely different, with the S&P 500 on track to gain 2.1 percent, as concerns have eased over China’s slower economic growth.

The only stumble came Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve said it could start raising short-term interest rates as soon as next year. Traders drove down prices for gold, government bonds and stocks.

GOLDEN GATE’S TOUCH: News that Golden Gate Capital has acquired a stake in Ann Inc. shot the retailer’s stock up $5.20, or 15 percent, to $42.43. The private equity firm disclosed the 9.5 percent stake in the parent company of Ann Taylor and LOFT late Thursday.

SWOOSH: Nike fell after warning that a stronger U.S. dollar will dampen its results this quarter. Strong demand for its shoes and apparel ahead of the World Cup in June helped its beat expectations in the previous quarter, the company said late Thursday. Nike, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, lost $2.50, or 3 percent, to $76.77.

BOOTED: Symantec slumped $2.85, or 14 percent, to $18.08. The maker of security software abruptly fired its CEO late Thursday. It was the second time in less than two years that the company has dismissed its chief executive.

OVERSEAS: European indexes closed slightly higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.2 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent. Russia’s stock market sank 1.3 percent.

In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.2 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.7 percent. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

TREASURYS AND COMMODITIES: Prices for U.S. government bonds were little changed. The yield on the 10-year government was 2.77 percent. The price of crude oil rose $1.15 to $100.05 a barrel. Gold gained $5.60 to $1,336.10 an ounce.###1764||Empty###1765||Empty###1766||Empty###1767||Empty###1768||Gamers who have a pile of used games which they no longer require will have the opportunity to trade them in at participating Walmart stores in exchange for gift cards later this month thanks to a new game trade-in service being launched by Walmart.

Designs on pushing Mulberry upmarket have received a setback with the resignation of its chief executive only two years after he was appointed.

The sudden exit of Bruno Guillon, coming after a string of profit warnings and a collapse in the designer’s share price, leaves Mulberry with two key positions vacant.

The Somerset-based company has been without a creative designer for six months and cancelled its show at London Fashion Week.

Investors reacted positively to Mr Guillon’s departure, however, and the shares closed 33½p, or 5.26 per cent, higher at 670p. Paddy Power, the bookmaker, has installed LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, as the favourite to buy the company this year.

As we head into the final few weeks, we have a pretty good idea of how many young healthy people there will be, and the answer is: a whole lot fewer than the healthcare wonks were expecting."The Obama administration estimated that roughly 40 percent of Obamacare's enrollees would need to be between the ages of 18 and 35 to keep Obamacare financially solvent and premiums would cover costs.As of March 1, just 25 percent of those enrolled were young people. McArdle cites figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation which indicate that if enrollment remains at that level by the end of March, costs would be 2.45 percent more than premiums. Additionally, even if youth enrollment increased to 33 percent, costs would still be greater than premiums at 1.1 percent.The Obama administration has insisted that the rate of enrollment for the young would accelerate in the final weeks, and has orchestrated a major push to sign up young people before the March 31 deadline.But McArdle points out that even in the unlikely event that "enrollment is truly massive," it still won't be enough.Insurance officials emphasized that rate hikes will vary significantly depending on the region and the carrier, but areas of the country with older, less healthy populations are likely to be affected most.The industry warnings come less than a week after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted to congressional lawmakers that rates would increase in 2015. She emphasized, however, that growth would be slower than in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported."The increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act," Sebelius said during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.One official said he believes Sebelius' comments were a "pre-emptive strike" and an attempt to "soften up the American public" to the likelihood of premium increases."My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant," Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The Hill. "That was her way of getting out in front of it."Other health industry insiders say it's too soon to assess the accuracy of Sebelius' predictions."Health premiums increase every year, so the odds are very good that they will increase next year, as well. None of that is news. The question is whether it will be a lot or a little. That depends in part on how big the insurers think the exchanges will be," David Cutler, one of Obamacare's architects, told The Hill.Jon Gruber, who also helped design the new healthcare program, said, "The bottom line is that we just don't know. Premiums were rising 7 to 10 percent a year before the law. So the question is whether we will see a continuation of that sort of single-digit increase, as Sebelius said, or whether it will be larger."The picture is expected to become clearer as insurers begin the process this spring of filing their rate proposals with state insurance commissioners.It is possible that some insurers will continue to hold rates low to remain competitive, though some initially underpriced their policies to attract customers in the first year, expecting to raise rates in the second year, according to The Hill.If the predictions of major rate increases come to fruition, the political fallout for the Democrats — who will already be under intense pressure in the midterm elections due to the troubled healthcare law — could be even more significant.Rate hikes would also likely undermine Obamacare enrollment efforts in 2015, The Hill reported.###1774||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

Diane Black says that the Obama administration’s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers’ health care needs.

“I am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care…your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,” Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.

“In the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the ‘medical loss ratio’, or 80/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people’s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,” Black wrote.

“This is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.”

“If this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?” Black wrote.

“At a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers’ money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?” Black wrote.

Wal-Mart will soon be joining the likes of GameStop, Best Buy, Target and other retailers in dealing with used video games, the retail giant announced Tuesday. Starting on March 26, customers may trade in their old games for in-store and online credit at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club.

The traded games will be refurbished then sold as “Certified Pre-Owned” games at discounted prices in Wal-Mart’s approximately 3,100 U.S. stores later this year.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”



###1780||There’s user-growth and then there’s investors’ expectations for user-growth. You can guess which one Twitter is paying the most attention to.

Late last year, Twitter announced the number of monthly active users was 284 million in the third quarter. That was up 13 million from the previous quarter. Investors’ response to the growth? Shares tanked 10%.

Today, Twitter announced two new features for its social media platform. Group messages and video sharing.

Now, you and 19 of your Twitter friends can take your conversation into private with Group Direct Messages. This might help people who don’t realize that racist tweet was public for everyone to see. And, it might save a job or two in the process.

The next feature should make investors happy. In-app video support.

You will be able capture, edit and share your videos from the Twitter app. Here’s how Twitter describes the new feature.

We designed our camera to be simple to use so you can capture and share life’s most interesting moments as they happen. In just a few taps you can add a video to unfolding conversations, share your perspective of a live event, and show your everyday moments instantly, without ever having to leave the app. Viewing and playing videos is just as simple: videos are previewed with a thumbnail and you can play them with just one tap.

Videos are limited to 30 seconds.

You can see it in action with this Neil Patrick Harris tweet.

Video support is an obvious addition for Twitter. Other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram already have it. Plus, it gives advertisers another way to reach Twitter users. You know it’s coming.

One question still remains. Will these features be enough for Twitter attract more user-growth to appease investors?

Did he perhaps get the idea from former British Conservative MP Louise Mensch?

The decision by Islamist PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led to a fierce backlash by freedom of speech campaigners. But as Tory MP Douglas Carswell reminds us, there were similar demands from UK politicians not so long ago.

Turkish govt daft to block twitter. But do not forget that there were some folk here saying likewise after Ldn riots. — Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell) March 21, 2014

Back in 2011, when London was hit by rioting, Mensch said David Cameron should respond by closing down social media networks.

The then MP for Corby and East Northampstonshire tweeted: "Common sense. If riot info and fear is spreading by Facebook and Twitter, shut them off for an hour or two, then restore. World won't implode."

"If short, necessary and only used in an emergency, so what. We'd all survive if Twitter shut down for a short while during major riots."

The irony of using Twitter to call for Twitter to be shut down appeared to be lost on Mensch - who later went on to found her own version of Twitter called Menshn.

At the time, Cameron indicated he was prepared to look at banning people believed to be involved in organising riots from Twitter and Facebook. But he never acted on that threat.

In Turkey, Erdogan threatened to close access to Twitter in a speech on Thursday. At midnight (local time), access to the popular communication tool stopped, with PC users, confronted with a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority citing court orders, forced to use a virtual private network (VPN) to gain access to their accounts. No access was available for mobile users.

Mensch's call was for a temporary Twitter shutdown - a line echoed by Turkish president Abdullah Gul, who says he hopes his country's ban on the micro-blogging site is temporary.

The move by Erdogen comes ahead of local elections on March 30, followed by parliamentary elections, the build up to which has been dogged by allegations of fraud and corruption.###1783||Russian President Vladimir Putin has hit back at Western powers by claiming he'll protect Bank Rossiya and keep his salary in group despite the slew of strict US sanctions over his inner circle and his country.

In a statement, Putin vowed to also protect the bank's customers and slammed the sanctions as "having nothing to do with the events in Crimea."

Sanctions against 20 Russian officials and "cronies who held significant resources" have targeted President Vladimir Putin's inner circle and a bank as the US turns up the heat in protest at Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea.

Among those targeted are billionaire allies, friends, Kremlin ideologues and close confidants of Putin since 1993. The list includes Putin's chief of staff Sergey Ivanov, banker Yuri Kovalchuk and lifetime friends.

Russia then published a list of 10 US officials and politicians it has banned in response to US sanctions.

The list, issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry, includes House of Representatives speaker John Boehner, senator John McCain and senior adviser to President Barack Obama, Daniel Pfeiffer.###1784||GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has had a challenging time from attacks on its business on all fronts — online sales, freemium games versus premium games, and big-box retail efforts. Now its shares were getting bruised on Tuesday on news that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is directly targeting the GameStop model with a new push with its trade-in service and preowned game offerings.

Walmart said in its press release that it wants to offer the 110 million-plus gamers in the United States a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and to save on video game spending. Walmart said:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

Walmart even said that it is “actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.” And as far as the GameStop targeting, the company may not have been named directly but Walmart said:

When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.

What matters here is that some 3,100 stores will participate, and even more importantly that the credit can be used on the purchase of any merchandise at Walmart and Sam’s stores. GameStop’s used vide game turn-in credit for customers is for GameStop purchases.

As far as what the market thinks about the new competition, it isn’t pretty. GameStop shares were down more than 5% and were still down closer to 4.4% at $38.00 on last look.

GameStop shares have traded in a 52-week range of $24.89 to $57.74, and the consensus price target prior to this news was just above $50.00.

So, can GameStop survive this effort? Most likely yes, but with some pain and competition.###1785||Empty###1786||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Harris, who took over what was then the Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division in late 2011, retired last August after 30 years of working for the revenue department. In an email message that was leaked to The Denver Post, Harris said she had planned to stay at the MED until mid-2014, after the newly legal recreational pot stores were up and running, "but I found that the personal toll of this job was too much." She added that "I found that I was becoming ineffective with my colleagues at those times when it was necessary to address areas of disagreement."

When I interviewed Harris for my 2013 Reason cover story about legalization in Colorado, I found her to be refreshingly candid. Although Colorado's medical marijuana regulations were widely cited as a model for other states, she made it clear that they were largely arbitrary and difficult to enforce. She questioned the rule requiring dispensaries to grow at least 70 percent of their inventory (which applies to recreational stores until this October) and the practicality of developing child-resistant packaging for cannabis-infused foods. "The current code is extremely difficult to regulate," she said. "What you will hear from many in industry is that this works. Well I'm not as optimistic about it working. If it worked, we would be able to present evidence of how the model works toward good enforcement." This was two months before the state auditor released a report that was sharply critical of medical marijuana regulation in Colorado.

Harris, who worked as a revenue agent and a criminal investigator before becoming Colorado's chief cannabis regulator, had a pretty steep learning curve. "Even in college,," she said, "I did not partake. I can say that honestly. I had friends in law enforcement. My first husband was in law enforcement, which was the environment in which I was raised. My perception of what marijuana was when I came into this division is the little flowers in the baggie that I had seen others carry around." A year or so later, she had learned "much more about the canabis plant, much more about the theory around its medicinal effects and much more about what is actually extracted from the plants other than the flower—the resin and all the products that are created from the resin. So yes, its been very educational."

Now Harris will be educating others—not about the plant so much as the often baffling rules surrounding its use. "It's exciting to be able to bring my expertise on cannabis regulation to Denver Relief Consulting, a firm that has demonstrated a commitment to establishing a responsible model for the entire nation to follow," she says in a press release. "As more states follow Colorado's regulatory lead, both in medical and retail cannabis, it is imperative that individual governments have a framework in which to work so that there are no unintended consequences." Harris' transition is yet another sign that marijuana is becoming an industry like any other, faster than many of us anticipated.

US interest rates could increase soon after the Federal Reserve hinted it is considering a change to monetary policy in the coming months.

Chair of the Fed Janet Yellen stated that interest rates could start to go up in the US as early as next year. Ms Yellen, who was the preferred candidate of president Barack Obama, took over the role from Ben Bernanke towards the end of 2013.

At a press conference, Ms Yellen said: "This is the kind of term it's hard to define. Probably means something on the order of six months, or that type of thing."

Ms Yellen made her comments to reporters shortly after it was announced that the Fed said it is going to scale back bond purchases by a further $10 billion (£6 billion) per month. This means it is now three times in a row that the central bank has tightened its stimulus efforts.

Date of rate change

Bond purchases are now expected to end later this year, which would imply rate increases will start to take place at around April 2015.

Overnight interest rates in the US were lowered by the Fed to zero per cent in December 2008, a move which was a response to the global financial crash, which damaged the US economy.

Mr Obama has overseen a recovery in the country's financial situation in the last few years, but Ms Yellen will now be looking to increase the pace of growth, while making sure it remains at a responsible and sustainable level.

In a statement released to announce its latest policy decision earlier in the month, the Fed said: "This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labour market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."

While the US looks set to increase interest rates sooner rather than later, the base rate in the UK remains at a record low of 0.5 per cent, as it has for the last five years. However, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is reported to be mulling over a rate rise in the near future.

The government announced a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. today and filed a criminal charge alleging the company defrauded consumers by issuing misleading statements about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.



Attorney General Eric Holder said it is the largest financial penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, an independent monitor will review policies, practices and procedures at the company.



The action concludes a four-year criminal investigation into the Japanese automaker's disclosure of safety problems, which focused on whether Toyota was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration troubles.



"Rather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues ... Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress," Holder told a news conference.



Toyota said that at the time of the recalls, "we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust," said Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer of Toyota Motor North America. "In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first."



Toyota said it had "made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."



Starting in 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls, mostly in the U.S., totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various problems including faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats. From 2010 through 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines totaling more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.



The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.###1795||1 of 6 View Caption

There is new satellite data showing floating debris in the southern Indian Ocean.

This new lead comes as the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 enters its third week.

There is still no confirmed trace of the Boeing 777 that has gone missing with over 230 people aboard.

French authorities say radar echoes from a satellite put the debris finding over 14-hundred miles from Perth.



Meanwhile, a U.S. congressman says Malaysia needs to share more information about the missing jet.

GOP representative Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania told CNN's "State of the Union" Malaysian authorities aren't being very open with either searchers or missing passengers' families.

Search efforts have moved to the Indian Ocean near Australia. Nothing was found during Sunday's search.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority says the search area was covered in fog but conditions improved during the day.###1797||Failed MtGox exchange finds 200,000 Bitcoins in old 'digital wallet'

Updated

Failed Bitcoin exchange MtGox says it has found 200,000 coins worth $US116 million ($127 million) in an old "digital wallet".

The discovery comes after the Tokyo-based currency exchange collapsed in February saying it had lost 850,000 coins, worth nearly half a billion dollars, in a possible theft.

But 200,000 Bitcoins were left in a "wallet" used before June 2011, the company said in a statement on its website.

Bitcoin wallets are used for online transactions between currency holders.

The find has been reported to the court overseeing the company's bankruptcy case, the company said.

MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 per cent of global Bitcoin transactions, said the 200,000 Bitcoins - discovered on March 7 - had been moved to an offline wallet.

"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of Bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC," the statement said.

The company filed for protection under US bankruptcy law earlier this month, 10 days after doing the same in Japan after a huge loss of the digital currency.

MtGox's lawyer said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers had gone, along with MtGox's own store of the currency, which she said was about 100,000 units.

Japanese officials say they are closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to understand how and why the exchange imploded.

The global virtual currency community was shaken by the failure of MtGox, which froze withdrawals in early February because of what the firm said was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoin that allowed hackers to pilfer them.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the world.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011.

By late 2012 a coin was worth $US40 and it reached $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $580 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

First posted###1798||Empty###1799||THE new 12-sided £1 coin will be the hardest to fake in the world, but is likely to cost the economy up to £20m in vending machine and trolley modifications.

The Treasury has said the new coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about the current £1 coin's vulnerability to counterfeiting.

"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world," said a Treasury spokesman.

The new coin is based on the design of the old three-penny piece, a 12-sided coin in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

Chancellor George Osborne tweeted an image of the coin ahead of today's Budget.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

The Royal Mint, which believes three per cent of existing £1 coins are fake, said the move would increase public confidence in the UK's currency and ultimately reduce costs for banks and other businesses.

However, the Royal Mint's director of circulation, Andrew Mills, has said it is "a likelihood" that every vending machine will have to change to fit the coin.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mills said the cost to the economy over the next three years for changes to vending machines and trolleys will be around £15m to £20m.

He added that it was important to look at the benefits of the coin and said that the Royal Mint will be consulting with the Automatic Vending Association and other industries to ensure the changeover runs as "smoothly as possible".

The current pound coin was introduced in 1983 as part of the phasing out of the pound note, which was withdrawn five years later.

The new coin will be bi-metallic and will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to ensure it can be authenticated at all points. While the Queen's head will be on one side of the coin, the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the image on the other side.###1800||

Continuing our series of Monkey Cage Election Reports, the following is a pre-election report on the upcoming Turkish local elections from King’s College London Ph.D. candidate Aaron Stein.

*****

On Dec. 17, swarms of Turkish police, acting at the behest of prosecutors known to have links to the Gulen movement, arrested the sons of three cabinet ministers and at least 34 others for graft. The move signaled the definitive end to the alliance of convenience between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Imam who presides over a global movement of followers dubbed the Hizmet (or Service) movement.

In response, the Gulen movement has leaked numerous audio recordings online that purportedly implicate Erdogan, his family, and many of his closest advisers in corruption. The recordings have rocked Turkish politics and have prompted Erdogan to rely heavily on nationalism, political polarization, and questionable legal tactics to frame the allegations as a massive conspiracy aimed at forcing him from power. Erdogan has since directed the bureaucracy to purge members of the police force of suspected Gulen sympathizers, sidelined the graft probe’s prosecutors, and is believed that have played a direct role in the government’s recent decision to shut down access to Twitter. In doing so, Erdogan has sought to transform the March 30 local election into a referendum on his tenure as prime minister, and, by extension, to use populist electoral tactics to absolve him of graft allegations.

To ensure that a criminal case is not pursued, Erdogan is resorting to “strongman” tactics that are eroding the foundation of Turkey’s democratic system. While the Gulenists’ use of leaked audio recordings are far from perfect, their recent actions are a reflection of Erdogan’s previous willingness to use them to advance his own political interests, regardless of the rule of law.

According to political scientist Joel S. Migdal, “strongman” leaders operating in “weak states” sometimes have an incentive to weaken the bureaucracy to ensure that rival political actors don’t accrue the tools and power needed to overthrow them. They therefore have a perverse incentive to weaken certain elements of the bureaucracy, while favoring others. Erdogan has used this tactic before, but, in a significant contrast from the present, the Turkish prime minister previously used the Gulen movement to weaken his main political enemy, the military, and other Kemalist strongholds in the bureaucracy.

The alliance has never been all that cozy and the rash of audio recordings that have since leaked clearly indicate that the Gulen movement had been making preparations to defend itself, should its alliance with the AKP falter. Nevertheless, after the 2002 election, Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Gulenists had an incentive to cooperate. The two Islamist movements, despite having different political aspirations/worldviews, had a shared incentive to further liberalize Turkish society and to curb the power of the military. And, in order to do so, both needed to gain more political power.

After the AKP narrowly avoided being closed down for alleged “anti-secular activities” in 2008, Erdogan and his allies launched a judicial counter offensive spearheaded by the same Gulen allied prosecutors who had launched the recent AKP graft raids.

The two trials, known as Ergenekon and Balyoz, were originally intended to curb the power of Turkey’s “deep state” – and by extension, the military, and other Kemalist secular strongholds like the constitutional court – but eventually grew to include well-known critics of the AKP and Gulen on trumped up charges of terrorism/coup plotting. The evidence for the Balyoz trial hinged on electronic documents that technical analysis has since shown was digitally altered. Nevertheless, the court sentenced 300 military officers to lengthy prison sentences.

Yet, while the AKP certainly succeeded in curbing the power of Turkey’s military, it did so through the use of a bureaucratic proxy that posed an indirect challenge to Erdogan’s authority. Thus, after the military had been marginalized, Erdogan soon faced a new political threat, that he himself helped create. And, like other leaders before him, he had a choice: accept the status quo and try to appease the Hizmet – which would thereby have created a non-AKP allied power center in the bureaucracy – or work to curb the movement’s influence. Erdogan opted for the latter over the former. A clash was inevitable.

To counteract the Gulenists’ influence in the judiciary and police force, Erdogan has since taken steps to bring the judiciary under his indirect control, moved to tighten the state’s control over social media, and has increased the power of Turkey’s intelligence agency – which is headed by a close political ally. Yet, just like in the case of Ergenekon and Balyoz, the tactics are at odds with established democratic procedure, and thereby erode the AKP’s stated intention of strengthening Turkish democracy.

Nevertheless, Erdogan has championed the ballot box as the final arbiter of all that ails Turkish politics. Yet, in doing so, Erdogan is practicing majoritarian politics in an increasingly polarized political climate. Thus, as Turks prepare to vote in local elections this March, an AKP victory in key cities like Ankara and Istanbul could spark further anti-government protests. To counteract such a possibility, the government is certain to take more steps to ensure that the right to peaceful protest is further encroached upon.

And, when paired with the likely leaking of more recordings, Erdogan is sure to deem it necessary to further increase his hold over the government bureaucracy. Thus, even while Erdogan appears to have calculated that increased political polarization is the key to electoral success, it has come at a steep price for Turkish democracy.

While the AKP’s poll numbers may only decrease by a few percentage points (or perhaps not change at all), it will soon be faced with the prospect of governing an incredibly fractured electorate, and a sizeable minority who may deem Erdogan to be illegitimate. The scenario suggests that Erdogan may continue to resort to the strongman tactics he has been using to try to stifle dissent, both inside the bureaucracy and on the streets. And, more broadly, how elections can have “anti-democratic” implications.###1801||Turkish and global social media users have mocked moves by Turkey's government to restrict access to Twitter.

The hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #Turkey blockedTwitter became the top trending topics globally on Friday, just hours after the Turkish government imposed the ban.

The number of tweets from Turkey reportedly rose by 138 percent as savvy Internet users, including the country's president Abdullah Gul, found it easy to circumvent the shutdown.

"The whole world is laughing at you #ErdoganBlockedTwitter," users tweeted, as dozens of images mocking the ban - including one showing Twitter birds covering Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's head in droppings - were shared on the platform.

Another popular tweet shared a poster of the prime minister on a Barack Obama campaign poster with the message, "Yes, we ban".

Erdogan on Thursday night promised to "root out" and wipe out" the social media platform after users published claims of corruption against him.

Leaked recordings shared and linked on Twitter include one in which Erdogan allegedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police corruption probe.

Erdogan insists the recordings are fabricated "vile fakes" and part of a plot to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 election.

On Friday, Twitter users were forwarded a statement by twitter.com from Turkey's telecoms regulator, TIB, which cited court orders for the site's apparent closure.

Workarounds

Twitter also posted a message instructing Turkish users on how to continue using the service via SMS text message.

Many of the country's estimated 12 million Twitter users shared instructions on other workarounds for the ban, including the use of a virtual private network, or VPN, that hides the origin of tweets.

The ban was denounced as censorship throughout Turkey, including by President Gul, who tweeted that "the shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable".

"Besides, as I have said many times before it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely," Gul tweeted to his four million-plus followers.

The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gokcek, became the first member of Erdogan's own Justice and Development party to breach the ban. "I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it," he tweeted.

In response to the shutdown, Turkey's main opposition party, Republican People's Party, announced it would file a legal challenge to the court order.

The closure was also criticised globally, with the vice-president of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes, tweeting that the ban was "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

"Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is," Kroes said.###1802||Empty###1803||Empty###1804||Empty###1805||Last Updated: 19 Mar 2014

The current circular £1 coin has become an easy target for forgers and will be replaced by a 12-sided version, chancellor George Osborne will say in the Budget today.

Introduced from 2017, the new pound coin will be the same shape as the 'threepenny bit' which went out of use in 1971. The Treasury says it will save taxpayers money by cutting down on fraud -the Royal Mint estimates there are about 45 million fake £1 coins in circulation.

'The current £1 coin design is now more than thirty years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time,' said Adam Lawrence, Chief Executive of The Royal Mint.

The new £1 coin will still have the queen's head on one side, and there will be a public competition to design the 'tails' side of the coin.

The 12-sided version will be constructed from two different coloured metals and contain an iSIS security feature - a new high security coinage currency system developed by The Royal Mint.

However, the new coin is estimated to cost £20m to introduce, Andrew Mills, director of circulation for the Royal Mint, told BBC Radio 4 this morning.

This is mainly due to the fact that the new coins will need to be accepted in supermarket trolleys, parking meters and vending machines, he said. 'We want to make the transition as smooth as possible'.

Last year the Bank of England announced the UK will switch to plastic pound notes from 2016, ending 320 years of paper money.

The new 'polymer' notes will start with a new £5 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016 and the Jane Austen £10 a year later.###1806||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after “old format” wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumours of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox’s problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox’s statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn’t specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.###1807||Choose the plan that’s right for you.

In this March 16, 2014 satellite imagery provided by Commonwealth of Australia - Department of Defence on Thursday, March 20, 2014, a floating object is seen at sea next to the descriptor which was added by the source. Australia's government reported Thursday, March 20, 2014 that the images show suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating in an area 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth Australia. (AP Photo/Commonwealth of Australia - Department of Defence)

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Military search planes flew over a remote part of the Indian Ocean on Thursday hunting for debris in "probably the best lead" so far in finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, officials said.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia's southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia's capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said satellite images "do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up."

News that possible plane parts had been found marked a new phase in the emotional roller coaster for distraught relatives of the passengers, who have criticized Malaysia harshly for not releasing timely information about the plane. While they still hope their loved ones will somehow be found, they acknowledged that news of the find could mean the plane plunged into the ocean.

"If it turns out that it is truly MH370 then we will accept that fate," said Selamat Bin Omar, the father of a Malaysian passenger on the jet, which carried mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals.

But he cautioned that relatives still "do not yet know for sure whether this is indeed MH370 or something else. Therefore we are still waiting for further notice from the Australian government."

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Thursday that "for all the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don't have — the location of MH370."

Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they "are relatively indistinct on the imagery ... but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface."

Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been searching in a region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).

Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it took time to analyze them.

"The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action," he said.

The AMSA said on their official Twitter account that the crew of a P3 Orion plane was not able to spot the objects Thursday through limited visibility but that the search would continue.

Hishammuddin said the satellite images, "while credible, still must be confirmed."

Some analysts said the debris is most likely not pieces of Flight 370. "The chances of it being debris from the airplane are probably small, and the chances of it being debris from other shipping are probably large," said Jason Middleton, an aviation professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

The area where the debris was spotted is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic.

The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared above the Gulf of Thailand.

Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Hishammuddin also made clear that although international search efforts are continuing in both on land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres, the effort is mostly concentrated south of the equator over the vast Indian Ocean.

Out of a total of 29 aircraft, 18 ships and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the operation, only four aircraft are now scouring the north.

Norwegian cargo vessel Hoeegh St. Petersburg has been rerouted and arrived at the area in the Indian Ocean where the possible wreckage was spotted, Haakon Svane of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association told The Associated Press.

"It did so at the request of the Australian maritime authorities and it is currently taking part in the search operations," Svane said.

The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia when it was rerouted.

Flight 370 disappeared on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the plane was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.

Malaysian authorities have said that files were deleted Feb. 3 from the home flight simulator of the missing plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and Hishammuddin said he had no new information on efforts to recover those files.

The FBI has joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on the simulator. It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.###1809||Empty###1810||Stock markets slipped today, while major bond and currency markets held steady ahead of a US Federal Reserve policy decision later in the day and as military tensions between Ukraine and Russia ratcheted up.

British financial markets largely followed that pattern although sterling recovered some recent losses before a raft of potentially market-moving news including the government’s annual budget, Bank of England minutes and unemployment data.

Europe’s major stock markets were down as much as a third of one per cent in early trading, following Asian shares lower after the the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.2 per cent.

Underlying worries over China’s financial and property sectors bubbled to the surface, pushing Chinese stocks lower and the yuan to its weakest level in a year through 6.20 per dollar.

This is the first time the yuan has traded more than 1 percent beyond the midpoint set by the central bank after the daily trading band was widened to 2 percent. Global investors’ main focus, however, remain the Fed and Russia.

“I expect gradually the focus to shift away from the tensions between Russia and the West, unless we see actual violence or some type of events other than sanctions that would be seen as an escalation,” Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea in Helsinki, said.

Earlier, pro-Russian units took control of part of a naval base in Ukraine, in the clearest sign so far that Russian soldiers and volunteers who support them had begun to take control of Ukrainian military facilities across the Black Sea peninsula.

Ukraine’s acting defence minister Ihor Tenyukh said shortly after that his country’s forces would not withdraw from Crimea even though Russian president Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty to make it part of Russia.

Later on Wednesday in Washington, the Fed is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus by $10 billion a month for a third time in a row and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.

The moves would represent both continuity at the US central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to indications that recent economic weakness is not solely down to harsh winter weather.

Earlier this monring Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.25 per cent at 6,589 points, Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 per cent at 9,250 points and France’s CAC 40 was down 0.2 per cent at 4,304 points.

The FTSE Eurofirst index of the leading 300 European stocks was flat around 1,305 points.

Reuters###1811||WASHINGTON – More than five years after the financial crisis struck, the biggest U.S. banks are better able to withstand a severe recession than at any time since the meltdown, the Federal Reserve has determined.

Results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed Thursday that all but one of 30 top banks passed muster with sufficient capital buffers to keep them lending through an economic crisis. Only Zions Bancorp fell short. The results showed continued improvement in banks’ financial positions since the 2008 crisis, the Fed said. That built on positive results from last year’s tests.

“The industry is stronger and more profitable than a year ago,” said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

The 30 banks tested included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo and Co.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009. The annual checkup is designed to measure how well the industry would fare in another severe recession. It aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during such a punishing stretch.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment – now at 6.7 percent – would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

Under the test, the losses projected for each bank are compared with the capital each holds as a buffer.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests – even with a much larger number of banks. Fed officials said the change reflected the banks’ progress in shedding delinquent and defaulted loans from their balance sheets.###1812||Empty###1813||Walmart is getting deeper into the used games business, announcing today that it would begin allowing patrons to trade in used games for store credit later this month.The new trade-in service will roll out to 3,100 Walmart stores across the U.S. on Wednesday, March 26th, and later this year Walmart will start sellling those used games back to customers.Walmart stores already allow customers to trade in devices like tablets and smartphones for store credit, but until now the retailer has only accepted used games in exchange for Walmart gift cards as part of an online trade-in program.Walmart representatives are upfront about the company's desire to move in on the lucrative used game business currently dominated by GameStop.Gaming continues to be an important business for us," stated Duncan Mac Naughton, the chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., in a press release.

Maryland’s health exchange this week announced a plan to let consumers who begin the process but fail to sign up by the end of March have extra time to complete their enrollment. Nevada’s exchange said Thursday it will consider a similar 60-day grace period.

And in Washington state, exchange spokeswoman Bethany Frey said customers prevented from enrolling by March 31 because of a system error will have their applications reviewed “on a case-by-case basis.”

The state efforts have not been blessed by the Obama administration, which flatly rejected the additional time.

“The deadline is March 31,” a Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman said.

But Matthew Lawrence, a fellow at Harvard Law School, said it’s no surprise the administration is talking tough now — though it ultimately might find a plausible legal basis to help people bypass the March 31 deadline.

“I expect the administration to wait before announcing any retroactive ‘fix’ for those who tried and failed for fear that an announcement before the deadline could give people a license to procrastinate,” he said.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is confident it’ll have enough sign-ups by the end of the month, including enough young, healthy people, to make the economics of Obamacare work.

Healthier adults are needed to create a balanced risk pool and keep premiums in check when insurers take stock of the first round of enrollment and set prices for the coming year.

“We’re confident that come April 1, you will see a demographic mix that is equal to the objective, which is to ensure that actuarially the marketplaces function effectively,” Mr. Carney said.

Once final enrollment numbers are known, the next question will be what insurers do with premiums headed into 2015.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently told Congress she thinks premiums will rise in the coming year, but at a slower rate than usual because of the law.

Some industry professionals disagreed with Mrs. Sebelius assessment in news reports, saying premiums could spike multifold in some areas because of the troubled rollout.

Dan Mendelson, CEO of the Avalere health care consultancy in Washington, said a spike in premiums on the Obamacare marketplace is feasible, although likely a “not massive” one, and that the exchanges should remain competitive.

He said the March 31 deadline is in place in part to give companies a chance to take stock of where things are.

“You have to allow plans to reset, think about premiums and have a structured process,” he said.

Any tangible spike this year would damage Democratic candidates who supported the law and are up for re-election in November, as Republicans have made it clear they will wield Obamacare’s troubles as a truncheon during the mid-term contests.

The law’s stumbles are even causing intraparty problems in Maryland, where Democratic candidates to succeed Gov. Martin O’Malley are sparring over the state’s glitchy exchange website and the governor is trying to stem any bleeding over the coming days.

On Tuesday, it announced a stopgap measure to help — through telephone guidance — anyone who tried to sign up by March 31, but couldn’t complete their application by that date.

Kentucky’s exchange will allow people to apply for coverage by March 31 and pick a plan by April 15, exchange spokeswoman Gwenda Bond said.

ISTANBUL

Global organizations and the international media have reacted strongly to Turkey’s decision to block Twitter. Here are some of the reactions:“Efforts to shut down Twitter in order to control the news are not only ultimately futile – they sadly move Turkey away from the embrace of human rights and the rule of law, and closer to autocracy. It’s been said that censorship is the lobby of dictatorship. What’s the point of democracy if you won’t give voters the possibility of making an informed decision?”"We call on Prime Minister [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections. Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society."“This is another fundamental blow to freedom of expression in Turkey and the right to access information, and the closure order should be immediately lifted. The move further signals that the Turkish government has taken an anti-democratic turn which significantly sets back its human rights record.”“Erdoğan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began last December. One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, 2013, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdoğan has repeatedly — and angrily — insisted that the recording was fake.”“Erdoğan’s showdown with Twitter has been long coming. In mid-2013, thousands of protests ripped across Turkey ostensibly in opposition to a proposed urban development of Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park. But many say that discontent was more rooted in the government’s shift away from secularism – Erdoğan is Muslim — and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression.”“Twitter use breaks new record in country as Turks defy purge of social media platform by Ankara.”“Erdoğan says he doesn’t care what the international community will say about the blocking of Twitter.“Wiretapped recordings incriminating Erdoğan have been leaking online for the past few weeks. Now Erdoğan reacts. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government criticized Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany’s view of freedom of expression. ‘What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,’ said Mrs. Merkel’s spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz.”“This is an attack on the freedom of thought. Only dictators could dare it.”“Turkey blocks Twitter, is Russia next? Twitter had agreed to cooperate with Russian courts, so, a possible blockage in Russia would be softer than in Turkey.”“Erdoğan is doing it to prove his power.”“Turkey PM blocks Twitter after it became awash with evidence of government ‘corruption’ ahead of elections...but his President tweets on!”###1819||Empty###1820||NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Wal-Mart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards that they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.###1821||"The rise of the East is often seen in the West as a threat, when it is in fact an enormous opportunity.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop’s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers’ grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer’s $55 used version.

“You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,” Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular “Gears of War” franchise, said last year.###1828||Empty###1829||In a note released Friday morning, Baird analyst Steven Ashley downgraded Symantec (NASDAQ: SYMC) from Outperform to Neutral and lowered his price target from $26 to $22.

Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh session lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, following reports that armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol.

hit session lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.24% to 1.3888.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3850 and resistance at 1.3941, the session high.

The euro extended losses after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The euro slipped against the dollar earlier Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

The euro fell to session lows against the yen, with down 0.56% to 140.85.

Elsewhere, the dollar was trading close to session lows against the yen, with down 0.32% to 101.42, holding above last Friday’s trough of 101.19.###1833||Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy this month after it said it lost 750,000 of its users currency, just reported that it found 200,000 bitcoins that were found in an “old-format wallet.”

For you kids at home dealing in old school, E Pluribus Unum kinda legal tender, that’s referring to a digital storage file kind of wallet, not the old leathery kind.

In a message posted Friday on the exchange’s website, Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said ”Mt. Gox Co., Ltd. had certain old­format wallets which were used in the past and which, Mt. Gox thought no longer held any bitcoins.”

But on March 7, Karpeles wrote, the exchange “confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC.” That still doesn’t account for all of the amount that was unaccounted for, plus another 100,000 of Mt. Gox’s own bitcoin reserve. Total value at the time: $450 million. Based on current rates, it is worth about a quarter of that.

Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, told The New York Times that Mt. Gox probably overestimated how much bitcoin it had misplaced.

“I think that it’s yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was,” said Luria, who has written about bitcoin. “That you can lose that much bitcoin and then find it tells you that we’re not talking about robust levels of security and control.”###1834||Today, The Wall Street Journal reports that Citi Bike is in need of funds, due in part to a “number of costly issues, including damage to equipment during superstorm Sandy, software glitches and a difficult 2013-14 winter that discouraged ridership.”

Unlike most other U.S. bike sharing systems, Citi Bike is entirely privately funded with sponsorships from Citi Bank ($41 million) and Mastercard ($6.5 million), along with financing from Goldman Sachs. This limited funding pool means that any other funding needs fall on riders. Raising user fees to cover costs — which is similar to raising fares for transit systems — increases the user’s burden, is not a sustainable source of revenue and, of course, makes it even more difficult for low- and middle-income riders to access the system.

TSTC took a look at three other programs – Washington D.C.’s Capital Bike Share, Boston’s Hubway and the Twin Cities’ Nice Ride – to see how these programs raise funds for capital and operating expenses and what New York City can learn from how these systems are funded. And while farebox recovery rates for each system tend to be high (according to most recent figures available: Capital Bikeshare generated 97 percent; Hubway, 88 percent; and Nice Ride, 62 percent), funding comes from numerous sources.

Public-Private Partnerships

Capital Bike Share and Hubway, which are both public-private partnerships, receive capital and operating funds from a combination of federal and state grants, local contributions and corporate sponsors (in addition to user fees). Hubway received capital and operating funds for the first three years of operation through federal CMAQ and FTA grants, and a contribution from the Boston Public Health Commission, on top of corporate sponsorships and user fees. Capital Bike Share similarly receives CMAQ funding, as well as state, county and city contributions. Their latest system expansion (20 new stations and 200 bikes in Montgomery County, Maryland) was funded by a federal grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board. Hubway and Capital Bikeshare both receive funding from local universities and hospitals as well.

Non-Profit Organizations

Nice Ride receives operating and capital funding from local and federal grants, private foundations, and for-profit companies. According to the organization’s 2012 Annual Report and 2013 Mid-Season Update, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Bike Walk Twin Cities (funded through the Federal Highway Administration) comprise 71 percent of the organization’s 2010-2013 expansion funds. From 2010 to 2012 (the report lacks complete operating expenses and funding data for 2013), contributions from station sponsors, which include local institutions, businesses, private firms, corporations, co-ops and the City of Minneapolis Public Works/ABS Ramps and MPLS Parking, accounted for 40 percent of the system’s operating costs during this period.

The Case for Public Funding

ITDP’s The Bike-Share Planning Guide makes the case that bike share programs should be thought of as part of a greater public transportation system and should be funded as such:

Government funding for capital costs and operations makes sense in light of the fact that bike-share is part of the larger public transport network, and when all internal and external costs and benefits are considered, it is probable that bike-share will have a lower per person cost than any other public transport option.

Other public transportation systems in New York City receive federal, state and city funding. New York City’s East River Ferries received $9.3 million over three years from the City, despite having a daily ridership a fraction of Citi Bike’s. And, as the charts below make clear, the MTA’s buses, subways and rail also receives a combination of funds to pay for operating and capital costs.

System Fare Revenues Local Funds State Funds Federal Assistance Other Funds LIRR – 45% 5% 50% 0% MNR – 64% 1% 35% 0% NYCT – 15% 1% 35% 48%

With over 5 million trips in the first eight months, a recent survey that shows 91 percent of Citi Bikers would like to see the system expand, and calls from outer boroughs to bring Citi Bike to their neighborhoods, it’s clear that New York City loves its bike share. It’s also clear that if Citi Bike is to meet this demand, the financial burden for expansion cannot fall solely on its riders. Regardless of the source, a broadened funding base is key for Citi Bike to expand into transit-starved neighborhoods while keeping bike share affordable.###1835||You are using an older browser version.

COLUMBIA, S.C. - South Carolina's unemployment went down in January for the eighth month in a row, dipping to 6.4 percent, state officials said Monday.

The drop, announced by the Department of Employment and Workforce, is down from December's jobless rate of 6.6 percent. That mark, state officials said then, was the first time in more than a decade that South Carolina's unemployment had been below the national rate.

Nationally, unemployment was 6.6 percent in January, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. South Carolina's rate was tied with four other states for 21st-highest in the nation.

In January, the number of employed people in South Carolina reached a record high of nearly 2,031,000. That's an increase of more than 22,000 people over the past year.

Nonagricultural jobs in South Carolina went down by 4,800 in January but are up by 37,000 compared with a year ago, according to state officials.

Over the last month, only two sectors - education and health services and information - posted job gains, with a total of 500 jobs. Since January 2013, those sectors are up by 5,200 jobs.

Jobless rates went up in all but three of South Carolina's 46 counties in January. Marion County had the state's highest unemployment, at 13.6 percent. Jobless rates were lowest in Lexington County, at 5.1 percent.

Empty and full stations abound in this cash-strapped system.

Thursday was the first day of spring. According to Ed Rademaekers, it was also the worst day of the year for NotSpots in New York City. Rademaekers recently coined the term NotSpot to describe a Citi Bike station that's either completely empty or completely full. As of 10:30 a.m. on March 20, 63 of New York's 330 stations were NotSpots - 59 empty and four full. That's 19 percent of the stations in the system, meaning Rademaeker's NotSpot Index (tracked on bikeshareNYC) was in the red zone. The index goes from red down through yellow and green to blue, when less than 5 percent of the system is in NotSpot territory. Since Rademaekers launched his site in January, blue hasn't appeared much. Rademaeker's NotSpot Index



This imbalance is symptomatic of the larger challenges facing Citi Bike, the nation's largest bike-share system, which has proven hugely popular but is struggling financially. As detailed in an article in today's Wall Street Journal, software glitches and damage from Superstorm Sandy took an early financial toll on New York's bike-share. A tough winter resulted in a sharp drop in daily passes which provide much-needed revenue for the system. And though annual memberships have soared to 100,000, many think that they're underpriced at $95.

The plan was always for the system to be subsidized by sponsorships rather than city funds. But apart from the initial investments by Citibank and MasterCard, there have been no major takers. And new NYC DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg acknowledged earlier this month that Citi Bike faces "a number of financial and operational challenges" and that "all options are on the table," including user rate hikes, to bring in more cash. All those financial constraints led to layoffs over the winter, the Journal reports, which may account for situations like the one Rademaekers noted going into the first day of spring, when the 31-dock station at Allen Street and East Houston on the Lower East Side sat empty for 11 hours. Rademaekers is a retired journalist and big fan of bike-share. He splits his time between California and New York, and when he's in residence at his apartment in Lower Manhattan, he uses the system whenever he can. "I use it in place of the subway to do the errands that need to be done," says Rademaker. It didn’t take long for his annual membership to pay off. "I kept close track of times that I would have been on the subway," he says. "The 99 dollars paid for itself in three months." Like anyone who depends on bike-share for transportation, Rademaeker has experienced the sinking feeling you get when the station of your choice is empty, or worse, full. He started to get curious about the patterns of use, and what it would take to keep the system properly balanced.

Then Rademaekers stumbled upon the maps created by Oliver O’Brien at the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis in the United Kingdom. These wonderful visualizations use open data to track bike-share systems around the world. Now, every day, Rademaekers plugs the data from these maps into spreadsheets, creating a running graph of the availability of bikes. He has grown accustomed to the rhythm of the bikes as they move around, noting that the rush comes later than he would have expected, between 10:30 a.m. and noon. Balancing the number of bikes in the system is one of the primary headaches of any bike share, and New York has been no exception. "More bikes end up in one part of the city, and they don't walk themselves back," he says. That’s a crucial problem. Here's how Rademaekers puts it on his blog: We believe that the system has a decent chance to become as necessary a part of the public transit mix as a taxi or an A train. That can only happen if bicycles are consistently available in all served neighborhoods. And all served neighborhoods must be served equally. Right now, neither condition is being met. Speaking to the Journal, Caroline Samponaro, with the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives, said: "The bottom line is that New Yorkers deserve better ... The arc should be improving." Even before the winter and its discontents, balancing has been hard in New York. People were using the system in huge numbers almost immediately, and certain key points in the network were quickly overwhelmed. At Penn Station, as WNYC pointed out in their story about the problem last summer, truckloads of bikes were being brought back to the busy commuter hub twice during the course of a morning, but it still wasn't enough. (The station has its own nifty map showing usage patterns at individual stations.) "Rebalancing is an ongoing challenge for any successful bike share system," writes Dani Simons, director of marketing and external affairs for NYC Bike Share. As she explains: "With over six trips per bike per day on Citi Bikes during the warmer months, keeping the bikes and docking points available to our customer where and when they want them is always going to be tough. We are using data we collected last year to try to build better routing plans for our re-balances, staging bikes near some of our busiest locations (e.g. near Penn Station and the Lower East Side) and even experimenting with moving small numbers of bikes more quickly using bike trailers this spring."

WASHINGTON (AP) - Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.



The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.



The data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.



Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.



The job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.



Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.



North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.



Nationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.



The states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.



California posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities. It was followed by Illinois, which lost 27,600, and Kentucky, with a drop of 18,500.

Empty and full stations abound in this cash-strapped system.

Thursday was the first day of spring. According to Ed Rademaekers, it was also the worst day of the year for NotSpots in New York City. Rademaekers recently coined the term NotSpot to describe a Citi Bike station that's either completely empty or completely full. As of 10:30 a.m. on March 20, 63 of New York's 330 stations were NotSpots - 59 empty and four full. That's 19 percent of the stations in the system, meaning Rademaeker's NotSpot Index (tracked on bikeshareNYC) was in the red zone. The index goes from red down through yellow and green to blue, when less than 5 percent of the system is in NotSpot territory. Since Rademaekers launched his site in January, blue hasn't appeared much. Rademaeker's NotSpot Index



This imbalance is symptomatic of the larger challenges facing Citi Bike, the nation's largest bike-share system, which has proven hugely popular but is struggling financially. As detailed in an article in today's Wall Street Journal, software glitches and damage from Superstorm Sandy took an early financial toll on New York's bike-share. A tough winter resulted in a sharp drop in daily passes which provide much-needed revenue for the system. And though annual memberships have soared to 100,000, many think that they're underpriced at $95.

The plan was always for the system to be subsidized by sponsorships rather than city funds. But apart from the initial investments by Citibank and MasterCard, there have been no major takers. And new NYC DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg acknowledged earlier this month that Citi Bike faces "a number of financial and operational challenges" and that "all options are on the table," including user rate hikes, to bring in more cash. All those financial constraints led to layoffs over the winter, the Journal reports, which may account for situations like the one Rademaekers noted going into the first day of spring, when the 31-dock station at Allen Street and East Houston on the Lower East Side sat empty for 11 hours. Rademaekers is a retired journalist and big fan of bike-share. He splits his time between California and New York, and when he's in residence at his apartment in Lower Manhattan, he uses the system whenever he can. "I use it in place of the subway to do the errands that need to be done," says Rademaker. It didn’t take long for his annual membership to pay off. "I kept close track of times that I would have been on the subway," he says. "The 99 dollars paid for itself in three months." Like anyone who depends on bike-share for transportation, Rademaeker has experienced the sinking feeling you get when the station of your choice is empty, or worse, full. He started to get curious about the patterns of use, and what it would take to keep the system properly balanced.

Then Rademaekers stumbled upon the maps created by Oliver O’Brien at the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis in the United Kingdom. These wonderful visualizations use open data to track bike-share systems around the world. Now, every day, Rademaekers plugs the data from these maps into spreadsheets, creating a running graph of the availability of bikes. He has grown accustomed to the rhythm of the bikes as they move around, noting that the rush comes later than he would have expected, between 10:30 a.m. and noon. Balancing the number of bikes in the system is one of the primary headaches of any bike share, and New York has been no exception. "More bikes end up in one part of the city, and they don't walk themselves back," he says. That’s a crucial problem. Here's how Rademaekers puts it on his blog: We believe that the system has a decent chance to become as necessary a part of the public transit mix as a taxi or an A train. That can only happen if bicycles are consistently available in all served neighborhoods. And all served neighborhoods must be served equally. Right now, neither condition is being met. Speaking to the Journal, Caroline Samponaro, with the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives, said: "The bottom line is that New Yorkers deserve better ... The arc should be improving." Even before the winter and its discontents, balancing has been hard in New York. People were using the system in huge numbers almost immediately, and certain key points in the network were quickly overwhelmed. At Penn Station, as WNYC pointed out in their story about the problem last summer, truckloads of bikes were being brought back to the busy commuter hub twice during the course of a morning, but it still wasn't enough. (The station has its own nifty map showing usage patterns at individual stations.) "Rebalancing is an ongoing challenge for any successful bike share system," writes Dani Simons, director of marketing and external affairs for NYC Bike Share. As she explains: "With over six trips per bike per day on Citi Bikes during the warmer months, keeping the bikes and docking points available to our customer where and when they want them is always going to be tough. We are using data we collected last year to try to build better routing plans for our re-balances, staging bikes near some of our busiest locations (e.g. near Penn Station and the Lower East Side) and even experimenting with moving small numbers of bikes more quickly using bike trailers this spring." In a perfect world, every station would be half full and half empty, but Rademaekers recognizes just how complex the problem is. He’s hoping that his NotSpot index will provide a valuable way of visualizing the imbalances. "I don’t want to put myself out there as the decision-maker about what is an acceptable service level," he says. "But if the blog started that conversation, that would be great."###1846||Symantec Corp. fired President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett after less than two years on the job, as the biggest maker of security software for personal computers struggles with a shift to mobile devices.

Director Michael Brown was named interim CEO while the Mountain View, California-based company seeks Bennett’s replacement. A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, Symantec said in a statement yesterday.

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem’s ouster in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record PC slump curbs spending on Symantec’s antivirus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock slumped 13 percent today, bringing the decline in the past year 25 percent. Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.

“It’s jaw-dropping,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. in New York who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. “Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”

Symantec shares fell to $18.25 at 10:08 a.m. in New York, the lowest since December 2012.

Executive Exits

Several top executives have left the company in recent months, including Francis deSouza, president of products and services, and James Beer, who had been chief financial officer since 2006 and left to become CFO of McKesson Corp.

Symantec remains committed to its target of revenue growth of more than 5 percent by fiscal 2017, Chairman Daniel Schulman said in the statement.

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth,” Schulman said. “This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

Bennett previously served as CEO of TurboTax software maker Intuit Inc., and before that as an executive vice president of General Electric Capital.

Slipping Performance

Symantec shares soared after Bennett’s appointment as CEO of Symantec, more than doubling in his first year on the job on investor optimism that he would deliver more consistent results.

One of Bennett’s first major actions was eliminating 1,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of staff, in an effort to bolster profit. The honeymoon ended as sales sputtered, top executives left and the PC market worsened, dragging down Symantec’s biggest business unit.

Sales in Symantec’s consumer division, which includes the Norton line of antivirus products, fell 2.8 percent to $2.17 billion in the nine months ended Dec. 27. Revenue in the data- backup division declined 2.6 percent to $1.9 billion in the same period.

The company still likely won’t be able to hit its targets without acquisitions or selling business units, in part because of declines in demand for PC security software, Joel Fishbein Jr., an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a research note.

Mobile Security

One area where Symantec has lagged its peers is security software for smartphones and tablets, a growing market that is dominated by companies including Lookout Inc., which has more than 50 million users and has raised more than $131 million from venture capital firms, and NQ Mobile, a Chinese company with more than 100 million active monthly users.

In recent interviews, Bennett declined to directly discuss the PC industry’s impact on Symantec. In January, he attributed weaker results largely to his overhaul of the sales force, which involved reassigning accounts and training employees to sell different products. He said the company was “making progress” and that the restructuring was complete.

“I’m very pleased with the numbers we’re delivering given the kind of transformation we’ve undergone,” he said in an interview at the time. “Even though we’re a little short on revenue, we’re delivering faster growth for the future.”

Symantec declined to make Bennett available because he’s no longer an employee. Bennett couldn’t be directly reached.

www.bloomberg.com###1847||Symantec's top executives fielded questions from employees on Friday about the abrupt ousting of CEO Steve Bennett, and said the company would focus heavily on bringing new products to market as the board of directors seek a new chief executive.

In an interview with CRN on Friday, Stephen Gillett, Symantec's executive vice president and chief operating officer and driver of the company's recently recalibrated channel activities, said the board of directors decided it was time to return to growth in an accelerated fashion to meet market demands. Symantec's focus moving forward will be to execute on product innovation and bringing new products to market, Gillett said.

Symantec's board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer on Thursday, in an move that shocked many Symantec employees, including Gillett. Brown is accomplished at being a stabilizing presence, according to Gillett, who said he will be a knowledgeable leader and organizer during the company's transition.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005. Gillett said he worked with Brown in 2012 during his tenure on the company's board of directors.

[Related: Symantec Internal Memo: Pace Of Change Was Too Slow ]

"[Brown] will be focused on keeping forward momentum and not stalling as we focus on product activities and accelerating growth," Gillett said.

Gillett, who joined Symantec in December 2012 after holding senior executive positions at Best Buy and Starbucks, has a deep technical background, having worked in information technology nearly his entire career. He said the Symantec's engineering teams have all the pieces in place to build out the portfolio and bring new products to market.

When Bennett took the helm in July 2012, he did a lot of streamlining at Symantec via his Symantec 4.0 strategy, including making the company's product teams report directly to him. Bennett has previously told CRN that move was aimed at boosting productivity and accelerating innovation, but Gillett said Symantec's board of directors didn't feel this would enable the the company to bring new products to market quickly enough.

Gillett said the "apparatus and cadence that allows development cycles to be met happen regardless of who is at the top operationally."

Under Brown, Symantec's project engineering, technical support and research and development activities will all be getting more attention, Gillett said. Symantec's executive team is working on a revised list of priorities for its fiscal 2015 strategy and product roadmap, he said.

"The organizational structure, in reporting to Steve, did little in the way of blocking or changing dramatically the progress we're making in the product roadmaps, integrating our point products combined with new technology development," Gillett said. "There is nothing I see or know that will be coming that should be cause for any concern for our progress to change."

Gillett urged partners to be patient as the board of directors conducts its search for a new CEO. He said he is an advocate of the channel, having procured goods and services from partners. A consistent effort is being made behind the scenes in transforming Symantec into a channel led organization, Gillett said. "That importance of that effort has been reinforced to me by our interim CEO," he said.

Symantec partners tell CRN that they have welcomed the organizational changes and say its time to reveal more details about the company's newly integrated product offerings. Time will tell how this will work out for Symantec, said John Woodall, vice president of engineering at Integrated Archive Systems (IAS), a Palo Alto, Calif.-based solution provider and Symantec channel partner.

"We'll have to wait for Symantec 5.0," Woodall said. "We'll need time to see how the company does. But whoever comes in to replace Bennett will have to define the company's strategy quickly and communicate its plans. This market is too volatile on too many levels."

Symantec is not going away, Woodall said. "It's a strong company. For us now, it's business as usual."

JAKARTA, March 19 — Emerging-market stocks fell for the first time in three days as Chinese developers extended declines and investors weighed prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus cuts. The yuan weakened beyond 6.20 per dollar for the first time since April.

China Vanke Co. sank 3.7 per cent in Shenzhen and Poly Real Estate Group Co. fell to a one-week low in Shanghai after the collapse of a private developer spurred concern the industry may face defaults. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. dropped to a three-month low in Mumbai after the Mint newspaper said earnings would be weak. Russia’s Micex Index retreated 0.5 per cent. The yuan lost 0.13 per cent versus the dollar.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated 0.2 per cent to 950.64 as of 2.10pm in Hong Kong. Investors are bracing for more losses for real-estate companies as lenders pull back from the industry and local governments rein in home values in the world’s second-largest economy.

The Fed is expected to cut its bond-buying programme at its two-day meeting that ends today, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The situation of Chinese developers is a concern for investors,” Laurentia Amica Darmawan, a money manager at First State Investments, said in Jakarta. “The tightening cycle globally and in China will reduce speculative activities in the industry and may cause some shocks in the short term.”

The developing-nation gauge has lost 5.1 per cent this year and trades at 10 times 12-month projected earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI World Index has advanced 0.3 per cent in 2014 and is valued at 14.7 times.

Chinese developers

China Vanke headed for its steepest drop since February 24. Poly Real Estate slid 2.5 per cent, extending its two-day loss to 5.4 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 per cent, snapping a two-day advance.

Stock traders have doubled bearish bets against some of the biggest Chinese developers amid growing concern that a weaker real-estate market will curb property sales just as borrowing costs surge.

The collapse of Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co. emerged less than two weeks after the first onshore bond default by a Chinese company. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. missed coupon payment on March 7.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong was little changed. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. jumped 8.6 per cent in Hong Kong after full-year net income surged 31 per cent.

Uni-President China Holdings Ltd. tumbled 8.1 per cent in Hong Kong, the biggest drop in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, after profit trailed estimates.

Yuan weakens

The yuan touched 6.2009 earlier, the lowest level since April 9. The spot rate has lost 1 per cent in four days. The People’s Bank of China cut the reference rate 0.02 per cent to 6.1351 against the greenback today, the weakest since December 3.

The Federal Open Market Committee will further scale back its bond-buying programme at the meeting, reducing purchases by US$10 billion (RM32.8 billion) for the third time, according to 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg March 14-17.

The Micex fell for the first time in three days. Russia cemented its claim to Crimea as President Vladimir Putin showed no sign of backing down in the standoff over Ukraine’s breakaway Black Sea region, prompting Western leaders to vow further sanctions this week. Putin signed an accord yesterday setting in motion Crimea’s accession to Russia.

Six out of 10 industry groups in the emerging-market gauge fell today, led by technology stocks. Tata Consultancy, India’s biggest software exporter, dropped 4.2 per cent, poised for the lowest close since December 16.

Those comments are already questionable. Obamacare caused the average individual health plan premium to increase by 39% between 2013 and 2014 and the average family plan to increase by 56%, according to data provided last month by eHealthInsurance.com.

These increases surpass the average of the previous eight years combined, a consequence of the law’s actuarial requirements, taxes and fees, as well as the mandated essential benefits.

For their part, insurers are disputing Sebelius’ claim, The Hill reports. They’re expecting premiums to rise sharply in some areas of the country, perhaps double or triple, which is partially blamed on the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare exchange:

Health industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration.

[…]

“It’s pretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out … is going to lead to higher costs,” said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity. The insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange. The hikes are expected to vary substantially by region, state and carrier. Areas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.

[…]

“My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant,” said Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and current senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Hoagland said Sebelius was seeking to “soften up the American public” to the likelihood that premiums will rise, despite promises to the contrary.

Insurers are also pointing out that the age demographics are unbalanced, which will also contribute to the rise in insurance premiums, though that’s something that will be determine on a state-by-state bases, since they determine factor expected costs through the lens of individual state exchanges, not one big risk pool.

There are a couple things to consider after reading this report. First, the ripple effects in the insurance market. Assuming that premium increases do double or triple in some areas of the country, that would likely depress enrollment numbers for the 2015 open enrollment period. Insurers would, once again, readjust with higher premiums. At that point, we’re looking at a death spiral.

Though some have argued that bailout provisions would prevent a death spiral scenario in the transitional period, the fact that insurers are openly warning about very significant premium increases should speak volumes.

Remember, the individual mandate has been effectively gutted for two years. Anyone who doesn’t want to buy insurance could claim a loosely defined “hardship exemption” to avoid any tax penalties.

The other point is the electoral ramifications. Insurers will begin submitting their rates for 2015 in the next two or three months, which state insurance commissioners will have to approve. Though the next open enrollment period has been delayed until after the mid-term election, there will be countless stories about expected premium increases.

Those premium increases will receive a lot of attention in states where there are competitive House and Senate races, and that only serves to bolster Republicans’ chances of taking the upper chamber.###1856||Months after the launch of legalized retail marijuana in Colorado, the state is still trying to better regulate the drug and close the loopholes.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, as part of that effort, just signed a new law calling for uniform packaging of edible marijuana. In an effort to make those products less attractive or accessible to kids, they will have to be sold in opaque, childproof packaging.

State Rep. Daniel Kagan, who co-sponsored the legislative fixes, explained: "We identified these problems and we sought to tighten it up, to make sure that marijuana is really kept for adult use and kept away from under-aged persons and especially from toddlers."

Kagan added, "We do it differently in Colorado. Everybody came together on this."

Children's Hospital, based in Aurora, has weighed in on the legislative efforts -- reporting an increase in emergency room visits and patient admissions from accidental exposure.

Dr. Sam Wang, pediatric emergency physician, said symptoms range from basic sleepiness to more severe cases, where children have not been able to breathe properly and required breathing tubes. "As recreational marijuana goes forward, it's obviously going to increase availability and potentially increase unintentional exposures as well," Wang said.

Other fixes signed by the governor on Monday include giving authority to pot shops to confiscate forms of identification, if they have reason to believe someone underaged is using a fake ID. Another measure calls for local jurisdictions to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal record checks on people working in marijuana businesses.

State Sen. Linda Newell, a Democratic co-sponsor, acknowledged their work is not done. "We will probably find these clean-up bills as we go through the years after marijuana, both medical marijuana as well as recreational marijuana, has become a norm in Colorado," she said.

The issue of stoned drivers is another trouble spot for state lawmakers. At a laboratory certified to test blood samples for marijuana, the director told Fox News there is not a roadside test, such as a breathalyzer, in the foreseeable future for determining if a driver is under the influence of cannabis.

"One person may have a very high THC concentration in their blood, particularly medical marijuana users, and they're not affected. Where someone who has never smoked marijuana before, will have a much lower concentration and be very affected," said Dr. Robert Lantz, of Rocky Mountain Instrumental Laboratories.

According to state Marijuana Enforcement Division Public Information Officer Julie Postlethwait, Colorado has issued licenses to hundreds of vendors, including:

-- 183 retail stores

-- 238 retail cultivation facilities

-- 44 product manufacturers (i.e., edibles)

-- 4 testing facilities (for product potency and contaminants)

Dozens more are pending with the state in these categories. For those with state licenses in hand, they may not be open yet because they have to obtain paperwork at the local level, too.

Local permission can be thorny because Amendment 64, the state constitutional amendment which legalized recreational pot, left it up to municipalities in the Centennial State to decide whether to allow marijuana businesses within their borders.

Dale Dyke and Chastity Osborn, a husband-and-wife team who converted their home into a bed and breakfast, complained that the "laws are very gray." Their business Get High Getaways was catering to marijuana tourists until the City of Lakewood ordered them to shut down the overnight stays. One complication is that while Colorado legalized recreational pot, the state left it illegal to use the drug outside in public or in traditional hotel rooms. For now, the couple is maintaining their location as a car service while working with investors to purchase a new location.

Recently, a marijuana job fair in Denver drew thousands of people with lines stretching a few blocks long. It has been referred to in local media reports as a "green rush."

Visitors told Fox News they're moving to the state in hopes of finding jobs in the marijuana business. Shane Wylie and Matthew Bean are among them. They drove 1,300 miles from Louisiana, just in time for the fair.

"This is our life-changing experience, this is our big step and career change," Wylie explained. Bean added, "I want to start from the bottom, so I can learn everything."

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The Obama administration will soon issue new Obamacare guidelines allowing people to enroll in health coverage after a March 31 deadline, but only under certain circumstances, according to sources close to the administration.

The sources said the new federal guidelines for consumers in the 36 states served by the federal health insurance marketplace and its website, HealthCare.gov, would allow people to enroll after March 31 if they had tried earlier and were prevented by system problems including technical glitches.

On Friday, the administration published in the Federal Register new regulations that would allow state-run marketplaces new flexibility in setting insurance coverage effective dates for people who sign up during special enrollment periods.

President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. It was not clear how much of an effort a potential applicant would have to make in order to qualify for a special enrollment period.

Last December, the administration granted special enrollment periods to thousands of people who were unable to complete enrollment on HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Similar steps have been expected for the March 31 enrollment deadline for several weeks.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could not confirm whether an announcement was expected soon but said the administration would not neglect people who have problems enrolling.

“Open enrollment ends March 31. We are preparing for a surge in enrollment, and if consumers are in line on the 31st and can’t finish, we won’t shut the door on them. To be clear, if you don’t have health insurance and do not start to sign up by the deadline, you can’t get coverage again until next year,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement.

The expected move follows similar decisions by state officials in Maryland and Nevada, where state-run healthcare exchanges have had difficulty handling enrollee applications and are likely to leave applicants stranded by the time the deadline passes in just over a week.

Some states with problem marketplaces had sought to delay the March 31 enrollment deadline outright. But officials say they were encouraged instead to follow the special enrollment model during discussions with HHS. Federal officials said recently that the government lacks the statutory authority to delay the enrollment deadline.

HealthCare.gov was overwhelmed by technical glitches for much of last October and November, the first two months of Obamacare’s six-month enrollment period. Most of those bugs have been worked out and more than 5 million people have signed up for private coverage through the federal site and 14 state-run marketplaces.

With the enrollment deadline less than two weeks away, administration officials have predicted a surge of activity that could test the website’s capacities in the final days of the enrollment period.

Walmart has been expanding its digital video offerings for a long time. The massive retailer operates its Vudu service and began to offer support for Intel’s UltraViolet DRM cloud video library late last year. Walmart has announced a new service for gamers that will launch this month.

Starting on March 26, Walmart will launch a new video game trade in program. Gamers will be able to bring their old and unwanted games into Walmart locations to trade the titles in and get immediate credit in the store. The store credit for the games will be usable for any purchase in the entire store.

That means you can trade in your old games and use the credit for food, clothing, gadgets, automotive service, or whatever floats your boat. The credit will also be usable at Sam’s Club locations as well. The trade-in program works like most others where the user can bring games in the original packaging to the electronics department.

The game will be inspected for damage and then the user will get a trade in value on the game. The credit is then given immediately and can be applied to purchases at checkout. The trade in program will be offered at 3100 stores across the nation. There is no indication of what the trade-in value on games will be. Walmart will also sell the trade-in games after they are refurbished.

Airbnb Founded: 2008 Headquarters: San Francisco Business: Lists rentals in 34,000 cities across 192 countries, charging a service fee between 6 and 12 percent for each booking. Reports indicate that the company has raised around $300 million in private investment to fund its growth. Funding: Venture capitalists have put more than $300 million into the company. : Venture capitalists have put more than $300 million into the company. -- Mike Rogoway



The financing will bring in several hundred million dollars, though the final amount hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal remains in flux. The San Francisco-based company, backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was valued at $2.5 billion in 2012.

Airbnb confirmed last week it would open a Portland outpost with 160 employees to start, and with more hires likely to follow.

At $10 billion, Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, which includes Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It would also be worth more than twice as much as publicly traded vacation-rental site HomeAway Inc.

A slew of technology startups have lately raised huge rounds of financing at increasing valuations, as corporate investors, hedge funds and mutual funds seek stakes in companies before they go public. Messaging application TangoMe Inc. today raised $280 million from investors led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in a deal that values the startup at more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this week, Cloudera Inc. said it raised $160 million, with more set to come from investors including Intel Corp., people with knowledge of the situation said.

Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb lets users rent out a couch, bedroom or house and makes money by charging a fee for each transaction. The company has listings in more than 34,000 cities, according to its website.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Airbnb’s financing. An Airbnb representative didn’t immediately have a comment. Adam Levine, TPG’s global head of public affairs, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.

The Wall Street Journal: Republicans Challenge Administration's Authority

Republicans are pointing to statements by a top Treasury Department official as evidence that the Obama administration overstepped its authority in delaying the health-care law's requirement that employers offer coverage or pay a penalty. Mark Mazur, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said in a January interview with staff from the GOP-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that he wasn't aware of any examination of the legal basis for the administration's authority to delay the employer mandate (Radnofsky, 3/19).

The Washington Post's Wonkblog: Nebraska Rejects Compromise Effort To Expand Medicaid

Nebraska legislators spent the past year crafting a conservative version of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion that they hoped would gain support in a pretty red state. But after a failed vote in the state legislature Wednesday, the Medicaid expansion is officially dead in Nebraska this year. So far, 25 states and Washington, DC.., have expanded their Medicaid programs in 2014, the first year of Obamacare coverage. With some exceptions, these are mostly blue states that joined the expansion, which was made optional by the Supreme Court's 2012 decision on the health care law (Millman, 3/19).

Some Republicans argue that with President Barack Obama's poll numbers sinking and his health-care law unpopular, the party is on course for big House and Senate gains this fall. The worst thing the party could do, they say, is to take up contentious matters such as an immigration overhaul or some social issues, which would divide the party and could prompt GOP voters to stay home. But others say the party has become too risk-averse. It needs to take steps now, they say, to reverse the party's losing record in the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections and start appealing to the more diverse electorate that will turn out for the 2016 election (Meckler and Reinhard, 3/19).

The move came Thursday almost two months after the company reported revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 27 had dropped five per cent year-over-year.

Bennett had held the post since July, 2012.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” board chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”

But, he added, “we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than five per cent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 per cent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

The news caught the industry by surprise.

One financial analyst quoted in SiliconValley.com called it a shocker. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out,” Daniel Ives of FBR Capital markets said. “They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”

Symantec CEO talks up reorganization

In an interview this morning Gartner’s lead Symantec analyst Gene Ruth also said he was surprised at the news. In November the market research company published a positive rating on Symantec, saying things were improving at the company and that customers should continue to look at them for enterprise products. As recently as last month he spoke to Symantec officials and came away with “a good feeling.”

Ruth said he has talked to Bennett a number of times, and found his strategy of pushing Symantec to sell more solutions the right one. “Of course strategies are a wonderful thing,” Ruth added, but you have to implement them.”

Then after the firing announcement was made he spoke Thursday to chief operating officer Stephen Gillitt. There was no light shed on the reasons. In fact, he was struck that the strategy going forward is to stick to Bennett’s strategy, Ruth said, but do things faster.

Speed isn’t enough of a justification to abruptly dismiss a CEO, Ruth argues. It’s not like that board suddenly decided the company wasn’t moving fast enough. In fact, he adds, Bennett warned that the transition he planned could take several years. So he wonders if there were disagreements between the board and Bennett that aren’t being publicly aired.

Sponsor: BlackBerry###1880||A NEW 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that three per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: “After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of “We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit.”

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the “exciting project”, adding: “The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

“It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

“We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.”

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: “Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: “The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.”

Have your say below.###1881||Symantec Corp. fired President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett after less than two years on the job, as the biggest maker of security software for personal computers struggles with a shift to mobile devices.

Director Michael Brown was named interim CEO while the Mountain View, California-based company seeks Bennett’s replacement. A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, Symantec said in a statement yesterday.

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem’s ouster in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record PC slump curbs spending on Symantec’s antivirus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock slumped 13 percent today, bringing the decline in the past year 25 percent. Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.

“It’s jaw-dropping,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. in New York who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. “Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”

Symantec shares fell to $18.25 at 10:08 a.m. in New York, the lowest since December 2012.

Executive Exits

Several top executives have left the company in recent months, including Francis deSouza, president of products and services, and James Beer, who had been chief financial officer since 2006 and left to become CFO of McKesson Corp.

Symantec remains committed to its target of revenue growth of more than 5 percent by fiscal 2017, Chairman Daniel Schulman said in the statement.

“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth,” Schulman said. “This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

Bennett previously served as CEO of TurboTax software maker Intuit Inc., and before that as an executive vice president of General Electric Capital.

Slipping Performance

Symantec shares soared after Bennett’s appointment as CEO of Symantec, more than doubling in his first year on the job on investor optimism that he would deliver more consistent results.

One of Bennett’s first major actions was eliminating 1,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of staff, in an effort to bolster profit. The honeymoon ended as sales sputtered, top executives left and the PC market worsened, dragging down Symantec’s biggest business unit.

Sales in Symantec’s consumer division, which includes the Norton line of antivirus products, fell 2.8 percent to $2.17 billion in the nine months ended Dec. 27. Revenue in the data- backup division declined 2.6 percent to $1.9 billion in the same period.

The company still likely won’t be able to hit its targets without acquisitions or selling business units, in part because of declines in demand for PC security software, Joel Fishbein Jr., an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a research note.

Mobile Security

One area where Symantec has lagged its peers is security software for smartphones and tablets, a growing market that is dominated by companies including Lookout Inc., which has more than 50 million users and has raised more than $131 million from venture capital firms, and NQ Mobile, a Chinese company with more than 100 million active monthly users.

In recent interviews, Bennett declined to directly discuss the PC industry’s impact on Symantec. In January, he attributed weaker results largely to his overhaul of the sales force, which involved reassigning accounts and training employees to sell different products. He said the company was “making progress” and that the restructuring was complete.

“I’m very pleased with the numbers we’re delivering given the kind of transformation we’ve undergone,” he said in an interview at the time. “Even though we’re a little short on revenue, we’re delivering faster growth for the future.”

Symantec declined to make Bennett available because he’s no longer an employee. Bennett couldn’t be directly reached.

www.bloomberg.com###1882||NEW YORK (TheStreet) - GameStop (GME) shares were sinking 4.7% to $37.88 on Tuesday after Wal-Mart (WMT) announced it was about to creep onto the video game retailer's trade-in and pre-owned business.

Walmart said that it was launching a video game trade-in program, in which the big box retailer will go after the $2 billion used video game market.

Starting March 26, approximately 3,100 U.S. Walmart stores will begin accepting video game trade-ins. The traded-in games will be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition both online and in stores. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned," which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition, Walmart says.

"We're going to shake up the market place," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., in a conference call with reporters. "We're not participating in the $2 billion used gaming industry at all."

The move will place pressure on Best Buy (BBY)and Amazon (AMZN), but it will especially hit GameStop as the Grapevine, Texas-based company formed a niche selling video games and gaming hardware.

"This WMT news will very likely represent the latest worry for GME investors and make for another weight upon shares at least near term. WMT is retailing's '800 lb. gorilla,' and we cannot discount any of its moves," Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel wrote in a note to clients.

That said, any "buy-sell-trade" model is "notoriously difficult for even seasoned retail chains to execute," Nagel said. "GME has been successful in the business for a long time. We are very hesitant to discount meaningfully the dominance of GME in the category, even against WMT. The market has worried that used video games might become the next 'dinosaur' in consumer products. We view WMT's move into the category as a validation of the category's longevity." Oppenheimer's Nagel rates GameStop at a "outperform."###1883||Mulberry chief executive Bruno Guillon has stepped down from his role at the British luxury brand after two years.

The US has already introduced asset freezes and visa bans on high ranking Russian officials – now Visa and Mastercard have also stopped providing services to two Russian banks, St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya and SMP Bank.

Bank Rossiya, which was put under U.S. sanctions on Thursday, responded by saying it was working in a ‘stable regime’ and was taking all the necessary legal measures to defend the bank's and its clients' rights and legal interests.

US officials have singled out Bank Rossiya, Russia’s 17th largest lender, because it is the personal bank for senior Russian officials and is controlled by an associate of the president.

However, President Vladimir Putin has since vowed to keep his salary at the bank. He said it had nothing to do with the events in Crimea, and has promised to protect the institution.

‘The management of Rossiya understands the difficulties of clients in the current situation and will do all it can to solve them,’ the bank said in a statement.

But is there going to be widespread panic at Harrods and Harvey Nicks this lunchtime as London-based Russians go out to blow a few hundred grand on caviar and Chanel only to find they get their credit cards snipped in half?

The US has imposed sanctions over Russian individuals for their part in Russia’s seizure of Crimea on Thursday, and it has begun preparations for economic sanctions if Russia expands its footprint in Ukraine.

Moscow’s Micex index has lost more than 10% this month, wiping out billions in market capitalization.

European leaders have also added 12 people to a list of those subject to travel bans and asset freezes over the Crimea standoff.

According to Reuters, French President Francois Hollande declined to give details of the names added to the list, which was agreed among the EU's 28 leaders after six hours of talks, but said it included Russians and Crimeans and raised the total number of people subject to EU sanctions to 33.###1885||ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey blocked access to Twitter on Friday after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the social network where links have proliferated to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Turkey in the past blocked access to YouTube, but it is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country and was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government’s reputation ahead of local elections this month.

Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings on Friday. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan’s, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets.

“I hope this implementation won’t last long,” he wrote.

Many — although not all — users trying to access the network early on Friday instead saw a notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey’s lawyers’ association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey’s main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation.

Twitter’s @policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or “SMS.” It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.” Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, said his office was merely obeying court orders. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating “personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives” and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

“Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,” he said. “We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.”

Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan’s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections.

The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

Sally Beauty Suffers Security Data Breach Of Less Than 25,000 Accounts

Another retailer is letting people know that they too suffered a security breach.

Denton, Texas-based Sally Beauty, one of the largest retailers of professional beauty products in the world, said it found a breach on March 5, which affected less than 25,000 debit and credit card accounts. The company said it was working alongside a forensics firm and the U.S. Secret Service to identify the breach.

The company said it takes this situation quite seriously. They’re working with Verizon about the matter and taking the necessary precautions and actions to deal with the issue the security incident has caused. Sally Beauty said a preliminary investigation was being handled by the Secret Service.

Breaches in personal data have been a real issue for retailers, and has shaken consumer confidence, especially after Target’s significant Thanksgiving security breach. Neiman Marcus and other retailers have said they have also suffered with data breaches during the holiday season. For Target, the breach may have curbed customer traffic.

Sally Beauty has over 2,800 stores around the world including the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. It also provides more than 6,000 professional quality products for skin, nails and hair for salon professionals and retail customers.

Online News Heard Now###1889||Russian stock indexes fell sharply today as investors digested the impact of US sanctions over Ukraine, including possible moves by Washington to target whole sectors of Russia’s economy.

Earlier the rouble-denominated MICEX was down 3 per cent to 1,281 points while the dollar-denominated RTS index had fallen 3.6 per cent to 1,109.

The falls came a day after US president Barack Obama said Washington was considering sanctions against key economic sectors in Russia, including financial services, oil and gas, metals and mining and the defence industry, if Russia made military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine.

EU leaders, meeting in Brussels, have said they will introduce more asset freezes and visa bans against Russian officials, and are mulling wider economic sanctions if Russia further destabilises the situation in Ukraine.

In a morning note, Promsvyazbank analyst Oleg Shagov said Mr Obama had “opened a Pandora’s box full of sanctions”, with future sanctions to be “directed against whole sectors of the Russian economy”.

The United States also introduced asset freezes and visa bans against high-ranking Russian officials and businessmen, dubbed “cronies” of president Vladimir Putin.

A St Petersburg bank linked to these businessmen, Bank Rossiya, was also sanctioned, with US officials saying that the bank would be “frozen” from the dollar. Today, Bank Rossiya said Visa and Mastercard had stopped providing services for payment transactions for the bank.

Earlier the bank said it was working “in a stable regime”. Bank Rossiya is not listed, but the sanctions against the bank - coupled with the US threat of further measures - has raised fears that similar actions could be taken against other Russian banks, echoing US measures against Iran or Syria. Investcafe analyst Grigory Birg said in a morning note that “one can expect a sharp negative reaction in the dynamics of Russian bank shares”.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, were down 2.9 per cent today, while shares in VTB were down 4.3 per cent. However the falls were broad-based, with shares in most of Russia’s blue-chips also down around 3 per cent. Gas giant Gazprom was down 2.5 per cent, oil company Lukoil down 3.2 per cent, steel company NLMK down 2.9 per cent and telecommunications company MTS down 3 per cent.

Shares in independent gas producer Novatek fell by 5.7 per cent. The company is part-owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder of Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy businessmen who has been sanctioned because of alleged links with Mr Putin.

Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from ratings agencies Fitch and S&P that they were changing their outlooks on Russia to negative from stable, because of the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy and business climate.

Both agencies presently rate Russia BBB. Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev said in response that he did not see any immediate impact from sanctions on Russia’s financial sector or creditworthiness.

In contrast to Russian shares, the rouble was stable today, having fallen steeply yesterday evening in response to the US sanctions statement, and helped by the need for Russian exporters to buy roubles to pay end of month taxes.

Reuters###1890||iNVEZZ.com, Thursday 20 March:

Silver today tumbled to a 5-week low of $20.225 as the market fine-tuned its expectation for the start of US interest rate-tightening, following yesterday’s monetary policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee.

The Federal Reserve’s rate-setting arm yesterday announced another $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of its quantitative easing programme, tapering it to $55 billion per month. Janet Yellen, in her first FOMC meeting as Fed chair, surprised the market by indicating that the first US rate hike since the financial crisis could happen “around six months” after the end of the QE program, which she sees concluding this autumn.

If the Committee continues with its gradual $10 billion taper-steps per meeting, the asset purchases would be halted this October, which would imply that Yellen expects rate-tightening to start in April 2015. “The market isn’t pricing the first hike until August next year”, emphasizes Danske Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren.

Following the policy decision, US Treasury yields and the greenback have been on the rise, while bullion prices have been hammered from the hawkish surprise by the US central bank. It is worth noting that after the Fed had announced taper-step number two on 29 January, silver found a bottom the very next day.

However, analysts at Credit Agricole underline that the latest shift in rate-tightening expectations may turn out to be “the catalyst of a sustained rise in US Treasury yields and broad USD strength” that a lot of market participants have been expecting.

Yellen’s remarks were also backed by the Committee’s median rate path forecasts for end-2015 and end-2016, which were revised higher from 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent and from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent respectively. The FOMC also ditched the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold embedded in its forward guidance.

Right now, silver is trading at 20.321, down 1.5 percent intraday.###1891||EBay Rejects Icahn's Call To Sell 20% Of PayPal In An IPO

The coin, which is intended to be the “most secure in the world”, draws inspiration from the design of the old 3d (3 penny) coin, which was in circulation between 1937 and 1971.

It will launch in 2017, and comes following concerns the 30-year old coin is becoming vulnerable to counterfeiting, with an estimated 45 million forgeries in circulation.

In a statement, the Royal Mint said: “The proposed £1 coin design is distinctly British, with a twelve-sided shape which evokes memories of the pre-decimalisation threepence piece.”

The coin will be made of two different coloured metals and contain security features in line with the Royal Mint’s currency security network, iSIS.

The public and industry stakeholders will be consulted on the proposals this summer. There will also be a competition for the design on the reverse, or ‘tails’, side of the coin.

Shares are spiraling on the news. By midafternoon, the stock is down 12.3% to $18.33.

Trading volume of 43.7 million is more than six times its three-month daily average.

Bennett held the position since 2012 and led the charge in a turnaround plan which involved targets of more than 5% organic growth and over 30% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

The firm said Bennett's termination was a result of an ongoing deliberative process rather than any event or impropriety.

Until a permanent replacement has been found, board member Michael Brown will act as interim president and CEO.

Over the last few quarters, the company has struggled with declining PC sales dampening the take-up rate of its Norton antivirus software. Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec reiterated its fourth-quarter guidance of revenue between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion and adjusted earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters anticipate quarterly revenue of $1.644 billion and earnings of 42 cents a share.

TheStreet Ratings team rates SYMANTEC CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.

SYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).

The gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.

SYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.8%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called ''Savings Catcher'' on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

Shoppers do this so often that big retailers that include behemoths like Target and Best Buy have started offering to match the lower prices of rivals — but only if shoppers do the research on their own. The idea behind Wal-Mart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.

The tool isn't revolutionary. For instance, Citibank launched a program two years ago that sends Citi credit card customers a check for the difference if it finds a lower price from an online retailer. But Wal-Mart is the first traditional retailer to offer such a program, and if it's successful, others may follow.

Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart Store Inc.'s U.S. discount division told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that shoppers are looking for ''technological answers to saving them money and time.''

Wal-Mart, which declined to comment on when the program would be rolled out nationwide, said it's hoping the online tool will build more confidence among Wal-Mart shoppers that it has the best price whenever they shop in stores.

The company built its business on offering the lowest prices on staples such as milk, bread and laundry detergent. But Wal-Mart's ''every day low price'' model is under attack from online king Amazon and other competitors that sometimes offer items cheaper. On top of that, the retailer's primarily lower-income customers continue to cut back on spending during the economic recovery.

As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. discount division recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of declines in revenue at stores opened at least a year, a critical yardstick for measuring a retailer's health. The discounter also has seen a decline in the number of shoppers going to its stores.

Wal-Mart has had a price matching strategy for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

Wal-Mart said the idea for Savings Catcher was born last year during a focus group. The idea instantly resonated with the group, the retailer said, and by last summer, Wal-Mart was testing it in four markets on an invitation-only basis. In late February, the company began rolling it out to the seven markets that also include Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., Minneapolis, and Lexington, Ky.

Here's how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on Wal-Mart.com, then logs on to www.walmart.com/savingscatcher and type in the number on their receipt. Shoppers need to register the number within seven days of purchase. Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors. The database is provided by an undisclosed third party that analyzes retail ads.

The prices at Wal-Mart stores are matched to competitive stores based on geographic location, but not online retailers. For example, in Atlanta, Wal-Mart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General. The tool doesn't include purchases on store label brands or those made online. The tool also doesn't apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets, but does include groceries and things like detergent.

The savings are issued on a Wal-Mart online gift card and the customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. Shoppers can use the credit in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Wal-Mart's MacNaughton said preliminary data shows that in the markets that have the Savings Catcher, shoppers are putting more items in their basket and the checkout lines are faster because people don't feel like they have to pull out their smartphones or circular ads to check prices.

Anne Jurchak was part of Wal-Mart's focus group. She said she's been getting back $5 to $7 on her weekly trips to Wal-Mart in which she typically spends $200 to $250. Jurchak has used those savings to buy holiday stocking stuffers and a case for her e-reader.

As a part-time marriage counselor and mother of two sons, Jurchak, 41, a said she's never had time to take advantage of price matching.

''They're doing the work for me,'' said Jurchak, who lives in Belmont, N.C. ''The only thing they're not doing is putting the groceries away.''

You can guess which one Twitter is paying the most attention to.

Late last year, Twitter announced the number of monthly active users was 284 million in the third quarter. That was up 13 million from the previous quarter. Investors’ response to the growth? Shares tanked 10%.

Today, Twitter announced two new features for its social media platform. Group messages and video sharing.

Now, you and 19 of your Twitter friends can take your conversation into private with Group Direct Messages. This might help people who don’t realize that racist tweet was public for everyone to see. And, it might save a job or two in the process.

The next feature should make investors happy. In-app video support.

You will be able capture, edit and share your videos from the Twitter app. Here’s how Twitter describes the new feature.

We designed our camera to be simple to use so you can capture and share life’s most interesting moments as they happen. In just a few taps you can add a video to unfolding conversations, share your perspective of a live event, and show your everyday moments instantly, without ever having to leave the app. Viewing and playing videos is just as simple: videos are previewed with a thumbnail and you can play them with just one tap.

It seems very interesting from all perspectives that shortly after Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28th, suddenly a week later they find 200,000 of the missing 850,000 bitcoins in a “forgotten” wallet. Is it possible that the investigation was getting a bit too close for comfort? We can’t confirm that based on speculation, but there are many investors that have been suspicious of how Mt. Gox has handled several things.In an announcement posted on the Mt. Gox website today, Mark Karpeles confirmed that an old-format wallet used prior to June of 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 bitcoins. These bitcoins were discovered on March 7th, just one week after the filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo. Mt. Gox had originally stated that they lost nearly all of the 850,000 bitcoins. They blamed the loss on hacking, theft and software issues which resulted in the site being shut down. Karpeles also stated that he reported the discovery to lawyers on March 8th, and that the bitcoins were later moved to “offline” wallets for security reasons on March 14th & March 15th.Mt. Gox also filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on March 10th, and their debts are stated to be about $64 million.Today’s startling announcement ends with, “Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC. (Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation.)”While Mt. Gox remains protected at the present time against class action lawsuits, the investigation into all the events and losses will no doubt be a lengthy one. Stay tuned, we’ll keep you updated with any more news regarding Mt. Gox.###1901||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###1902||Empty###1903||Empty###1904||Failed MtGox exchange finds 200,000 Bitcoins in old 'digital wallet'

Updated

Failed Bitcoin exchange MtGox says it has found 200,000 coins worth $US116 million ($127 million) in an old "digital wallet".

The discovery comes after the Tokyo-based currency exchange collapsed in February saying it had lost 850,000 coins, worth nearly half a billion dollars, in a possible theft.

But 200,000 Bitcoins were left in a "wallet" used before June 2011, the company said in a statement on its website.

Bitcoin wallets are used for online transactions between currency holders.

The find has been reported to the court overseeing the company's bankruptcy case, the company said.

MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 per cent of global Bitcoin transactions, said the 200,000 Bitcoins - discovered on March 7 - had been moved to an offline wallet.

"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of Bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC," the statement said.

The company filed for protection under US bankruptcy law earlier this month, 10 days after doing the same in Japan after a huge loss of the digital currency.

MtGox's lawyer said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers had gone, along with MtGox's own store of the currency, which she said was about 100,000 units.

Japanese officials say they are closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to understand how and why the exchange imploded.

The global virtual currency community was shaken by the failure of MtGox, which froze withdrawals in early February because of what the firm said was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoin that allowed hackers to pilfer them.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the world.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011.

By late 2012 a coin was worth $US40 and it reached $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $580 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

First posted###1905||You know how it is: you’re in a tight spot financially and in one last ditch effort to find some petty cash you go to scrape around for coins in an old purse or coat pocket—and come up with $100 million or so. No? That’s pretty much the latest in the saga of embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

After having announced the alleged theft of 744,408 bitcoins—about $350 million at the time—in late February, and filed for bankruptcy in Japan, the exchange has apparently stumbled upon a forgotten stash of 199,999.99 BTC. That’s around $116 million in old-school money.

The news was announced in a filing posted on the company's site dated 20 March. The report explained Mt. Gox had happened upon the trove of bitcoins in an old wallet it thought was empty. “MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain old format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins. Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched,” the filing reads.

Mt. Gox confirmed the unexpected contents of the old wallet on March 7 and reported it to the Court, then moved it to offline wallets for security reasons . They wouldn't want to lose it again, now, would they?

While coming across an unsuspected fortune of forgotten cryptocurrency is the stuff of dreams for Bitcoiners—it’s certainly been known to happen among those who took a punt on Bitcoin early on—this discovery isn’t all cause for celebration.

On the one hand, it does make the chances of some kind of refund for those who lost money when the exchange went down look a bit more likely; there’s more in the pot. But while 200,000 BTC is a lot of money, it’s only a fraction of what was lost. As the filing states, “Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC.”

And what’s perhaps most worrying about the whole scenario is the fact that Mt Gox managed to “lose” 200,000 bitcoins in the first place. It’s one thing for an individual miner to absent-mindedly chuck their personal Bitcoin wallet in a landfill, but it’s another for a company trusted to deal with other people’s money to just “forget” about a $100 million cache.

As Motherboard’s Alex Pasternack has previously written, despite all of the faith in Bitcoin’s math, trust in humans (first and foremost those running the exchanges and other Bitcoin businesses) is still essential to using the cryptocurrency. Surprises—even good ones—don’t exactly fill people with confidence when it comes to dealing with their finances.

This latest episode will only raise more questions about quite how poor record-keeping at Mt. Gox was, and will do little to raise the company’s reputation. One look at the Reddit Bitcoin community’s reactions makes it clear people aren’t exactly jumping for joy at Mt. Gox’s sudden windfall.

The details of the whole debacle are still mired in mystery right now as court proceedings continue, and this latest twist comes with a disclaimer on the initial reported loss: "Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation."

The only really good surprise for those who lost money through Mt. Gox's collapse right now would be if they got all of their bitcoins back. Unfortunately, it's still looking like that really would be a surprise.###1906||WASHINGTON — A government watchdog says more than 20,000 taxpayers have been targeted by fake IRS agents in the largest phone scam the agency has ever seen.

Wal-Mart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors. The world's largest retailer began offering the feature that's called ''Savings Catcher'' on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.

The move by Wal-Mart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise. After all, Americans already increasingly are searching for the lowest prices on their tablets and smartphones while in checkout aisles.

All other banking operations, including deposit withdrawals and bank payments, proceed as usual, the bank said in a statement, adding that its correspondent accounts abroad were functioning as per normal and the bank had not been informed about any interruptions in its lines of credit.

The United States on Thursday expanded its sanctions against Russia, and SMP Bank co-owners Arkadiy and Boris Rotenbergs were also hit by the sanctions.

SMP Bank holds a controlling interest in Latvia's SMP Bank, where both Rotenbergs are members of the council.

However, bankcards issued by the Latvian branch of SMP Bank are not affected by the U.S. move, SMP Bank board member Maija Treija said.

The Latvian SMP Bank is an independent bank that operates pursuant to the rules and regulations of the European Union, and it is not a branch of Russia's SMP Bank. Therefore, the decision by Visa and MasterCard to block the operations with bank cards issued by Russia's SMP Bank have no effect on the Latvian bank, stressed Treija.

SMP Bank honors all obligations to its customers, said Treija.

The Latvian SMP Bank also has a branch in Lithuania.###1912||Empty###1913||Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has had it in for Twitter ever since a stream of damaging leaks alleging widespread corruption in his inner circle spread via the social network.

Things got more restrictive back in February, as the Turkish parliament passed a bill designed to tighten control of the Internet, allowing blocks of websites deemed offensive.

On Thursday, the hammer fell, with Erdoğan promising to "wipe out Twitter," claiming "They will see the Turkish republic's strength."

As of last night, the hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey, #TurkeyblockedTwitter and #OccupyTwitter were trending worldwide.

So here's how the Turkish people can show Erdoğan a little strength of their own, and keep the tweets twittering on in the Republic.

1. Tweet through SMS

That's right: the over-zealous censors in Turkey's government haven't thought of this one. For the time being, Turkish users wondering how to access Twitter in Turkey can send tweets via their mobile network.

Twitter's Policy account tweeted last night:

Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555.

This is certainly a good option for Turkish users trying to access Twitter, but some users have voiced worries that this could lead to authorities tracking down individual users and taking action against them.

For the time being, it's probably best not to tweet anything too inflammatory using this method, as remember it will tie your Twitter handle to your phone contract and identity.

Which brings us on to...

2. Changing DNS

To the amusement of many online, the Turkish government is using a simple Domain Name System (DNS) block to black out Twitter.

DNS Blocking is a strategy for making it difficult for users to locate specific domains or web sites on the Internet. It was first introduced in 1997 as a means to block spam email from known IP addresses. Your Internet service provider (ISP) simply sees that you're trying to connect to Twitter and refuses to serve you, possibly redirecting you to another page.

The solution is simple in this case: change your DNS. There are many different options for DNS solutions, some paid-for, some free. Your best bet in our view is to use a free solution like Google DNS or OpenDNS.

Turkish users: try some of these out and let us know how much success you have!

Update: As of Saturday, the Turkish government has also blocked Google DNS. OpenDNS appears to still be working.

3. Use a VPN

Another solution is to use a VPN connection.

Setting up a VPN usually requires shelling out a little cash, however there are a number of free options.

Check out our recent list of the best free-to-use VPN providers out there.

But be careful: people should be cautious when using free VPNs. They can be unreliable, or in some cases, contain malicious software. Make sure to scan any downloaded files with leading antivirus software, and check around on forums for malware warnings before downloading anything you don't 100 per cent trust.

That's not all, though: whatever free VPN product you may consider, bear in mind that there are a few caveats. While most free VPN software employs some sort of security for the data connection, you certainly aren't getting the security strength of paid and business VPN products. So if you're doing anything that might get you in trouble, you might want to consider our final option...

Update: The most popular choice so far has been Hotspot Shield, a free VPN service that at the time of writing is being downloaded 270,000 times a day in Turkey.

4. The deep web (TOR)

That's right: the favoured haven of terrorists, drug dealers and illegal pornographers could actually be your most effective weapon in the fight against Internet censorship in Turkey.

This open source tool was born as a US Navy project, but now it's used by all kinds of people worldwide, including the hacktivist group Anonymous.

When you surf through TOR, your browser's data requests take a circuitous route through randomly-chosen TOR servers. All traffic is encrypted except the final connection from a TOR server to the actual website. Anyone intercepting a packet along the way won't learn anything about you or the destination website.

First, download the client, and then you're set!
