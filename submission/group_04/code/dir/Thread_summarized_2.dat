We see little churn risk from price hike Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) formally announced a $20 increase for the Prime membership program to $99, beginning with annual customer renewals.
For context, Amazon has held the Prime price steady for nine years, even as fuel and transportation costs have risen, and as the company added significant inventory of physical and digital products eligible for Prime.
Price increase was expected, but rollout staggeredAccording to an e-mail we received from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the 2014 annual Prime renewals will continue at the original price of $79, while 2015 renewals will reflect the higher $99 price.
In our view, Amazon Prime helps to amplify the first two drivers, and as such, we see little likelihood of meaningful churn from the price increase.###2257||Empty###2258||US Navy Seals have boarded a North Korean-flagged oil tanker that was loaded up at a rebel-held Libyan port earlier this month.

However, adjustable-rate mortgages, with their low introductory interest rate, have been rebounding recently in loan the market.
According to Freddie Mac’s ARM Annual Survey, in January 2014 the interest-rate savings for a 5/1 hybrid ARM with a 30-year term compared to the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage amounted to about 1.36 percentage points.
On a $250,000 loan, this results in $194 in principal and interest savings during the first five years of the ARM loan versus a fixed-rate mortgage.

The announcement comes after Alibaba struggled to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve a proposed governance structure that would allow its partners to nominate a majority of its board of directors.

Half of the House majority is aligned with leadership and supports passing a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act before the Nov. 4 elections.

Although U.S. spot gas prices are low, however, forward curves show prices rising in North America while Europe's contracts come down.
That means even just slight further rebates by Russia or a move towards more EU spot market indexation would effectively push U.S. LNG out of the market in Europe.
That points to LNG cargoes steering away from Europe towards higher-value Asian and Latin American markets given current price trends.
That policy allowed Russian gas exports to Europe last year to rise to record levels, while LNG suppliers or pipeline competitors like Norway's Statoil saw their European market shares shrink.###3001||LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Tuesday defended the bank's forward-guidance framework on interest rates, saying it has contributed to the strength of the labor market.
